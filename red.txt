Yeah. Well, we’ll see about that.
Good afternoon. I’m here to see Assistant Director Harold Cooper.
I do not. Tell him it’s Raymond Reddington.
Ouch.
Evidently someone with the authority to make decisions has arrived. I think I smell the stench of your cologne, Agent Cooper. Smells like hubris.
You must have many questions, so let’s begin with the most important one. Why I’m here. Remember the 1986 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, the abduction of the six foreign nationals from the French consulate in Algiers in ’97, or the 2002 breach of the Krungthai Bank in Bangkok? You see these events as unrelated. I can tell you one man is responsible for all three. His name is Ranko Zamani. You want him. I want him. So let’s say for the moment our interests are aligned.
Then a dead man just stepped off United 283 from Munich to Dulles.
Were you wrong?
Yes, you were wrong. At least it’s not the first time. Familiar territory. Now, I’ll give you Zamani, but first –
Agent Cooper, you’ve overestimated your authority. I said I’ll help you find Zamani, and I will. But from this point forward, there’s one very important rule: I speak only with Elizabeth Keen.
Agent Keen, what a pleasure.
You got rid of your highlights. You look much less … Baltimore. Do you get back home much?
I haven’t been home in years.
Oh, I think you’re very special…  Within the hour, Ranko Zamani will abduct the daughter of U.S. General Daniel Ryker. There’ll be some kind of diversion, communications will be scrambled, then he’ll grab the girl. He wants to be out of the country within 36 hours. If you don’t move quickly, she will die. That’s what I know.
Because I’m the one who got him into the country.
No, of course not! I’m a criminal. Criminals are notorious liars. Everything about me is a lie. But if anyone can give me a second chance, it’s you.♤ The two of us have overcome so much. I mean, look at you. Abandoned by a father who was a career criminal, a mother who died of weakness and shame. And yet here you are, about to make a name for yourself, about to capture Ranko Zamani. I’m gonna make you famous, Lizzy.♤
My people? I told you Zamani would take the girl. I told you that’s all I knew. This is in your hands now.
How about a trade? You tell me and I’ll tell you. Tell me about the scar on your palm. I’ve noticed how you– stroke it.
Someone tried to hurt you.
May I see it? Is a child really what you want?
But a baby won’t fix what happened in the past.
You won’t find the girl until you learn to look at this differently.
Like a criminal. May come easier than you think. Shall I show you? 
Well, at least you know what Zamani looks like. Oh, my goodness! I haven’t seen him in years. Very interesting fellow. Completely unrelated to this. You’re pointing at the wrong guy here. Miroslav. They call him The Chemist. A highly regarded munitions expert. He left MIT to work for the Russian, Vor Usoyan. Last two years – very expensive freelancer. I don’t know what the hell any of this is. Ooh, the German. A banker. Name’s Reinhardt. He’s most likely moving the money. What about the girl? What do you have on the girl and her father?
What about the Chemist?
You’re thinking like a cop. Cops are so objective. They’re obligated to protocols. Make it personal.
So what does he desperately want before he dies? And how does that relate to the little girl?
I have an acquaintance. They call him The Innkeeper, runs a series of safe houses. Lean on him. He’ll know where to find the Chemist. You find the Chemist, you’ll find Zamani.
If I tell you, you have to give me something in return. No more restraints, no more cages. If you want to capture Zamani, he has to believe I’m moving freely, in touch with old friends, staying in one of my favorite hotels…
Save your Starwood points, Harold. The Sheraton’s not my scene.
No, thank you, Eric. [ To Ressler: ] Tip the gentleman, will you? 
Did what?
Calm down and tell me what happened.
Did he mention the girl or the bomb?
Zamani.
What did he say?
So the bomb’s still in play.
The truth is, despite your feelings, your husband doesn’t matter. Zamani did you a favor, Lizzy.
Yeah. But if I die you’ll never know the truth about your husband.
It’s good to see you, old friend.
How did things go with Agent Keen?
And the husband?
It’s a shame you’re gonna miss the cherry blossoms.
Tell me, the General’s daughter is such a risk.
There’s a wrinkle. Zamani wants more than the General’s daughter. He’s after children.
I need you to tell me what Zamani said. In the house what did he say, what did you see?
No. What did you see?
Take a breath, Lizzy.
He’s Serbian Orthodox.
He wouldn’t have a tattoo.
Whatever you do, don’t touch it.
Your people will never be there in time. My friend, he’s on his way.
[ Walking up ] Just consider the device his payment for services.
Nos dash daisa!
He’s fascinated by the things. He certainly has more use for it than we do.
[ As Ressler handcuffs him; To Liz: ] We’re gonna make a great team.
I’m not gonna tell you.
He took it. That’s the price of doing business, Harold, with certain people who can get certain things done. You know that. You never look at the larger picture. The bomb didn’t detonate, the girl is safe, Zamani’s dead. Frankly, I think this all went down rather swimmingly.
Your intelligence?
I certainly don’t want your intelligence, Agent Ressler. I’m quite happy with my own. I think it’s more likely that I tried to help you in good faith and had to finish the job myself because you couldn’t.
Well, this was fun. Let’s do it again. Really, let’s do it again. Understand, Zamani was only the first.
Name. On the list.
It’s called The Blacklist. That sounds exciting. That’s why we’re all here, of course. My wish list. A list I’ve been cultivating for over twenty years. Politicians, mobsters, hackers, spies.
Agent Ressler, please. We all know your Top Ten is little more than a publicity campaign. It’s a popularity contest at best. I’m talking about the criminals who matter. The ones you can’t find because you don’t even know they exist. Zamani was a small fish. I’m Ahab. And if you want the whales on my list, you have to play by my rules. I never sleep in the same location for more than two nights in a row. I want a fully encrypted 8-millimeter tag embedded in my neck not that garbage from AlphaChip you stuck in my shoulder. I want my own security I’ve compiled a list of five acceptable applicants. Pick two. Whatever I tell you falls under an immunity package that I negotiate myself. And finally, most importantly, I speak only with Elizabeth Keen.
You’ve discovered something curious about your husband, haven’t you, Lizzy?
Convicted? Not yet.
You’re wasting valuable time.
[under interrogation]: Yes.
No. [polygraph spikes]
You’re asking the wrong questions. I’m trying to help you with a matter of some urgency. It’s your choice whether you listen to me or not, but there will be an incident at 11:00 this morning at the Decatur Industrial Park. I would send ambulances. We need to move quickly.
Because you don’t return my calls, Harold. If you want to save lives and catch the bad guys, pay attention.
That’s unfortunate. The next name on my list is an absolute snake.
I know lots of things. But the train I didn’t. I knew the time, the place, but the train was a big surprise.
Look at the list of casualties, Harold. You’ll find some councilwoman from Albany. Apparently she’s been tangling with some rather cunning, powerful people.
I’m not saying anything. Unless it’s to Elizabeth Keen.
If you had any idea how far I’ve traveled to see you again, Lizzy.
How is Tom?
Oh, I think they will. Otherwise, what am I doing here? I’m perfectly happy to go back to the boat.
What would you like to know?
The train accident was no accident. You know that. But what you don’t know is the man behind it. Is quite prolific. He’s responsible for a slew of other premeditated killings just like this one, disguised as accidents. Shall I go on? ⋘⋙  A building collapses in Moscow, a ferry capsizes on the Brahmaputra River. These are the events we’ve come to expect on the evening news. But in truth, there’s always more to the story. Hidden between the facts and figures, the victims and the heroes, there’s always a murder. The work of a man who disguises his killings in the headlines of everyday tragedies.
His work is difficult to detect, but the victims are there. An appellate court judge in Ohio, a French diplomat who dies in a plane crash. Look closer. The pattern will emerge. Over the last seven years, more than 3,000 innocent civilians have died, all collateral victims as a result of this man’s unique methods. In the 20–odd years I’ve been working my side of the tracks, I have not encountered another contractor who’s had as significant an impact on the civilian population as he. He’s rivaled only by governments and terrorist organizations. And you’ve never heard of him.
I have it on good authority that his next contract will take him to New York. This is not an opportunity to ponder or deliberate, because once he’s done, he’s gone.
They call him “The Freelancer.”
You don’t find him. I do.
I don’t have e-mail or a phone or an address. I prefer to handle my business face–to–face.
Once. I brokered a few jobs. He works through an intermediary. He might be for sale. Perhaps I should set a meeting.
[To Liz] You should come. Just the two of us – no wires, no clumsy agents in the bushes. You want me to make an introduction, you need to trust me with my source. Ah! What fun! You’ll need a dress.
Montreal.
What passports?
Put what, Lizzy?
Who else have you told? What?
Have you told Cooper?
[to Liz] If you go to the police, they’ll file charges. If the gun’s not registered, it’s a felony. The passports are 25 years each. On the other hand, if you confront him, what good does that do? He’ll deny everything, and you’ll continue to doubt him. Either way, it’s an impossible situation.
I agree with you completely. But it is a restaurant, and it is dinnertime.
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Bonsoir. Ãa va? Anyone asks, you’re my girlfriend♤ from Ann Arbor.
Fine. You can be my daughter.♤
What would you like to drink?
S’il vous plaít, pour madame, un cocktail de I’aviation.
Ahh.
Mercí. To the future. Aviation cocktail.
It’s from the ’20s.
Tastes like spring, doesn’t it? Tell me about your job. The profiling. I’m fascinated. How close to the truth do you think you can really get?♤
Tell me my profile.
You’ve heard the debriefs. You’ve read Ressler’s book reports. I so want to know how you see things.
Tell me about your husband. Does he know you as well as you know him?
Does he know about you as a child?
Does he know about the fire?♤
S’il vous plait, apportez–nous une bouteille quatre vingt deux chateau latour.
What if I were to tell you. That all the things you’ve come to believe about yourself are a lie?♤  Please excuse me for a moment.
Hey, there, guys.
Take a breath, agent Ressler. You think I’m gonna fly all the way to Montreal for the cheese cart? My contact was the first person I saw when I walked into the place. I told you he would help, and he did. The coat-check attendant. I left payment in my hat. In exchange, he left a photo of the assassin’s next victim.
There you have it – a solid lead delivered exactly as promised. Find Floriana Campo, you find the Freelancer. Not bad for a day’s work. Let’s celebrate. Hey, Donald. How ’bout that cheese cart?
Please understand I want more than anything to help you. It’s the reason why I’m here. But I won’t say another word until the terms of my deal are met. I’m so sorry to bother you with these trivial details, but it’s a simple yes or no.
Is this really the right approach?
Honestly, is this how the FBI does things– comb through the invitation list? This guy didn’t RSVP. I’ve seen the man. If he shows up tonight, if you’re going to have any hope of identifying him, you need to put me in that room.
Oh, I thought you’d never ask.
Dembe. Luli, my dear.
Watch yourself with her, Donald. She hates men, and cops most of all. You, I don’t know.
You look like the CIA.
Attractive but treacherous.
This is gonna be a gas.
No. Where’s that woman with the mushroom puffs? You okay?
It’s him.
The waiter. The Freelancer.
Clear the area. Now.
Your security is occupied.
The FBI works for me now.
I’ve never liked you.
I don’t know how you do it – the duplicity. How does the devil in you contend with the angel? I would have kicked her out years ago.
To do what? Was it the champagne? What’s the headline gonna read? “Italian dog born with two heads. No? How about “humanitarian, exposed as fraud, commits suicide”?
I didn’t do anything. I think the assassin may have slipped her a lethal cocktail of the same barbiturates she uses to drug her children.
She’s not the woman you think she is.
Who’s lying, Floriana?
Ooooh, that was a mistake.
You don’t need a medic. I have the antidote right here.
I’d be happy to, as soon as she admits the truth.
Tell her the truth, Floriana.
Madam Campo doesn’t free children from slavery. She imprisons them.
Don’t be so naive. Floriana Campo is the largest distributor of enslaved children in the eastern hemisphere. Her Foundation is a front to launder the profits of the Eberhardt cartel, which she runs. She’s been eliminating the competition.
The woman had her own husband murdered.
All you have to do is tell her, Floriana. A simple nod will suffice.
To Liz] What is with you in hotel rooms and pens in people’s necks?
Looks like she’s dying. Definitely dying.
You look tired. Go home. Get some sleep. Unless you’re avoiding your home.
There was no antidote.
She preyed on the weak and the innocent while dressed in the wings of a savior. I detested everything about her.
We never really know anyone, do we?♤ What are you gonna do, Lizzy? About this situation with Tom? It seems you have two options. Either you turn him in or confront him. Or perhaps there’s a third option. …
 Good God. Not here. The gentleman I usually contract with is unavailable – stung by a manta ray off the barrier reef in Belize. I have another tech in mind.
 Speak with Luli about the replacement I’m offering. Conduct your due diligence. If things are in order, we can proceed as discussed. I prefer to play with myself in private.
 An opportunity has come our way. Yesterday, the Chinese killed a C.I.A. agent in Shanghai. They took his computer, which they thought could decode a message they intercepted. It couldn’t. They’ve asked me to help. [ Lizzie motions at clerk ] Oh, Rodrick is a dear old friend.
 Now, you see, you make it sound like treason. So black and white. It’s not. It’s green.♤ The fact is, American secrets are for sale by an assortment of reputable vendors, myself included. If I don’t do this, someone else will. The man who’s paying me is called Wujing. Perhaps you’ve heard of him. Formerly, he worked for the Ministry of State Security. He’s not officially sanctioned by the Chinese. But unofficially, he’s contracted to take out rival agents – American, British. The message likely contains the name of another agent.
 Intriguing, isn’t it?
 That’s what they said about Deep Throat … and the G-Spot.♤ I assure you Wujing is quite real, and he’s hired me. Now you have the chance to catch him. I’ve already forwarded them your cover.
 Carolyn Givins, PhD in Applied Physics from M.I.T. I’ve told them you’re my new encryption specialist.
 Listen, this is a guy who the intelligence community has been talking about for decades as if he were a figment. You don’t even know if he’s real or not. Well, he is real – very. And I’m giving you the opportunity to grab him. Now, the good news is he’s not even in China. He’s right here in your own backyard. If we play our cards right, I can still make Lisbon by breakfast. Rodrick, both.
 Look at you, camel trading like a Bedouin.
 Such as?
 Well, then, we need to move quickly. Things are already in play.
 WDCJ – a small radio station five miles from here. The building was purchased six years ago by a corporation fronting for the Chinese government.
We’ll meet Wujing. You’ll decode the message and transmit it to your team.
 Exactly – both you and the Chinese will know the name of the agent for which the message was intended, and the race begins.
 No.
 I said no. The Chinese may not know what the message is, but they certainly know what it isn’t. We do it for real, or we don’t do it at all.
 You’re a very quick study.
What are we waiting for? (Lizzie joins Red and they exit the building.)
 DARPA tracking chip – eight millimeter tag. I was taken by Somali pirates last March, spent three weeks in a shipping container. The first two were a nightmare! The third one was actually quite pleasant. Even so, that won’t happen again. If you have a clean razor blade and some morphine, I’ll remove it.
 She’s with me.
So, you went with the gray?
 Get where?
 Far enough.
 Don’t be cheeky, Wujing. You don’t have any friends. My associate.
 You’ve made some changes.
 I can imagine – four American agents killed in the past year and a half. You’ve been busy. I presume nothing gets in or out, no radio or satellite transmissions. Nothing but trust.
 Let’s get to work. I once had a bad experience in a deep hole in the ground.
 We ready yet? Do you get home much, Jin Sun?
 Oh, that must be hard. It certainly would be for me. I don’t even have a phone. I insist on delivering all of my messages in person. What province are you from?
 Oh! Beautiful part of the country! I spent a month in silent meditation at a monastery just outside of Kunming.
It was a wonderful escape from the distractions of everyday life. I can’t imagine the distractions one might encounter down here. [ to Liz ] Can you?
Excellent! I think we’re almost ready. This should be fun. What the hell is that?!! I swear, if I run into the same trouble I had with you in Hong Kong – In all the years you and I have known each other, I’ve never put you in a position like this!! You know how I conduct my business. I don’t need this kind of crap!! You assured me this place was secure!
[ pointing to the monitors ] Then what the hell is that?! That van. It was there when we arrived, and it’s still there. That is the FBI. (While Red has everyone distracted, Lizzie inserts the USB key in Jin Sun’s computer.) With all the scans and wands and this elevator you’ve built that goes down to Middle Earth, and you don’t even bother to sweep the street around your building?!! This is nonsense!
You’re under surveillance!
 I’ve been moving comfortably through the world for the past 20 years without a trace, and now some two-bit spy killer is gonna put my life and business in jeopardy? 
 Unbelievable.
 You should be ashamed of yourself. To put Ms. Givins and I at risk, it’s unprofessional. I’ve reached my limit.
 What? Okay. Okay. You know, I’m sorry. I’ve had a rough day. Unbelievable. Should we do this?
 Don’t you miss the good old days with the pay phones and the brush passes?
 This is all the thanks I require. [ Liz glances as USB drive ] Get your things. It’s time to go. [ To Liz ]  Leave it.
 Think hard before you accuse anybody of anything.
Quiet.
 As entertaining as all this has been, we really do need to leave now. The next sound you hear is gonna be the FBI knocking on your door, and I, for one, am not gonna be here. Wujing! Look at me!
 The moment he sent that message, he became worthless to you. You would have beaten him for another 20 minutes and then killed him yourself. But if I let you kill a contractor of mine, I’ll lose the trust of all my others – and that’s just bad business. So if you kill her, you better kill me. Or I’m going to kill you.
 So build another.
 That’s very kind, but I’m sure we can muddle through on our own. Anywhere in the shade up here would be fine.
 I fear I’ve disappointed you. The deal was for us to actually catch the criminals on the Blacklist, and now Wujing is as good as halfway to Beijing.
 We’re fine.
 Luli can stay with me. Dembe will take you wherever you need to go.
 I believe I will always do whatever I feel I have to do to keep you alive.
 What’s the question?
 Because of your father.
 I wish the answer were as simple as the question seems. But the truth is, the question isn’t simple either. I share your frustration.
 I have you.
This won’t take long. Bring the car around. [Reading from newspaper:] “It was only through the efforts of an FBI profiler that suspicion began to fall on Hector Lorca, leading to his arrest and indictment.” Well done, Lizzy. Very impressive.
Your case is about to go sideways.
Lorca’s people have reached out to me. Normally, I wouldn’t give him the time of day. He’s a vicious little drug-lord thug. Certainly nothing there to hold my interest. But their request is of great interest because it concerns you.
Transportation out of the country, new identity, passport, bank account, credit cards, as well as the proper introductions to reestablish his operations elsewhere. And he wants it by tomorrow night. For whatever reason, Lorca is under the impression he’s about to be a free man.
Something is going to happen, Lizzy. I don’t think you’re going to have a very good day in court at all.
The manufacturer has replicated the specs of the FIM–92 with a few small improvements. It’s lighter, more consistent tracking. I’m confident your client will be thrilled.
Yes, you also have a few dozen of those.
Sweetheart, not really the most convenient time for me.
Haiti
Keeping up appearances. I’m a criminal. The minute I stop being one, I become quite useless to you.
What I told you is what I know. Beyond that, I really can’t help.
A man’s life is always at stake and tragically low stakes, at that.♤ I shouldn’t have to remind you I did not offer my services so that I could help you round up your run–of–the–mill drug lord or what have you. You all seem to be doing a perfectly mediocre job of that on your own. I’m after the big game, Lizzy, the ones that matter.
Did you say hundreds? And no bodies have ever been found.
Nothing. You should go home, Lizzy. Pour yourself a Chardonnay and move on. Your witness is most likely dead. I think you already know that. And if what you’re telling me is true, you’ll probably never find him, either.
I’ve been thinking about your case. What do you have so far?
You didn’t find anything.
Tape residue on the walls?
Look in the tub. Run your fingers around the drain. What do you smell?
You see, Lizzy. Now I’m interested.
The Stewmaker is in town. You’re going to need a plumber.
The Stewmaker is a true blacklister. The only fellow to engage when one has a particular sort of disposal problem. He’s a chemical expert who turns his victims into chemical stew, thus the nom de guerre. No DNA. No nothing. He makes corporeal problems literally disappear. But it’s much more than the proficiency of his tradecraft that gets him on the list. He’s a trophy collector. Remembrances of his victims. Memori morti.
Now, you’ve lost your witness and with him your case. But the Stewmaker is the key to so much more. He’s served the needs of international syndicates, repressive regimes, anyone with a need and the means to pay. The Stewmaker knows where all the bodies are buried. He’s got the answers to hundreds of unsolved murders.
He’s notoriously cautious. I don’t even know who he is or where he bases his operation. And believe me, I’ve tried to find him.
Yes. I suggest you encourage Mr. Lorca to share that information. The Stewmaker is obviously here now, but he won’t be for long. And if you let him slip away, he’ll be as gone as his victims and you’ll never see him again.
What you’re forgetting is we want the same thing, Agent Ressler.
I have a contract with Lorca to personally hand him a new identity.
Your witness is dead, you lost Lorca, and he took Agent Keen. I’d say my meeting with Lorca might be the equivalent of you falling on your ass and landing in a pile of Christmas.♤
He’s been evading capture for years. He’ll be more on guard than ever. Any change of plans, and we’ll lose him. I meet with Lorca alone.
There’s no bargaining here! When confronting complex equations, the simplest solution is most often the correct one. You lost her. I can find her. It’s that simple.
Then understand I take no responsibility for your safety. And the FBI backs off. No surveillance, no wires, or you can find what’s left of Agent Keen yourselves. 
No. I’m gonna make him feel safe. Lorca’s gonna walk, and you’re gonna have to just trust me.
You know why? Because after tracking me for years, you’ve come up with one undeniable truth. I only do what’s good for me. And that is a person you can trust, Donald. Now let’s go. Lorca will have questions about you. You’ll need breviloquent answers.
I’m Raymond Reddington.
Mr. Lorca, I’m Raymond Reddington.
Oh, this is Special Agent Donald Ressler of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
He insisted, dying to meet you.
He’s telling his man to be ready to cut off your head.
Better start talking, Donald.
Aah! He’s also a wonderful dancer.
It is indeed. Crooked as a Corsican highway. He’s an asset. So if you’re gonna kill my inside man, the least you could do is thank him first. Your new life. I hope it’s an interesting one. I’ve also arranged a flight to take you to Venezuela. You just need to sit tight for at least 12 hours.
Not with my assistance, you’re not. You’re bad for business. You’ve made a mess. You’ve abducted an FBI agent. I presume she’s dead.
In any event, the city’s locked down. I can’t have you getting busted with my fingerprints all over you. When I arrange transport, it’s flawless. I won’t compromise my people.
So just sit tight. Take your new identity, catch a ride on my plane, and let me clean up your mess.
Yes. So, where is the man holding the agent?
See, that’s the problem right there. You let your emotions get the best of you, which is how people wind up in jail, Hector. Stupid people. I need the name and location of the man holding Elizabeth Keen.
[ Laughs ] You got me. It is personal.♤ I want your man. So let me spell it out for you. You get away. Agent Ressler here saves Agent Keen. He looks good. And everyone feels better about themselves. I need a name. Now.
Then good luck to you, Mr. Lorca.
[ To Dembe ] Time to go.
Dogs are not our whole life, but they do make some lives whole. Dembe, would you dial the Maryland State Office of Animal Control, please?
(Impatient:) Come on.
Yes. H–Hello, Diana. This is Stanley Kornish. I’m in a bit of a panic. My dog has gotten out, and I’ve lost my cellphone with the tracking code. I was wondering if I might bother you for the code and if you could reboot the application for this mobile device. He’s an emotional support dog. Please hurry. My heart, it’s pounding, and I’m having trouble breathing.
We’re getting very close, Dembe. Pull in at the next shop. We’re gonna need meat.
[ Smiles at her ] Hello, Lizzy. The effects will dissipate soon. You’re gonna be fine.
[ to Stewmaker ] Okay. Shall we get started? A farmer comes home one day to find that everything that gives meaning to his life is gone. Crops are burned, animals slaughtered, bodies and broken pieces of his life strewn about. Everything that he loved, taken from him. His children. One can only imagine the pit of despair, the hours of Job–like lamentations, the burden of existence. He makes a promise to himself in those dark hours. A life’s work erupts from his knotted mind. Years go by. His suffering becomes complicated. One day he stops. The farmer, who is no longer a farmer sees the wreckage he’s left in his wake. It is now he who burns. It is he who slaughters. And he knows, in his heart, he must pay.♤ Doesn’t he, Stanley?
Maybe you’re right. Maybe he could change. Maybe he’s not damaged beyond repair. Maybe he could make amends to all those that he’s hurt so terribly. Or maybe not. [ Red dumps The Stewmaker into the bubbling acid bath as Liz listens, a horrified look on her face ]
We’ve had a little incident. Agent Keen needs medical attention.
That’s a pretty blouse.
Here. [ Hands Liz the Stewmaker’s book of photos ] It’s horrifying. But at least you can give peace of mind to some of the families.
You gonna tell on me, Lizzy? Tell Harold how bad I’ve been?
Yes.
By saving your life.
The book I just gave agent Keen should help to put Lorca or many of his kind away for a nice long time.
Cost of doing business.
He is on my jet.
Have it intercepted.
I’m well aware of the men and resources we lost in Cairo. Perhaps this is an opportunity to let our new friends at the FBI carry the water.
Something of a hideaway. It used to be home to one of the finest American writers who ever lived – Fredrick Hemstead.
No, you haven’t. Nobody has. Dear Fredrick was waiting tables when we first met. Strange little man, built like a fireplug. He was living here with his mother until she died. Poor Fredrick couldn’t afford to stay on, so I bought the place for him.
Sadly, Fredrick died without ever being published, but this place is chock-full of his work Manuscripts, poems, unsent letters, and lots and lots of this.
No earthly idea. Some sort of distilled alcohol, I think. There’s bottles of the stuff stashed everywhere. Would you like me to pour you a few fingers?
Have you ever wondered how criminals who know they can’t trust one another are still able to conduct business with each other?
The next target on the blacklist is a physical embodiment of both. He’s known as the Courier, and his involvement in a transaction virtually guarantees success. Once he’s hired to make a delivery, he can’t be bribed, he can’t be stopped. If either a party attempts to double–cross the other, he kills them both. The perfect middleman for an imperfect world.
He will when you tell him the Courier is scheduled to deliver a package worth $20 million. At that price, it could be anything from a genetically engineered virus to a very important person’s head in a bag.
I’m sure he does. I don’t know it.
I know the man he’s planning on delivering the package to. An Iranian spy named Hamid Soroush.
At the Winston farmer’s market in 2 hours and 45 minutes.
I don’t know, Harold. Might it be conceivable your people actually missed something?
Let me put your mind at ease. I’m never telling you everything.♤ I did my job here. I gave you a Blacklister.spd There he sits.
Obviously, he spotted one of your agents, and poor Soroush paid the price.
That’s interesting. I always wondered if the stories were true. I think you may need to call a doctor.
This is hilarious. Fredrick wrote to the editor of the Washington Post almost every day thank you about any and every subject. Listen to this one. “Dear Mr. Bradley, what is up with all the rabbits – ”
And what do I get in return?
Tell me what you’ve learned about your husband.
Of whom?
I imagine you’ve found ways around that particular obstacle.
You lived in New York at the time. Why would you think your husband would be in Boston?
A few years ago, some of my associates encountered the Courier in an opium den in Cairo. He killed two of them. If he still has a taste for the poppy, there’s a man who may be able to help us.
I’m talking about a friend a philosopher who practices an ancient ritual going back thousands of years. There’s a good chance he could be helpful in locating the Courier’s safe house.
Thank you.
For being honest with me. In my life, I don’t encounter that frequently.
You’re here because somebody screwed up.
Her name’s Laurence Dechambou. She’s ex-French intelligence. She now makes a handsome living selling secrets, mostly of a technological nature. I really don’t understand any of it. But she’s clearly stepping up on this one, trying to make a legacy for herself. She owns that nightclub. Last time I was there, we had a great deal of fun, until she tried to strangle me with her stocking.
She won’t talk, and even if she did, what would you expect her to say?
She won’t.
This is a bad idea, Harold.
And why would she tell you that, again?
If you really want her to talk, I should meet with her.
We’ve gotten off to a rocky start.
I’m not perfect.♤
Or just bend over any available piece of furniture and let her slap you on the ass. She loves that.♤
I have a better suggestion. Let her go.
God, are you FBI. When this woman was working for French intelligence, she was on track to be you, Harold. Since she’s come over to my side, she’s only gone up from there. You really think you’re gonna be able to prove anything against her?
You don’t have any time. Pick her up in a week, in a month next time. But right now, if you want to save that man’s life, you need to release Dechambou. I’ll make her talk.
You don’t want me to answer that.
You don’t. But I don’t see that you have many other options left.
I’ll consider it a bonus. Better make it a double.
Oh, we’ll always have Paris.
So many things. But right now, I want some information. Where is the NSA agent?
Yes. And he’s been compromised. Who do you think he’ll blame for that?
Laurence, the Iranian is dead, and you’re next. You know that.
The world is rarely a fair place. That’s why it needs people like me.♤ I’ll get you out of the country and guarantee your safety. There’s a private jet awaiting your arrival right now. In exchange, you give me the location where you dropped the kid off last night.
That $20 million is about to die. This is not a negotiation.
Oh, he knows you. He knows where you live, where you work, where you play. He knows you better than I do, and I know where that lovely little freckle is.♤ I give you a day and a half before he finds you. Try to be brave.
At 4:00 a.m., Dechambou left Seth in the back of a pickup truck at this rest stop in Manassas.
This entire area’s inaccessible.
How much air does he have left?
With Dembe driving, we might make it just in time to see him die. If we find our NSA friend and he’s still alive, he might prove helpful.
So should you.
He’s in the dirt.
The refrigerator. It’s a coffin. The Courier buries things under his skin. He’s in the dirt right here.
I died once in Marrakech  Two and a half minutes. You wouldn’t believe what I saw on the other side.
The FBI – and friends.
I’m sure we’ll think of something.
What? The boy wishes to express gratitude. I’m merely playing my part in the ritual.
He did.
Yes.
Not “wasted,” my friend. Circumstances are far more complex than we ever imagined. I’m betting on the long play  The future.
Funny all these wonderful manuscripts, and my favorite thing about this place is still the view from the sofa. I love how the light breaks through the trees.
I’m looking at it right now. It’s beautiful. What? Oh, the blues? Well, the blues look –
– green and gray, the gaping maw of the ocean. It’s mesmerizing. I don’t know why the hell I’m doing this. This painting should be hanging in Boston.[ Laughing ] No, I know. [ Cellphone vibrating ] My man in the port of Dubai says payment was sent last week. The painting will be in hand well before the wedding. Yes. Hakim, remember me to your wives. All of them.
What is it?
People think it matters who occupies that house. It doesn’t. Multinational corporations and criminals run the world. ♤
You’ve obviously heard of corporate espionage –  companies trying to beat other companies to be the first hand on the dollar. But what if it were taken a few steps further? In 1982, seven people in Chicago were killed by an over–the–counter drug laced with potassium cyanide. The company’s market share went from 35 to 8. It was never determined how the drug was poisoned, but I will tell you someone was hired to do that. Remember those tire recalls, Chernobyl? Deliberate and malevolent actions taken by corporations to protect their vital interests. Nothing happens by chance. That’s why I’m here, Lizzy. Because there’s a woman Gina Zanetakos.
Gina Zanetakos is a corporate terrorist And frankly, she’s the best of the bunch. Lizzy, if you want to find the truth about your husband, then you need to find Gina.
Because she’s Tom’s lover.♤
I fail to see how suspicions about her husband affect our arrangement.
Well, then, lives will be lost. What if I were to deliver to you a terrorist, not your run–of–the–mill ideologue answering to bearded men in caves, but someone entirely different less predictable and far more dangerous.
My job is my business, Harold. Delivering criminals to you is a hobby, a diversion♤, one that may become tiresome, in which case we could always reminisce about that unfortunate incident in Kuwait.❗
I am. Hardly the time to let morals stand in the way of your upward mobility, Agent Cooper.
Why would she want to do that, Lizzy?
Have you found the connection to your husband?
Perhaps they exchanged letters.
You can trust me.
No. Hakim, that is not the problem. Listen to me. Shipping is my business. Once I receive payment, the merchandise ships. That’s the deal. According to my man in Houston, the payment’s not there. It’s been diverted to New Orleans, which is entirely unacceptable. Well, I don’t care if the wedding is Saturday. All I care about is my payment. Hakim, this conversation is over. Hello, Lizzy. What can I do for you? [ Laughs ] Maxwell Ruddiger. Tremendous bomb maker. Haphazard as hell, terrible drinker, but he gets the job done.
So he’s the link. Ruddiger can get you to Zanetakos, and she’ll get you to Tom.
I hear you’re using Cobalt 60 in the device, and you know as well as I there’s only one reputable supplier on the market, and that’s our friend Yuri. Now, I like Yuri. I floated in the Dead Sea with Yuri, climbed Masada with his wife. But if your device goes off, they’ll be looking to him. And if they look to him they’ll look to me. [ Glasses clink ] Because Yuri talks faster than a cheerleader after a nooner under the grandstands. Probably not a metaphor you understand.
That’s unfortunate. I’m in the middle of negotiating something very interesting, something unique in Syria. I’ll be playing all sides. Ah, I thought there might be a place for you at the table. Another day.
When will it detonate?
Then we’ll have to ask Gina. Call her. I just need to know where she is. This will never come back on you. 
[ Laughs ] Quite a lot. What do you have in mind?
Yes.
It happens every once in a while, but this was unprecedented. An associate of mine in New Orleans was advising illicit traffic in the Gulf to be rerouted to New Orleans.
They’re a majority owner of a port in New Orleans.
Houston.
That’s my girl. [ Tosses phone to Dembe ]
Please do come in.
I heard about Tom.
Or took the fall.
I can only lead you to the truth. I can’t make you believe it.
No.
Is that what Tom said?
Agent Keen, I have a tip. You’re a winter, not an autumn. Stop wearing olive.♤
You’re not the one who had to listen to that God–awful hold music for 7 minutes, which wouldn’t have been necessary if you’d take my calls. It’s a little snug. Don’t you think, Martin? [ Red is being measured for a suit ]
This isn’t a social call. I can identify the man you’re looking for, Lizzy.
Phones are so impersonal. Why don’t we meet for show and tell in 30 minutes? Dembe will forward you a location. If you care to hear me out, wonderful. Otherwise, good luck with your case.
The man you’re looking for is named Frederick Barnes, a former defense research scientist out of ARPAX Systems in Annapolis. You may not be familiar with his name, but you’re likely familiar with his work [in] biochemical agents such as cytochlorin, black phosphorus, paratoxin. Barnes headed the project team that developed all of them. But he was more than just a research scientist. He was gifted, a savant of government–sanctioned mass killing.
Five years ago, the man quit his job, sold his house, and entered the free market. Started selling his creations to the highest bidder autocrats, terrorists, me.
Where have I heard that before? You want to compare him to me? Be my guest. I’m perfectly comfortable with what I am.♤ But, please, make no mistake – Frederick Barnes is a very special animal, one with the tools and know-how to kill thousands and thousands of people all at once. What he’s lacked until now has been the desire.
Well, that’s the question. Barnes has always operated with a certain level of detachment – always the designer, the seller, never the delivery agent of his own weapons. But if Barnes is now willing to use his work to kill indiscriminately, then he is, quite literally, the most dangerous man in the world.
Strontium 90 isn’t something you can just pick up at your local piggly wiggly. It’s a waste by–product of nuclear reactors: toxic, highly regulated. There’s only a handful of people in the world who can procure it in sizable quantities.
Actually, I happen to know three of them the first of whom was apprehended by Russian authorities last month, the second, vaporized by a drone in Quetta, courtesy of your colleagues in the five–sided foxhole.
Is likely Barnes’ supplier.
I’m afraid it wouldn’t do you any good. The FBI has no jurisdiction where he operates. In any case, I’ve already set a meeting with him for this afternoon.
He knows how to get paid by him. That should be sufficient.
We’ll cross that bridge when we get there, Donald. Look, we’re wasting precious time. You want to catch a mass murderer before he strikes again, and for that to happen, I need to catch a plane. You should come, Lizzy. We could have a therapy session on the way, talk out our problems. Have you ever been to Cuba?
You’d look positively radiant in a Guayabera dress. I know a little shop in Reston. We could stop before our flight.
You have something more pressing than finding your suspect?
So, I guess you’re on your own. I’m sorry you’re upset with me.
I might do the same in your position. It’s easier to blame me for framing your husband than face the truth of what he is.
Oh, that’s not the end of the story. I’m confident you’ll come to see that. But in the meantime, we need to find a way to move past this. Because for me, there’s just no fun in it unless you’re there. And if there’s no fun to be had, I’m not interested.♤
[ Leans his head against Luli’s shoulder ] Quick, say something nice to me. It’s been a dreadful morning.
Is it really for sale – ?
Hmm.
Perhaps this day can be salvaged after all.
Buenas tardes, Maria Rosa! Buenas tardes! Qué tal? Ahh, gracias. Mmm. Gracias. Manny, as always, you look like hell.
Come here.
Just you, Manny. It’s all you. Let’s talk about Strontium 90.
A Qassam rocket is a fertilizer–filled trash can. I wouldn’t fire that eyesore at my worst enemy.
I need it now.
Then perhaps I could get in touch with your previous buyer and make them an offer instead.
What, are they gonna pull their guns and hold them all sideways at me?  Manny, I’m sure we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
Reach out to your buyer, convince them to sell back some of their purchase to you at a premium.
My client will put up $10 million for immediate delivery, with a hefty transaction fee for yourself, of course.
Like a trout to a butterworm.♤  He should be calling Barnes any minute.
Good, run the trace.
A bottle of beer and a pork sandwich. How about you? What do you need? How about Barnes’ location? 
Either you accidentally dialed the wrong number. Or you’re calling because you’ve hit a dead end. So, which is it?
You g-men are top shelf. Let me guess. Ressler slipped on a banana peel?
I’m not a gumball machine, Lizzy. You don’t get to just twist the handle whenever you want a treat.♤ We can’t keep doing this little waltz.
I’m listening.
Ah, music to my ears. What was that last part again?♤
All you had to do was ask. I saw in the coverage there was a survivor from the Arlington attack. You should assume Barnes knows that, as well.
Has he been to see her yet?
Are you sure?
Barnes may be a scientist, but he’s also a killer. And in that line of work, a survivor is considered unfinished business.
I brought you a souvenir. What’s your feeling about guava?
Oh, you’re in for a treat. I take it from the coroner’s van that Barnes is no longer with us. Pity.
Every cause has more than one effect. Say what you will about Frederick, but someone who’s willing to burn the world down to protect the one person they care about – That’s a man I understand.♤
Aren’t you presumptuous?♤
Maybe not.
You know the problem with drawing lines in the sand? With a breath of air, they disappear.♤ You may not like me. You may not understand how or why I do what I do. But I’m here because you want answers to questions you haven’t even thought of yet.♤ Now, if that doesn’t matter to you, the solution is simple I get in this car and I disappear.
I offer that particular package to clients.
I’m not going to beg you to allow me the privilege of helping you. So, say the word, and I’m gone. Tell me to go, Lizzy…. Then I guess I’ll see you tomorrow.
Strange. I remember it being bigger.
I raised my family in this house.♤
No, it’s not, but it used to be. [ looking out the window, a vision of dark–haired girl 4–6 twirling around in the yard making super–bubbles ]
[To Dembe:] Did you prepare everything the way I asked?
I spend every day trying to forget what happened here.♤ This should help. [ They get in car and begin to drive away. The 💥 house explodes 💥 ]
Then you’ll just have to find another criminal to talk to Elizabeth Keen and make fun of Agent Ressler.♤
Yes, the agreement is for me to bring cases to you. It doesn’t work the other way around. I’m not your consultant. I have no interest in cases that I have no interest in. Personally, I think my proposal was incredibly fair. You have got to give to get, Harold.
If you want me to help you with this case, I will, but I need something extra to sweeten the deal. Rest assured, granting me access to ViCAP will benefit you just as much as it does me.
You’re speaking as if an individual is responsible for this. It’s far bigger than you might think. It’s a movement. Do we have a deal? 
 I find it so reassuring the movie stars, the pop singers they really are just like the rest of us.
Mary, darling, you would thrive in Malaysia, and Caleb would love it. Those thieving little monkeys near Batu Caves are absolute rascals. Molly! [ To Liz: ] What are you doing here? You’re a little early. We’re not ready yet. One of our most trusted couriers. Please excuse us.
Mary is an artist. She has a tremendous gift.♤
Luli didn’t pick up because we are busy.
Well, you’re here now, so what’s on your mind?
I never tire of being correct.
I understand your father is not well.
The cancer. It’s come back?
You should be there with him.
Dr. Maltz.
Abraham Maltz. The best surgeon for this sort of business. Maltz. Before we do this, let me be clear I have business that requires further travel today, so this needs to happen quickly. You need to follow my lead. Dr. Maltz is not on the blacklist. He’s an asset I need to protect.
Abraham.
I don’t know how you do it. I had that done once. I couldn’t bear the tickling. How are you? We need to talk, in private.
Beets, mostly. Some celery, carrots, a lot of ginger. The kale makes me dyspeptic.
So, Nathaniel Wolff – you gave him a new face. I need to find him.
I do, and I thank you for that, Abraham. Normally, I wouldn’t impose, but this is a personal matter of some urgency.
Absolutely.
Abraham! I refer important clients to you, people who are vital to my business, people whose livelihood depends on your confidentiality, and you roll over like a cockapoo wanting his belly scratched?
Some woman who claims to be an FBI agent makes a few ham-fisted threats, and you hand over one of your own clients? That’s dirty pool. God forbid this little incident ever gets back to poor Nathaniel Wolff.
What other secrets have you just given away?
Who knows about the work I’ve had done?
I brought Christina to you specifically for your discretion and expertise. I assured her you were trustworthy.
I was wrong. Shame on you, Abraham. I know another doctor. Let’s go.
Hello, Sam. It’s been far too long.
Oh, my God. I’ve never been more scared of a woman in my life. She was thrilling in bed. What a pair of legs. I think she played field hockey in college. I’ve missed that laugh. [ Red tales Sam’s hand ] You look like hell.
I finally had a chance to see her, Sam. There’s a fire inside she got from you. She’s volatile. Unpredictable. Soft then hard then – Soft again. Stronger than she knows. You gave her an incredible gift, Sam. Taking her in and loving her as your own.
Mm.
No.
I can’t let you do that.
Thank you. You will always be her father, Sam. I can only hope to love her and protect her as you have.♤
Lizzy, how are you?
Sorry. I was just thinking about you and wanted to see if you needed anything.
No. With your father. Are you gonna make it home to Nebraska?
Not mine. Lizzy, are you sure there’s nothing I can do for you?
Mind if I sit?
A friend. He died today.
Yourself?
Oh, my. I’m terribly sorry. It’s hard to not say goodbye. I have lost so many people. Never seems to get any easier.
Yes. It’ll undoubtedly take some time. But I’m sure she’ll be fine. He’ll always be there with her, standing in the shadows to keep her safe, laughing with her in the light, watching through her eyes all those who get close. He’ll always be there. She will be fine.♤
I know I am.
Lizzy.
If you know what corners to cut, yes, everything is possible.
My guess is you’re half right.
Where was Wolff last seen?
How fitting. Let me look into the matter. I’ll see what I can find. Dembe, tell Edward we’re making an unscheduled stop.
Oh, I’m not your pilot. He went for a stroll.
Years ago, I used to smuggle small shipments of oaxaca-highland gold into this airstrip. Beautiful space. Bumpy as hell. You know, Mr. Wolff, I admire your commitment. Others may doubt you, may think your revolutionary talk is just that talk to cover your grief but I think not. You really do want this country’s financial system to fail. And if I’m not mistaken, you’ve come up with an ingenious way to make that happen.
No doubt, the feds are congratulating themselves this very minute for recovering the blueprint they assume is real, but you and I know it’s not. It’s a fake.
You swapped the drives, gave the feds a counterfeit. If the mint uses it, billions of dollars of counterfeit currency will be circulated, bankrupting this country.
I’m gonna rob you. Because unlike you, I happen to believe in capitalism. I like money. I like the lifestyle it affords me. I like the things that happen when you give it away.♤ What becomes of you and General Ludd once you board that plane is none of my concern though it is worth noting that a true luddite would burn the plane rather than fly in it. But whatever. Your irony. At any rate, have a safe flight. And buckle up. This runway is a bitch.
Send it to Agent Keen.
[ Pause ] I’m sorry about your father. How was the funeral?  This is going to be a difficult time. The best way to keep the memory of your father alive is to talk about him. Tell me some stories.
In memory of the not–so–dearly departed Herr Spielman…
…who undercut and robbed you on the supply routes through Graz, I’ll double what he was spending and handle the packaging and transit myself.
Donald! There you are. I told you I’d pick you up at the airport.
The cab ride must have cost you a fortune. Guten tag, alles. Oh, is this Donald is my man at the State Department. He’s been extremely helpful in all our endeavors here. But the poor fellow has to walk a terrible tightrope every single day. I feel obliged to get him drunk once in a while, –  so I invited him down to celebrate.
Free trade, Donald. Free trade. Freihandel. Honestly, this damn chip. What the hell do you want?
Then why isn’t she here?
You made the trip.
By whom?
No, you said she’s been detained. Is she in danger?
My plane’s faster.
Donald, what the hell are you doing?
Where’s Agent Keen?
I must be.
Why am I in handcuffs, Harold? You’re violating our arrangement.
That condition is a constant.
Hilton Wells?
You obviously don’t. Hilton Wells doesn’t speak with the Egyptians. He hasn’t since he aligned himself with Mubarak during the Arab Spring.
With all due respect, if the intel were worth having, then I would have it.
There’s a running price on my head, Agent Ressler.
Listen to me. If this intel was disseminated, it was done so directly to you. It’s canned, which means Anslo Garrick intends to attack this facility.
What do I think? I think we have a songbird in our midst, and until I find out who’s singing, I don’t trust anyone because someone helped to bring him here.
Because I’m asymmetrical. I don’t need visas, passports, travel documents. Give me a bug-out bag and 30 seconds, and I’m on my way to anywhere in the world. Garrick knows this. He needs me contained, landlocked. So he fed you phony intel to trigger your security protocol and now you’ve done exactly as he wished. He got you to bring me here so that he could attack this facility.
All he does is extract people from places that don’t exist, places exactly like this. Garrick exfils high-level detainees always by considerable force.
He liberated Mahmoud Al Azok from an Alcatraz–like CIA black site in the Bering Sea.
No. That was Garrick, paid by that same Peruvian money launderer to make it appear as though Shining Path broke him out. It was Garrick.
He almost exclusively works with a group of heavily armed, highly skilled mercenaries who call themselves The  Wild Bunch – former flag wavers made over in Frankenstein–like fashion into bloodless, country-less killers. Garrick is not a precision instrument. He’s a blunt-force object and seemingly immune to bullets. I can attest to this first-hand having put one in his head years ago at point-blank range. Harold, this building is about to be breached.
They’re in.
Get me out of these damn cuffs.
Neutralized? Harold, do not make a stand. Get your people the hell out of here.
I don’t think you appreciate the sheer firepower – that has entered this building.
He means to take me, Agent Ressler, and kill anyone in his way or in his wake. This isn’t about digging in. This is about escape.
Why not let them have me, Donald? I’ll likely be tortured for weeks and left to rot until they finally deign to put a bullet in my skull. Wouldn’t that please you?
Donald, you and I aren’t done just yet.
We’re going up.
What are you feeling in your extremities? – What do you feel?
Shock is setting in.
More than a thimbleful.
Lay down. Lay down. Donald, never let it be said that I valued a Zegna Venticinque tie over a human life, even yours. Take up a handful of your own tie. This is gonna be hugely unpleasant and very painful. Bite down. All right?
Keep pressure on it. Just keep pressure on it.
You know, Anslo, I’m looking at you, and I got to say I’m really surprised. With the access you now have to top-notch plastic surgeons, why you haven’t done something anything about that horrific scar. I mean, how do you wake up to that staring back at you in the mirror every morning? But you know what? It’s not the scar. It’s really the eye. But, hey, lucky you. I normally carried Hydra-Shok hollow points. I was trying out a new series of center-fire wadcutters that week. It’s probably the only thing that saved your life, really – Me switching ammo. Think about that little irony now every time you randomly find your reflection or are reminded of that unfortunate thing I’ve done to your face. Think about it.
We were never partners, Anslo. You violated whatever trust I had in you. So, naturally, I did what I always did – And beat you. And you did what you always did – Got beaten by me. True to form, Anslo. Why take time to think when it’s so much easier to shoot? This glass was developed by DARPA for secure cover and housing in combat zones. That .45 might as well be a spit straw.
Donald, I’m gonna quietly cross my fingers before I ask, but what blood type are you?
And you thought we had nothing in common. There’s only 2% of us, you know?
You need a blood transfusion. Or we’re gonna have to open that door, which will likely be the end of both of us.
The concept of a last stand sounds so heroically romantic, doesn’t it, Donald? But there’s a good reason why we didn’t see what happened to Butch and Sundance. Being riddled by bullets and left to rot under a scorching Bolivian sky does not a sequel make. And if you’ve surmised nothing about me by now, know this. I’m gonna be around for the sequel.
Oh, come now, Donald. Think how much smarter you’ll be afterwards.
I knew about Brussels.
Because that’s what you do when someone is dying in front of you.♤ Allies today, enemies tomorrow The world is a complex place, further complicated by man’s fickle nature. Years ago, I saved a man’s life under a beautiful old cedar tree in Lebanon. A month later, he tried to kill me in a hotel in Damascus. I understood. Allegiances shift. A month later I broke his neck with a shower caddy. It’s this job today, another one tomorrow. That needle in your arm becomes the one in your neck. It’s just that fast.♤
Yes, Anslo. Is that what you’re doing out there? Is this to be mass suicide by explosion, I hope?
Donald! Donald! Feeling any wittier yet? Any strange cravings for Beluga caviar or Marcel Proust?
May I ask you something with the hope that you won’t take offense?
What happened to Audrey Bidwell?
You were engaged.
I know a great many things about you, Donald.
We become who we are. We can’t judge a book by its cover But you can by its first few chapters and, most certainly, by its last.♤
Oh, revenge is too easy and over so quickly. I would hope for more than that.
I think we will.
Have you ever sailed across an ocean, Donald?
On a sailboat surrounded by sea with no land in sight? Without even the possibility of sighting land for days to come? To stand at the helm of your destiny. I want that one more time. I want to be in the Piazza del Campo in Sienna, to feel the surge as …  I want another meal in Paris at L’Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges. I want another bottle of wine. And then another.
I want the warmth of a woman in a cool set of sheets. One more night of jazz at the Vanguard. I want to stand on summits and smoke Cubans and feel the sun on my face for as long as I can. Walk on the wall again. Climb the tower. Ride the river. Stare at the frescos. I want to sit in the garden and read one more good book. Most of all, I want to sleep. I want to sleep like I slept when I was a boy.♤ Give me that. Just one time. That’s why I won’t allow that punk out there to get the best of me, let alone the last of me.
There you go again, Anslo, using a pistol in place of a brain. You gonna put a bullet in the head of the man who can hand you mine?
Hardly. I have little to no use for that man. But before you shoot him, be absolutely certain that I’m not outsmarting you. We know how frequently that’s happened in the past. It would be a shame if in killing him you denied yourself of the prize that you came here for. Anslo! How long do you think you can hold out here before half of Quantico’s graduating class rappels down on top of you?
Your heart is pumping harder and harder, trying to compensate for blood loss. And that shotgun blast broke your leg. I think it also partially ruptured your femoral artery.
You would have bled out by now if the hole were any bigger, but now I have to close it.
By cauterizing it. I’m gonna have to cut open your leg to get at the artery and then sprinkle some combustible compound on it – and ignite it.
Donald, if you don’t tell them how to open that door, I have to do this, or you will die.
Grab ahold of the bench back there and don’t let go. I’m gonna cut as fast as I can, but I can’t have you trying to stop me once I start, okay?
This is gonna hurt.
Hold still, Donald. This will be over in a second.
Harold! Open the box now!
Give him the code!
Anslo, my people can help you.
Cooper can get you in here.
Put that gun to his head.
For once in your life, stop and think
Harold, tell him. Wait. Ressler knows the code.
Ressler. Ressler!
Ressler! Ressler!
Harold, open this box. I’ll give you anything.
Open the box! 
Anslo Garrick got you to bring me here so that he could attack this facility.
Neutralized? Harold, do not make a stand. He means to take me, Agent Ressler, and kill anyone in his way or in his wake.
Wait!
Ressler! [ Slaps him. No response. Squeezes his wound ] –
Look at me. I need you to focus. I need the code.
To open the box.
Tell me the code now.
Circumstances have changed, Donald. If you can’t save her, you’re of no use whatsoever. Look at me. Look at me! Agent Keen will die. Now is the time!
R–O–M–E–O Romeo. [ Red smiles a painful smile at  Liz ]
Anslo, what are you doing here? 
Let them go, Anslo.
There’s enough blood on the floor. It’s time to get the hell out of here.
Simpler days, Anslo. Simpler days.
She doesn’t do anything for you, Anslo. She’s dead weight.
[ To Liz ]The Emissary Hotel in Chicago. Mr. Kaplan.
You’re greedy, Anslo. You went behind my back, made deals you knew I wouldn’t approve. What did you expect?
Then do it.
Please.
We do.
Nothing has changed.
No.
Nothing.
My reasons have n- nothing to do with you.
Oh, give it a rest. We both know Fitch won’t let you finish it.
Regret.
Lizzy. Red.
Gone for a short while.
Dembe will have to wait. Lizzy I want you to know, wherever I am, whatever I’m doing, if you are in need, I will be there.
I have to go.
What is the question, Lizzy?
[ Long pause ] No.
Lizzy be careful of your husband.
Anslo Garrick got you to bring me here so that he could attack this facility.
Nothing.
Arrange transport of her ashes personally. I want it done properly.
I want you to tell me about your friend – the man with the apple.
How did you communicate?
Tell me about these jobs.
Who told you you had four minutes?
How were you paid?
Where?
So, you had no knowledge of either the location or a target?
How were you paid?
What denomination were the bills?
I know you have. You have such a pretty face. And a paramedic. What a shame.
Lizzy.
I read about that poor woman they found in Albany. Sounded awfully familiar.
Are you back on the case, I hope?
This one’s important to you, isn’t he? Why? What on Earth happened?  I only ask on the chance that I may be able to help.
You missed something, didn’t you?
I don’t know about serial killers, but I do know about torture, and there is no one–size–fits–all. If you really want to hurt someone, you need to tailor your attack specifically to that person. Perhaps the killer’s methods, the injuries he inflicts tell you less about him and more about his victims. I got to go.
Hello, Fyodor.
Oh, yes, Fyodor. We’re gonna talk, all right.
Honestly, I don’t understand you, Fyodor. With all the business you do, and you’re still funneling the money through your nightclubs, paying contracts in 5s and 10s ’cause you’re too cheap to pay the commission for clean cash. Anyway, I get sidetracked. I’ve come for your banker. Who is the banker?
The first time I ever smoked a cigar was with Marnie Petersen in fifth grade. Funny, little, bat–faced girl. I adored her. The bank.
How about I make this as simple as possible? There are five bankers on the East Coast who were capable of financing a mission like Garrick’s. I run money through four of them.
Thank you.
Yes, we’re finished.
Oh, my God. The suspense is killing me. [ Red shoots Fyodor in the heart, turns and leaves ]
Henry.
Great. I’d love to meet the wife.
There’s been a nasty bit of business – blood spilled, lives lost. A modicum of torture words don’t fully describe. I know who’s responsible. I know who carried it out.
I’ve tied up all the loose ends but one. To finish the job, I’ll need all your wire and transfer records pertaining to the operation.
Please, Henry. Stop. You were the bank. Henry. You were the bank.
You’ll hear from me tomorrow.
Hello, Aram.
You’re going to do something for me. Account numbers, routing information. You’re going to steal $5 million from that account and place it into one of mine. I expect the transaction to be untraceable.
Aram this is a Colt .45 1911. I can strip and reassemble this weapon – in well under two minutes.
Once I have it reassembled, I’m gonna reload the mag, and if at that time, your task remains incomplete, I’m gonna empty that mag into your head.
Don’t look so stricken. The first shot will kill you.♤
How? Explain.
A souvenir. You’re innocent.
The team that broke into the black site was paid through Gestalten Landesbank. My contact there traced a $250,000 payment to a covert account belonging to Louis Coogan.
It’s an alias, for you. Someone is attempting to implicate you as a mole by creating a money trail that leads directly to you. You’re obviously far too clever to have accepted payment that was so easily traceable.
No. I’m going to find somebody else, and I’m going to kill them.♤ 
You never told me you rowed crew for Dartmouth. Don’t worry, Henry. I haven’t told her all our war stories. Well, a few. You have a lovely wife. We’ve been getting to know each other. Come here, you old such and such. [ Big hug. Whispers in his ear: ] I know what you’ve done.
I hope you don’t mind if I stay. I do love Stroganoff.
[ To Janice ] You’re fun.
Whichever is quicker.
No, Henry. You gave me the bank transfers pointing to a patsy.
Nearly everyone has been accounted for, except one. Who else got paid?
Who else got paid?
Please, Janice. Stop with the yelling. It’s just a flesh wound.
The next bullet goes in your stomach if you don’t start talking. I want a name.
Janice, if you don’t stop, – I’m gonna put you in the closet.
Henry, give me the name.
Janice if you don’t stop your yammering, I’m gonna have to shoot through this door, which will be a shame, because I won’t have any idea what I’m shooting at.  Give me a name, Henry, or I’m gonna drag you out, throw you in the trunk, fly you to Papua New Guinea, and have your head stuck on a pole.
Janice, my sincerest apologies. I’ll take a rain check on the Stroganoff. It smells delicious.
Newton.
If you had come to me, I could have helped you. We could have avoided all of this. But now we can’t.
Of course they did. Newton, I’ll take care of your family, whatever they need.
Look out at the water. Just look out at the water.
Tom’s at the airport.
How did things go with your case? Congratulations. I’m proud of you.
I don’t know. My house is clean. But yours is not.
The deficit that I found in my organization could not have supplied all the knowledge required for the incursion to take place. That would have been supplied by someone with far greater access.
It would seem so.
Me speaking with you.
Out and about.
Yes. The next name on the blacklist.
omeone with far greater access supplied all the knowledge required for the incursion to take place.
My house is clean. But yours is not.
Yes. The next name on the blacklist – 
– There’s someone I think you should find. He’s a man who protects the guilty by preying on the innocent. He’s killed women, children, infants if need be– whatever the particular job calls for. I bring this to your attention because I’ve learned that he’s been contracted to protect Pytor Madrczyk and his wife.
The same.
They call him the Alchemist.
Because he relies upon science to transform one person into another.
You’re burying the lead, Borakove.
There he is. We brought a little something for Julian –  a care package. It’s a Tibetan singing bowl. What do we have here?  Some jackfruit, vitamin D, kola nuts. But we’ve got to get him to eat more protein. He looks like hell. He isn’t vegan, is he? Anyway, I’ve also included a couple of my favorite Richard Pryor records. I want to try and inject a little levity into the proceedings. I mean, Julian looks so crabby all the time. House arrest can be grueling.
Seven.
Naps. Occasional calisthenics. So, the defense fund – where do we stand?
He’s been holed up at that embassy for, what, two years now? It could go on forever and cost a fortune. I’m practically bankrolling the entire defense fund as it is. For that, I need best efforts. Surely, there’s some stone you’ve left unturned.
Put it together.
Borakove, I hate sarcasm, and I love puzzles.
You were – by my people.
Yes. It’s a sanctuary. And until the deficit in your organization is found, I’m keeping a low profile.
Pytor Madrczyk is alive.
Your medical examiner has it wrong.
Yes.
Well, the Alchemist can. Lizzy, this man is a forensic virtuoso. He’s an artist who paints in blood and saliva samples. Human tissue is his canvas. I’m not ashamed to say he’s even better than me at helping people disappear, which is why Madrczyk hired him and not myself.
Competition is fierce.
If I tell you, you have to promise me you’ll try the fertilized duck eggs. It’s a daring and unique dining experience. You’ll think you’ve died and gone to hell.
I don’t know even half of it. I’ve heard rumors– removing the white blood cells from the victim and replacing them with the red blood cells of his client, leaving clone DNA at crime scenes to mislead the police, even incorporating synthetic DNA into genuine human tissue.
Yes. It’s a trade in death. The guilty give their blood and genetic identity.mThe innocent give their life for the guilty to live. If you find the Alchemist, you have a chance to resurrect the dead, to bring to justice some of the most vile creatures who ever lived. 
Ah, the Germans. Despite the headlines, they’re still the best at keeping an eye on their fellow man.
You see, Borakove? You do have a head underneath all that hair. Forget Julian and his defense fund. We have a bright future right–  Lizzy, come look at this. The boys have come up with a remarkable little game. I really don’t understand how any of it works, but I just love that smell the machines make.
Yours. Shredded communications from private contractors working with the DOJ, NSA, CIA, FBI – all the initials.
Perhaps. Could be the combination to his gym locker. What do you know about the man specifically? What is it that makes him unique?
That’s what he does. Who is he?
Blow it up. [ Strips of document, but name of “Meera Malik” is clear ]
Attractive but treacherous.
Excellent. Print me a copy.
Just out of curiosity, – what number am I on your speed dial?
Who’s six?
Tell me what you know.
You don’t have time for that. Go back to the wife and daughter. He’s not alone anymore. You have to look to their lives in order to find him. They’re the ones that matter. They are his vulnerability.
There you are.
The Alchemist– you found him?
I have other business.
I’d love to talk, Lizzy, but as I said, I have unfinished business to attend to.
Hello, Meera. I trust you know why I’m here.
There’s nothing more profound and of lasting consequence than the decision to have a child. The exploitation and perversion of that decision is the stock and trade of a truly evil organization – the Cyprus Adoption Agency.
Life is full of lovely little ironies. The Cyprus Agency offers a promise of something very special– perfection. Their clients are ordering from an unlimited genetic menu, the characteristics of the child they want to bring home. But the evil is not in what the agency offers. It’s in how they get it done.
The Cyprus Agency is in the abduction business. They don’t locate kids for adoption. They steal them and adopt them out to new parents. And moving stolen children is difficult. There’s copious amounts of paperwork. They’re using a forger. One of the best. But I’m biased. He’s one of my best. Lizzy, I’m giving you the chance to take down a criminal organization that is abducting babies from their mothers’ arms. This is the next child the Cyprus Agency will deliver, a boy, less than two weeks from now.
I have no idea. But he’s about to become the child of David and Wendy Roland.
That’s why you’re here, Mr. Brimley.
Thank you, Teddy.
[ Door creaks ] [ Sighs ] Let’s talk.
Yes, but now that you’ve been vetted by Mr. Brimley, I’m more inclined to listen. Like I said, to get into the blacksite so quickly, Garrick had to have the site layout in advance. Which you gave to him.
I have an RFP we recovered from the trash of a government contractor, signed by Meera Malik. You leak classified data in the name of improving security.
Authorized by whom?
And why would you want to help me, Agent Malik?
The order was classified.
How’s the case coming along?
You’re so linear. [ Chuckles ]
The FBI and the police– the way they teach you to think never ceases to amaze me. Lizzy, not every missing child is on the back of a milk carton.
People who won’t or can’t go to the police. Criminals. Run the DNA again. This time, don’t look for an exact match. Look at the relatives. You want to find where those kids came from, that’s how. You’re arriving at a point of no return, Lizzy. If you have any doubts about your husband, you can’t go through with this adoption. When you get there, if there is even one shred of doubt…
Our business is done, Agent Malik.♤ 
Sorry I’m late.
Not at all what it seems.
You don’t have to. Did you know the earliest-known cul-de-sac is over 2,000 years old, unearthed in El-Lahun, Egypt? Aristotle himself was a big fan– said they made it difficult for the enemy to find their way while attacking. Now, be polite. You’re about to meet one of the nicest narcotics dealers this side of Cleveland.
Russell.
Ah. Smells delicious, Russell.
Oh, my God[ Sniffs ] If only I could do just one. No, thank you. No, last time I played around with that, I ended up naked in the desert trying to hitch a ride to Tuba City. Those Navajo tacos– Oh! Heaven! [ Chuckles ]
Uh, about two years ago
You see? I keep telling her that. She doesn’t listen to me. Listen, Russell, this isn’t a social call. I came for your professional opinion. I need to know about hydroxipam.
I don’t understand the reference.
So?
Where can I get it?
I do.
I know, Diane.
You signed a directive ordering a mandatory security upgrade at the post office. It’s how you got the blueprints into enemy hands. You’re the dirty rat, Diane.
No, you’re not.
Sit your ass down.
[ Chuckles ] You remind me of this woman I knew in Lisbon. Strange old bird.
You talk too much. [ shoots her ]
Why not? You’re not one of the good guys. And, as of today, you’re utterly worthless to the bad guys.♤ Fitch and I have an agreement. He goes about his business. I go about mine. You and I don’t have an agreement.
More than anything in the world.♤ But if you know the truth, Diane, then somebody else does, too. [ shoots her three or four more times ]
Mr. Kaplan…
…I’m sorry. It’s messier than I had hoped.
If you have any doubts about your husband, you can’t go through with this adoption, if there is even one shred of doubt.
You leak classified data in the name of improving security.
Authorized by whom?
You’re the dirty rat, Diane. …
You talk too much.
Hmm?
I was just starting to feel the endorphins vibrating in my spleen.
The key. How did you get it?
I’ve always hated Macau.
The documents in the box are worth over $10 million.
In that case, perhaps we should move to your room.
She’s breathtakingly unattractive, but she’s worth over $40 million– the only Vermeer in private hands.
Last night, I got up for a scoop of orange sherbet, and she caught my eye. I just stood here in the dark squinting at her. Poor thing ruined my appetite. Even after I went back to bed, all I could hear was the hideous music she must be playing. Didn’t sleep a wink.
Oh, my God, no. She’s not mine. She belongs to some hedge-fund manager who lives here.
Well, for now. The owner’s been on vacation ever since the SEC started its investigation. I’ve never met the man, but his housekeeper is an old friend. Please. [ Gesturing to Liz  have a seat ] Do you have any idea how much the US government has spent on signals intelligence in the past year?
Your country has become a nation of eavesdroppers– frequency domains, triangulation, satellites, crypto-whatever. You’ve forgotten that what matters most is human intelligence– alliances, relationships, seduction. Madeline Pratt is a master at…
is a thief and a woman of singular talents.
It was the right decision not to have the baby.
I’m sorry for your suffering.
Finding her is easy. Catching her is difficult. Luckily, she’s asked me to help her plan a heist.
Novak, I have friends who are looking for this funny little statue, and they’re not the least bit interested in antiquities. What is the real story?
That’s great. Harold, look at you! Sit down.
I was just looking at the pictures of Charlene and the kids. How old are they now? The kids, not Charlene.
I have no idea. And frankly, I’m flummoxed as to why you would even care.
Has Diane gone missing? Perhaps you should ask Agent Malik. She works for the woman, doesn’t she?
Well, there you go.
Who decided on this paneling?
I said nothing of the kind.
I suppose you’ll have to ask Diane Fowler when you find her.
You smell nice. Something new?
Madeline Pratt.
This is the Madeline Pratt you all know and love– politically active, influential, a good citizen. What you don’t know is the Madeline Pratt that I love. $6 million in diamonds stolen from a DeBeers outpost in the Congo. Security fibers used in printing the Czech koruna, taken from a mint in Prague and used to produce counterfeit bank notes. The Madeline Pratt you know fosters relationships with incredibly powerful people. The ones you don’t exploits those relationships in ways that impact national security.
What you do have is an opportunity, which brings us back to the Effigy of Atargatis. Madeline feels her profile is too high right now to steal it herself, so she’s asked for my help.
Secure wing in the Syrian embassy for now. But it will likely be repatriated at any moment, which means Maddie is rushed and vulnerable. She’s trying to make a grab that would normally take months to plan.
I can only assume, Harold, that Madeline has a Russian patron, since it’s the Russians who want to protect the identities of the Kungur Six.
I’m flattered that you think I’m up to it, but thieving is not my strongest suit. Luckily, we have an ace of spades among us. Isn’t that right, Agent Keen?
Nicole [Liz’s alias] here is as calm as a Hindu cow. Tell her that story about Frank.
Tell her about Omaha.
And lived happily ever after. The end.
See, this is what I love about the two of you. Headstrong, yet vulnerable. Confident, but cautious. I think you’re gonna get along great.
We have a problem. I had my people run background on the guest list for tonight’s event. The file’s on the Ottoman.Rasil Kalif– notorious playboy– works as a cultural attaché in the Syrian embassy. Apparently, Madeline’s been seeing him for some time.
Cultural attaché is Kalif’s cover. Truth is he’s been recruited as an asset by the Russian Bratva– he’s a mobster. My guess is he’s the one who hired Maddie to steal the Effigy. And right about now, she’s walking into the embassy as his date.
Well, she is.
Wow! And I like your clutch.
A tuxedo. I’m your plus one.
Oh, yes, I can. Some of my best friends are Syrian.
You have me. And I’m not gonna let anything happen to you.
Stay on task. We have two minutes to access the security door. Shall we? Lizzy, I know this must be very difficult for you, but we can’t both lead.♤
I didn’t.
Well, it was a heartwarming story. The night manager and the alley.
You’re not a cop tonight. You’re a criminal. And you’re gonna be fine. Just be yourself. The security door is behind you.
Be yourself. [ He propels her toward a buffet table, causing a distraction ]
[ To Madeline ] Mind if I cut in? What are you doing here, Madeline?
I came to watch you.
My plane is 15 minutes from here. We could be in Tegucigalpa by breakfast.
What would you like to know?
Fate.
You think?
I was serious about Tegucigalpa. What do you think? Right now.
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! There was a man. He had a gun. The man had a gun.
[ Acting over–the–top gay ] There you are! What the hell happened to you?! You just leave me stranded with that awful Algerian?! He’s been hitting on me for 20 minutes!
Well, not secure enough if you ask me, sister. You know what? Why don’t you ask Rasil? We wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for that troublemaker. Always an agenda with him. Cultural attaché. Culture my ass. The things I do for this one. Gallivanting around the globe for your little assignations with you–know–hmm–hmm, carrying her furs and bikinis as if I wouldn’t rather be back in Dutchess County with my shelties. Hey, don’t take anything for granted! Everything you have was bought and paid for by your boyfriend! Do you have any idea whose horn this tramp is blowing? Let’s just say it starts with Bashar and ends with Assad, gassing you faster than a Sunni. So, let’s get her out of the hot seat and into a limo– good God! – Crumbs up! – What? Your cummerbund. Pleats up! You look like Bob Yoshimura in 8th–grade swing choir. It’s upside down!
Aah! God, that hurts! Ohh!
I don’t know. It just felt so right in the moment.
Gone.
Gone with her.
Tell me about the coordinates. What coordinates?
I had a little talk with Rasil. We had a few laughs, compared notes about you. He told me all about that delightful thing you do with a trouser belt, which was a bit hurtful, since I was pretty sure it was our thing. The coordinates.
I ran out of gas.
I was so excited to get home, I didn’t even bother to look. My head was just –  I ran out of gas.
It was Christmas Eve. I pulled off to the side of the road. Seemed like it’d been snowing for days. No traffic. No cars to come help. Just me and a car full of gifts. It was more than 20 years ago. I must have walked four miles five, maybe. It was so still. Just cold and white. The whole time, all I could think about was them in our house. The warm light in the windows, the smoke from the chimney. The sound of my daughter at the piano. The smell of the tree and the fire, oyster stew on the stove. I was so upset to think that I’d ruined Christmas for them, being late, leaving the gifts in the car. But the closer I got, the more I realized how funny the whole thing was, how much they’d love the story, daddy running out of gas, how every Christmas they’d get such joy from telling that story at my expense. And then, finally I got there. I walked I walked through the door. And there was just blood. All I saw was blood. All there was was blood. I can I can still s–smell the nape of her neck, feel her little fingers on my cheek her whisper in my ear. That’s why I didn’t show up in Florence. It’s why I haven’t shown up in a lot of places over the years.
[ On phone ] We have the location of the effigy.
Yes.
We should have gone to Tegucigalpa.
It appears Madeline sent us on a good old–fashioned snipe hunt.
Let’s talk about the effigy.
Or maybe Madeline double-crossed the Russians and kept the coordinates to the nukes for herself and led you to believe it was all a myth.
While you were chasing the effigy, I was coming to terms with Madeline. In a moment of weakness, she gave me the coordinates.
I thought you might have a passing interest in rounding up some Russian mobsters.
Relax, Harold. I have no use for rusty Russian firecrackers left over from the ’60s.
And you want the bombs. How about a trade? 
[ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] What is this? A ’78?
My father loved Cadillacs.
She’s calling herself Jolene Parker.
You don’t have all the information.
No. She’s –
No, I don’t.
I love hats. But that honestly, that takes a certain kind of man. What size are you? I’m a 7 1/2.
I don’t want you to find her. I know where she is. I want you to tell me where she’s been. Cities, safe houses, aliases. She’s already faked her death to elude me. Now she’s back. I want you to tell me everything you can about where she’s been, what she’s been up to.
[ Door closes ] Lizzy. Have you seen the paper?
Mark Hastings, US Attorney from Maryland – the head of the Reynoso Cartel.
I believe he was held captive, but not by the Reynoso cartel. It’s all quite a mystery. They say he’s too traumatized to speak. But if what I believe about Hastings is true, if he has been held captive all these years, then it would confirm that the myth is true – The Judge is real.
Every culture has a justice myth, an avenging angel who exacts retribution for the weak and innocent. Golem for the Jews, Tu Po for the Chinese. The Ancient Greeks had Adrestia, the Goddess Of Revenge.
Prisoners can state their case, argue their innocence, explain why they were convicted unfairly and who is responsible – a prosecutor, a corrupt detective, maybe an incompetent public defender.
Supposedly, it’s passed among inmates until it finally reaches some book depository at the FederalPenitentiary in  Monroe, Virginia.
Nobody knows for sure. Nobody’s ever met him. Somehow, the appeals make their way to The Judge. He reviews the case, and if he thinks you’re innocent, he evens the score. If freedom or life were taken unfairly, he demands the same in return – an eye for an eye.
This Jolene is definitely moving towards something.
By whom?
Alan Ray Rifkin? –
Back up, Lizzy.
Rifkin. Go back to Rifkin. Why would The Judge hold Cooper responsible for his execution?
You’re certain of that?
How about the guy The Judge released?
If you ever want to see Cooper again, you need to get Hastings to talk. Lizzy, I must be going.
[ Cellphone beeps ] Dembe, you better tell Edward there’s gonna be a change in flight plan.
Richard. Say something, Richard. I keep meaning to attend our academy class reunions, and I remember how pinched I look in dinner dress blues.
How’s your family?
Yes. Richard, I need to know about the Rifkin case. He claims civilians were fired on by soldiers from a Black Hawk that CENTCOM says it never deployed.
You were operational in the Guldara District. If there were choppers in the air, you knew about it.
I’m offering you an opportunity, Richard. The men who want this information can be very helpful. If you help them, it could put you back on track.
Lizzy, have you located Harold?
There’s been a development.
Of course. A woman.
I didn’t. I came to advocate on behalf of you. After devoting your life to a pursuit of the truth, to making things right, it would be such a shame in your last act to get it so wrong. This is a classified Pentagon file on the Rifkin case. In the spirit of full disclosure, it’s a felony for me to have it or for you to see it. But under the circumstances, who are we to quibble? It states that on October 3, 2002, US military intelligence officers deployed a unit by helicopter to the village of Guldara in the Kabul Province of Afghanistan to extract an asset whose identity had been compromised. The Taliban in the area with whom Alan Ray Rifkin had aligned himself got word of the informant and advanced on the village. But they were too late. The boys had extracted their asset and left. Angry and suspicious of others, the Taliban and Rifkin set fire to the village and executed inhabitants. Dozens of women and children were killed at the hands of the Taliban in response to US military intelligence in the area. I guess, fearing more headlines, the Pentagon wanted no association with the incident, so they covered it up. That is what happened. That is the truth. That’s why you’re not gonna light up Agent Cooper today. Alan Ray Rifkin wasn’t executed because of a beating or because of a cover–up. He was executed because of the truth. Now, you and I could talk for days about the whys and why–nots of an execution, but at the end of it all, in the final moment, the only irrefutable fact is you better be right. And I’m betting you’re not so sure.
Mark Hastings. You let him go because he had served his time, because this has always been about justice in your eyes, not blind revenge. The day you started this, you knew it would inevitably end, that when you released your first prisoner, you would get caught. You don’t want to diminish your legacy of righteousness because of him which is why you’re going to surrender. Harold, don’t look so glum. Come on.
Harold, a war is coming. I believe the incursion of this facility and the rather sudden disappearance of Diane Fowler were just the beginning, and I’m certain that things will get considerably worse before they get better.
Not now. Later. But when I do, I hope you’ll remember what happened today.
No. I’d like you to reach out to Admiral Richard Abraham, he was very helpful in resolving the matters of the day. He’s had a rough go of it for quite some time.
Yes. Admiral Richard. He’s a good man. I wonder if you could pull a few strings.
What have you found?
No. I believe she’s finishing an operation. I’d like to see how it plays out.
She’s calling herself Jolene Parker.
I wanted to deliver the check personally, Christine.
Will it be ready in time?
What do they do for lunch? Do they order in or eat salads out of those tupperware bowls? How does it work with dancers?
I’ll see you on the 22nd. And please send my thanks to your mother. []
I heard Agent Raimo was relieved of his viscera.
Agent Ressler, please.
I’m the one who reached out to you, Donald. And it wasn’t to revisit all the times I eluded your little coterie of door–kickers who pursued me with such fervor and zeal. I came to discuss a former associate of mine who your team arrested along the way Mako Tanida.
He was. Two days ago, he broke out of Abashiri. If you ask the Japanese, they’ll skirt it. They claim Abashiri is escape–proof. It’s embarrassing. They’re touchy about that sort of thing. I suspect Tanida is the one who killed your agent friend.
There’s a thought. But for the moment, the scalp I’m worried about is yours. Tanida is disciplined, relentless. If he did kill Agent Raimo, there’s the distinct possibility he’s just getting started. I fear, Donald, that you’re being hunted by a vengeful, ruthless killer.
She still in town?
Bring her to me.
It has.
Oh? Why is that?
The pot meets the kettle at last. Bring me the girl.
Searching in the desert for a drop of vengeance to slake an unquenchable thirst is a lonely walk, my friend.♤
Donald, I understand how you feel. Beneath the iron-and-rust exterior beats the heart of a man swimming in immeasurable grief. I am truly sorry about Audrey. There are few that understand love and loss more than I.
Let me tell you something that someone much wiser than I told me at a similar point in my life. Go home. Turn back from this and go home. It may seem like the hardest thing in the world, but it is profoundly easier than what you’re contemplating.
That’s pretty much what I said.
In your dust–up with Tanida, were there any survivors?
Injuries?
There’s a house in Columbia Heights doubles as an underground hospital.
Agent Ressler. Once you cross over, there are things in the darkness that can keep your heart from ever feeling the light again.♤
Good. You’re gonna need it.
No, I understand, but I don’t care about the Prince … No, no, no, no, no The 22nd … That was our agreement … Christina, I don’t care about production issues. Please just figure it out by the 22nd.
Agent Ressler came to me for assistance, which I provided.
No. I provided a bit of direction in an otherwise blind pursuit.
Nobody can murder someone in cold blood and come out okay on the other end.♤
He’s dead.
Aiko Tanida died the day his brother was captured by Ressler’s task force. Anyone who tells you otherwise doesn’t know the difference between a water buffalo and a musk ox.
The cowboy, have you found him?
The girl?
“Donald, I want you to know that I do understand how you feel.” 
Good morning, Mr. Kaplan.
Oh, my God, what is this?
How do I get one?
Okay. Let’s see what we have here. Your ability to locate a crime scene never ceases to amaze. You’re like a human bloodhound.
How long?
As much as I’d love to see that, it won’t be necessary. The whodunit has already been solved. Perhaps another time, though.
I don’t want any indication that we ever set foot here, – so please put it all back the way you found it.
Your phone. I’d like to report a missing person.
Sorry. Something came up.
Yeah, fine.
Just a little restoration.♤
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Yes. But not about this.
A car accident. Killed the driver, Nathan Platt.
Because it was no accident. The crash was engineered by a notorious cyber criminal known only as Ivan, or Ivan.
I’ve had some experience with the man. He stole from me. His brother and I spent a delightful evening sharing stories over a plate of meat jelly and half a gallon of vodka. All the while, Ivan had his hand in my wallet.
How about a confession? Ivan took credit for the hit in some deep, dark recess of the internet– a place only inhabited by scary people and reckless teenagers. A place where curiosity inevitably kills the cat.
Given his technological skills, he wouldn’t even need to get his hands dirty. Ivan’s had a very long career–  Russian markets, selling off government secrets, disrupting Siberian pipelines.
This is the first time Ivan’s ever struck on US soil, a fact that should have you all very concerned, because whatever he has planned, this is only the very beginning.
So, the federal government has armed a cyber terrorist with the digital equivalent of a nuclear warhead. Another fabulous example of your tax dollars at work and yet another reason why I don’t pay taxes.
Kastrychnitski Rayon. It’s in Minsk, Belarus. That’s where Ivan is currently.
I’ve always known this.
You FBI are such blunt instruments. Lizzy, you don’t just swoop in and arrest a man like Ivan, because you know what he’ll tell you once he’s in custody? Nothing.
If you want to know what Ivan is up to, you have to get him to share that. Not because he has to, because he wants to.
We create a problem for him and then solve it. And to do that, we need to take a field trip.
Perhaps the face escapes you. My card. Allow me to refresh your memory. Grand Cayman Bank account number… It held approximately $5 million, and then, suddenly, it didn’t. It was a clever hack. Kudos and all that. But I’ve come to collect – with interest.
I wouldn’t go out there if I were you.
Yes, but not from me. Seems you’ve stirred up the borscht, Ivan. Murdering that NSA troll got the FBI talking to the FSB. Now you’re neck-deep in the beets, Ivan. They’ve issued an arrest order for you. According to my informant, they’re en route here now.
Mmm! This piroshki is delicious. My point – I can secure safe travel for you out of the country – for a price.
Oh, there’s my cue. You’re on your own, comrade.
I thought you might have a change of heart. Shall we? $8 million. I want it transferred to this account.
Let’s get out of here. Not until I have my payment.
Then you’d better type fast.
See? Do you find all those little fingerprints on the glass distracting, or does that sort of thing not bother you?
So, tell me, Ivan, what are your intentions? I assume you took the Skeleton Key for one of three reasons– some dastardly deed you have planned, something dastardly someone else has planned, or you’ve lined up a buyer and have no idea what they have planned. I’m curious, what’s your price?
Don’t be coy, Ivan. Whatever the number, I can likely double it. You could probably use the retirement money right about now.
Then who was it?
Then if you didn’t do it, who did?
Perhaps I could be of some assistance.
So, how exactly does a 17-year-old kid slip through your fingers?
If you ever find him, ask him if he’d like to earn some extra money.
Well, it sounds like you have everything well under control, which begs the question, why are you here?
Hand me that piece right there.
Was there any evidence connecting any of this to me?
Then what exactly would you like me to do?
I can’t answer that.
Well, that’s a matter of interpretation.
I wish I knew the whole truth.
I have never lied to you.♤
Come in.
It’s a 1940s Sorrento music box.
You’re going to be okay.♤ 
I come bearing gifts– pimento cheese sandwiches, toasted with the crusts cut off. Eartha Kitt’s recipe. It’s a fantastic story.
Lizzy, I’m not sure if I can shed any–
Little more than you. Several years ago, it came to my attention that somebody was meddling in my business. To protect myself and my interests, I inventoried my vulnerabilities.
Among others. Lizzy, I’ve been monitoring Tom since he entered your life. About a year ago, I discovered that he had purchased three passports from a trusted forger I use in Warsaw.
I can only assume that’s the case.
That is just a distraction.
Right now, the only thing that matters is the immediate threat– your husband– finding out who he is and who he works for. The rest will come. I promise you.
Surveillance footage, taken by the people who were hired to watch you and Tom.
Some. Enough. Perhaps you’ll see something that I could not.
Things are unraveling for him. He’s desperate to keep you close. I think you’ve been presented with a unique opportunity. The people Tom works for are obviously very cautious. They operate slowly from the shadows. I’ve spent years tracking them, to no avail. We now have a chance to draw them out. Things will have to appear normal to Tom, to Cooper, and the others. Which is why you’ll need a case.
Cvetko, you rascal. You wouldn’t believe how hard it is to find a Bosnian in San Salvador.
Oh, this looks rather ghoulish. Vlad, I need your help identifying somebody.
Of course you can. I have a fingerprint. Benson ran it, got a name.
She says the print belongs to a Craig Keen. Well, Craig Keen is an alias – a very good one at that, complete with a credit rating, school and medical records, passports with a long history – all the trimmings.
What do you know about touch DNA?
I know very little, but as I understand it, it’s possible to actually lift tissue cells from a fingerprint and run the DNA?
How is Fadila? Vlad, it was a mistake. I can easily blame it on the hashish and the grappa, but the truth is– may I speak freely? You’re better off without her. She’s fickle.I’m sorry, but this business with the fingerprint– it’s important. Do you still have that little villa in Dubrovnik?
A weekend there with Fadila. She would love it. I can’t understand why you insist on chasing that woman. All right. The villa is yours. And if it doesn’t work out with Fadila, I know a ravishing Dane who would adore you. She’s slightly cross-eyed and there’s something very hypnotic about her gaze.
How’s your case developing, Lizzy?
Have you figured out how he selects them, the common denominator?
Well, there you have it. You only know these assassins were ill because of their autopsies and police reports. You know after they’re already dead. But somehow, The Undertaker knows before. Find out how he knows that, and you’ll find your man. Where are we with Craig? Is he still in town?
Good. Find him. Watch him.
Yes. I think it’s time for the three of us to have a little chat.
Looks like we’re a little late to the party. You must be the brother–in–law.
Oh, hell. Dembe, get the hacksaw. We’re gonna have to take him out of here in pieces. I’m just kidding. We’ll get old Christopher to talk. Who’s up for a field trip? 
Terrifying. You know, this artist got his start with puppets. What is it about puppets? It’s the same with clowns. I’ll never forget a puppet show I saw when I was 5, maybe 6.”Hansel and Gretel.”
Scared me to death. But it wasn’t the witch. It was the oven. Imagine an oven puppet. I don’t think I set foot in our kitchen for a month.
God, I miss Bob Ross. That television painter with the little squirrel on his shoulder and the happy little trees. Few strokes with a palette knife and an entire mountain range would emerge through the clouds– absolutely mesmerizing. Well, let’s go back to the hotel.I think I saw some yogurt pretzels in your mini bar.
Wait.
Shh, shh, shh. Watch – the hat.
Unlike someone who shall remain nameless, we waited for you. Shall we get started? 
It’s your husband.
Tell me about Berlin. Berlin.
What’s in Berlin? Is the bank in Berlin?  Christopher who’s in Berlin? Dembe, we’re moving the conversation elsewhere. Wipe down the room.
Tell me about the building.
Okay, then.
Putting on my coat.
Yes. And your husband, the police, and all the king’s men will be here soon. If you care to stick around and explain, feel free. But I, for one, will not be in attendance. Dembe, I’ll get her downstairs. After you’re finished, grab the pretzels.
Yes.
 Good night, Harold
Be patient. With Craig, things have been set in motion. How Tom reacts will tell us a great deal. You need to stay the course.
I don’t know yet.
Lizzy Be careful of your husband.
I can only lead you to the truth. I can’t make you believe it.
Right now, the only thing that matters is the immediate threat. Your husband. Finding out who he is and who he works for. … The rest will come. I promise you.
What makes you say that?
Yes.
I felt if I told you it would inform your behavior with him. I found her body, called the police, and reported a missing person. I was confident, in the course of their investigation, they would reach out to you and Tom, and they did. Jolene Parker undoubtedly worked for the same organization as Tom. In what capacity, I have no idea.
Perhaps he was ordered to. Or perhaps he’s just out of control, irrational, paranoid and reactionary. He’s scrambling for a foothold, and therein lies our opportunity to wait and to watch. But Tom is not the reason I’m here. I’m afraid there’s something quite timely afoot. The Pavlovich brothers are back in town.
Where are you?
The brothers. They took Xiaoping Li.
Your husband is not in school.
Meet me at 9th and Constitution.
Called in sick this morning. Returned home briefly before making a stop at the Radford Bank in Adams Morgan. He’s made three phone calls. All from pay phones. He’s been sitting at that cart for nearly an hour. I’m sorry, Lizzy.
This must be difficult.
We are.
Lizzy, wait, wait, wait. What are you do –
Your husband never existed. Lizzy, I understand why you went after Tom today. The instinct to jump in is –  But it isn’t gonna serve you well here. And from the emotional point of view, this must feel like an extraordinary violation and betrayal. But for Tom it was business.
Unfortunately, Lizzy, you’re chest–deep in filth, and you’re gonna have to wade through it – to get to the other side.
Time is the only thing that will allow you to find yourself again.
Lizzy, if you want to find where the Pavlovich brothers are, you need to find out where they’ve been. The helicopter is key. 
Hello, Symir. I’ll be brief and to the point. Yesterday you had a customer. Picked him up outside the national archives.
Ohh, Symir. You should have taken the money. Your passenger. Where’d you drop him? Calculus.
I can’t even think about derivatives without thinking of that tutor in manor hall Cindy something–or–other. Never wore a brassiere; Always a bounce in her step.
So, tell me about the book.
What is it? Some kind of code? How many times have you done this these drops?
I need you to write down the location of each drop you’ve made. The pickup and the drop location. Oh, my God. What? Pagosa Springs public library? I had a water pump go out in Pagosa Springs. Bitch of a mountain Wolf Creek Pass. Thought I was gonna end up living out there with the hill people until this Teddy bear of a man fixed me up at the local garage. I’ll never forget him. Tracy Woods. You don’t know Tracy, do you? Leather vest, mustache Tracy Woods?
I wonder if he’s still fixing water pumps. Anyway, it’ll always be a fond memory. The list.
You’re gonna deliver it or return it or whatever the people you work for want you to do with it. And as far as you’re concerned, we never had this conversation. Dembe? A copy, please. I hope you have nothing pressing. This may take a minute or three. You sure you don’t know him? Leather vest, mustache Tracy Woods? Shame.
And it’s on the list of drop sites I gave you?
How long has Mr. Keen been inside?
Lovely. Thank you, Preston.
That would be ideal, but he’s working an extraction in Ecuador.
Excellent. Tell me.
Lizzy, about Tom
You have your opinion on how to proceed, and I have mine.
Lizzy, I assure you that will yield no answers and little satisfaction.
I wish I could talk you out of this.
Well, good luck with Xiaoping.
Good afternoon, gentlemen. I’m Raymond Reddington.
Who?
I have no use for germ warfare. And as for using the FBI? I wouldn’t be in this relationship if there wasn’t a mutual benefit.
I don’t know. I tried to bargain for her life, but negotiations went sideways. It was all I could do to get Tom.
Tell me what you know.
She isn’t cargo, Lizzy. She’s contraband. This is a smuggling operation. And nothing gets smuggled in or out of the Chesapeake without Rolph Cisco knowing about it. Have Donald pay him a visit.
No, we’ll just let the tail follow him.
No.
They are.
This is an end. And then something new will begin. You deserve the best in life, Lizzy. I know that sounds odd coming from a man who has brought you some of the worst, but it’s the reason why Tom had to work so hard to be that for you. To be kind, to be thoughtful, make you laugh, to make you love him. Because you deserve that. And it will come.
I can’t let you do that.
I thought we had an arrangement.
[ Red laughs ] Niko! My goodness!
Look at you. You’re wasting away.
All from swimming?
I was a lifeguard my junior year in high school. Had to give mouth–to–mouth to Mrs. Beerman. She belched up a lung full of corned beef and chlorine. I haven’t been in a pool since.
Enough. To business.
What happened in Prague is unfortunate, but how it happened is of more concern. I believe it’s a frame. Dusek was targeted.
The Kingmaker.
Yes. What I don’t know is who retained him.
Watch your tone.
I don’t have any friends.
These “friends” you mention, the ones whispering in the shadows tell them from me “Shut the hell up.” 
Jamie, tell your people I’ll have an answer by the end of the week, but whether or not we do business, I’m keeping all the samples. Lizzy. Perfect timing. Say hello to Jamie.
What a delightful man – scrupulous mind for business, sharp as a tack.
He’s in New York. Not to worry. My people are watching. Please excuse the house. My host spends a tremendous amount of money on all the wrong things.
Cannabis. Jamie’s trying to form a huge consortium of farms and warehouses outside Denver and having a little trouble securing the financing, so I would be the bank. I’d offer you an edible, but we have work to do. The Kingmaker. I’ve never met the man, but I recently lost a great deal of time and money to his talents. He’s single–handedly responsible for the rise and fall of some of the world’s most pivotal politicians and statesmen.
He’s raised opposition research to an art form. He arranges scandals, exploits proclivities, assassinates when necessary. I don’t know how he chooses his clients, but they say he grooms them from an early age the right universities [ Knock on door ] mentors, even spouses. And when they’re ready to run, he does whatever it takes to assure their victory.
Yes. Please. And thank you. My sources say he left Prague within the last 12 hours on a flight to the United States.
What I’ve lost is the luxury of time, Alan. I don’t have a week to wait around for your minions to pass my request up the food chain.
As much as I appreciate a good sports metaphor, what I’ve come to discuss requires a somewhat more dramatic analogy. I’m under attack and have been for some time my interests, my allies. Someone has targeted my key infrastructure, and the truth is, I’m bleeding.
Because my enemy is your enemy.
By my estimation, we not only co–exist we depend on each other to survive. What I possess would lay waste to you and your Alliance.
I have no intention of making it public. But this enemy of mine, if he prevails and, in so doing, finds himself in possession of that information he may very well choose not to be so discreet.
I’m not here to threaten you. I’m here to see if we can work together.
Some freshman politician is suddenly thrust into the spotlight, his selfless heroism on full display. I suspect Assemblyman Patrick Chandler’s poll numbers are about to go through the roof. It just reeks of The Kingmaker.
Yes. Go out to the bridge. Perhaps you can figure out why there aren’t any tire marks.
If The Kingmaker chose that pay phone of all the phones in the city, there’s a reason.
Le Claire’s pawn shop.
Mr. Gibbons.
Thank you.
No, thank you. [ Lounge music playing ] Ah. Smells like decadence and vice. The Ohlbaum Philly, please. Make it two.
Exactly. The Kingmaker he was here. That guy over there – Don’t look.
With the hair.
No. He won the gold medal for the clean and jerk for Belarus. Magnificent drinker, smokes like a chimney.
Well, hold it, at least. Wave it around. At least look like someone who wants to be here. The owner will make his rounds soon enough.
Mm. Forgive Melissa. Should we go?
You sure?
What’s this about, Lizzy?
I knew your father, and he knew me.
No, I didn’t.
I went to see Sam before he died. I said goodbye. [ Footsteps approach ] Charles. Good to see you again, my friend. Ah, bless you, Charles. You are my friend. Natalie here is under the impression I don’t have any. Listen, Charles, I need to know whether this gentleman has been in recently.
Oh, my God! Mali! The tiniest lady on Earth. What a marvel. The things she could do.
[ Laughing ] That’s right on her head! I wish you could have met her.
How perfectly on the nose. Did he happen to leave a telephone number when he made his reservation?
[ Footsteps approach ] I’ve been sitting here for almost 20 minutes.
I can’t remember the last time –
I take it you spoke with your colleagues.
That’s a mistake.
And if the evidence in my possession is compromised?
And that would be another mistake. You know me considerably better than either of us would like to admit. I will win this war. This enemy of mine will lose. Even with you and your shortsighted brethren watching safely from a distant hill. Why? Because as bad as you may think I am, as far as you think I’m willing to go to protect that which I hold most dear, you can’t possibly fathom how deep that well of mine truly goes. You think you’ve come here simply to say that you can’t help me, but all you’ve done is ensure that when this is all over, I won’t be able to help you. When the day inevitably comes that I settle up with your little Alliance, it will be you, Alan, alone in the dark.
What have you got, Lizzy?
You have him? He was targeting Senator Mitchell so that Chandler could take his seat. Lizzy, listen to me very closely. I need you to hold him for me. That’s all I need.
There’s a politician in Prague. The Kingmaker was hired to take him out of play. I need to know who commissioned that.
It’s the entire reason I brought you this case.
 Door opens ] Oh! You mnh. [ Door closes ] [ Footsteps approach ] Give us a moment. Lizzy, I have an update for you on the movements of your husband. Apparently, Tom has –
Yes.
It’s not quite that simple.
I don’t expect you to understand.
Listen to me. I’ve been friends with Sam for all of yours and most of my life. He was dying. Every part of his body was failing. He was impatient for it to end. He’d asked to be disconnected from all the machines. He was in pain and suffering. And he wasn’t thinking clearly. If he were, he would never have chosen to tell you any of it. It wasn’t his choice to make. We said goodbye and I put him out of his misery.
Worse than I thought.
Hello, Agent Keen.
[ Who is also in Cooper’s office] I have an urgent case.
That’s not going to work.
No.
This case relates directly to your husband and why he was here. I have reason to believe an attack is imminent.
People are going to die, Harold.
Agent Keen, are you really willing to put your anger at me above the lives of innocent people?
Earlier today, a man died at The Westland Bank in Manhattan. Reports indicate the cause of death may have been the Cullen virus. HazMat teams have quarantined the bank. The deceased has been identified as a Paul Blankenship, an armored–truck driver. They’re working to identify how he was infected. Paul Blankenship didn’t pick up this bug while wandering through subtropical Africa. I believe he was infected as part of a larger plot involving myself and this task force.
I suspect this incident at the bank is not what it seems, but rather the first shot in a larger, coordinated assault aimed directly at me. I don’t think Paul Blankenship was a victim of an outbreak. I think he was a foot soldier in a biological army. I think he was meant to carry out orders by a superior, someone who’s willing to use one of the world’s most deadly viruses to further their cause.
The very threat of an outbreak would cause panic, fear. And fear is a valuable tool to get people to do what you want.
Listen, I can’t connect all the dots between the incident at the bank and the eventual outcome, but I sincerely doubt his death was part of the plan, a plan devised by someone who doesn’t care how many people die, as long as I’m one of them.
You realize if you leave, the task force ends. Everyone’s lives go back to normal, except yours.
He was the lead research scientist on infectious diseases at USAMRIID and the foremost expert on the Cullen virus.
No, the work he’s done has been criminalized, which is why he left USAMRIID. But if anybody knows anything about black–market viruses, it’s Dr.Bruce Sanders. This is a copy of Tom’s code book. It was used to pass information between Tom and his superiors. I had my associate Borakove decode it. There’s surprisingly little about myself and my organization, but it contains speculation about our cases and a great deal about you. I suggest you use some discretion as to how you disclose any of it. It’s an olive branch, Lizzy.
Please, Monique, tell me he’s not testing his pincushion voodoo on the patients. He’s still doing research?
One of the brightest men I’ve ever met.  Dr. Sanders. I don’t know if you remember me, but –
Raymond.
I met Dr. Sanders here through a mutual friend to discuss a very delicate and underfunded research project. As I recall, the science was awesome but financially precarious. We did, however, spend a glorious weekend in God’s country with two snow bunnies who were dead ringers for the Swiss miss girl.
Yes. Space Ranger. What a memory. I heard you went through a bit of a rough patch. But it looks like you’ve landed on your feet.
And you’ve relocated.
Dr. Sanders is at the forefront of virology. He’s been working tirelessly to find cures for some of the world’s most deadly illnesses. A few years back, he injected himself with meningitis and along with what he thought was a synthesized cure.
Doctor, we’ve come to you on pressing business. What can you tell us about the Cullen virus?
How do you know?
Is he still active?
UD-4126 was never – That wormy little bastard could barely land the simulator, let alone carry out an Alpha–level mission.
Anything you can share?
Whatever you’ve got. I’d love our people at the lab – to give this a once–over.
Well, I’ll say.
Not the slightest.
Lizzy, someone is using a unique and deadly pathogen.
I don’t know.
What are you doing?
Of course he won’t.
I thought you and I weren’t on speaking terms.
How reminiscent of elementary school.
A gift from your husband. It’s a tattoo from the neck of an associate of mine a message of sorts. It’s a reminder of the kind of people we’re dealing with.About our trip to see Dr. Sanders, will you be traveling with me, or are you flying coach again? 
She’s been cleared Alpha level. You want me to get Chesterfield on the line?
He doesn’t know his name.
Bruce, lives are at stake. UD-4126 I need some way of knowing who that is.
Lizzy.
Where?
Why?
Lizzy, what have you done? 
And you set this meeting so they could take me.
Lizzy, you’re obviously here now because you sense this meeting was a mistake. Is that true?
This mistake I’d like to hear more about it.
Not until I hear from Agent Keen. You should wait in the vehicle, Dembe.
I’m sorry, Lizzy. Please go on. You were going to tell me about your change of heart.
What changed, Lizzy? What are you –
None of that matters.
This is about Sam.
What did you learn about Sam?
So, this is where it ends.
They’re already here, Lizzy. What are they gonna do to me that hasn’t been done before? Kill me? None of it is worse than losing you. Please excuse the gun. I’d hate for them to think we’re in cahoots.
You should go.
And I can’t get them without you. So I guess we’re stuck with each other.
I was once on the island of Ko Ri, free-diving in the Andaman Sea. I felt terribly ill stung by a lionfish. I was dehydrated, in excruciating pain. I had lost all sense of time and place. I was completely disoriented. But I knew I was dying, so I readied myself for it. And in that moment, at death’s door, I looked up, and standing over me in the brightness was this landless Moken sea gypsy just standing there, smiling. She and her tribe nursed me back to health, good as new. And when I left the island she kissed me. It was like a burst of sunlight on my cheek. It was – It made nearly dying well worth it. That’s how I feel now.
Now it begins.
That stuff you use in your hair – is that Brylcreem? My father used Brylcreem. [ Pause ] Yes.
The girl. She’s worth it.
Perhaps if you had accepted my offer of alliance, neither of us would find ourselves in this position now – you managing a massive intelligence failure and national-news spectacle and me with this enchanting view.
Does that mean you intend to let the animal out of its cage?
That’s all I need. I can take care of the rest.
Of course it would have to be you, because lady luck just adores me that much.♤
Well, I’ve never been one to shy away from a challenge. [ Hits him. Car swerves, crashes, Red escapes ]
[ On pay phone ] Lizzy. Listen to me. You’re in danger. Everyone on the task force is a target.
There’ll be time to explain later. For now, pull everyone back. You are all in danger. 
The day we met, you asked me why I surrendered to the FBI. There were many reasons. One of them was Berlin. That’s why he’s here – because the work we’ve done has forced him out of the shadows. He can’t allow the task force to continue. Meera was a casualty in a war she didn’t even know she was fighting. I’m afraid just by association, I’ve made you all potential targets.
It’s all just pieces of a much larger puzzle, and until all the pieces are laying in front of you, it won’t go together. What I do know is this – Sam’s involvement was as your father. And no one can pervert or distort that. Right now, our task is to identify our enemy – our enemy today. Berlin wasn’t the only prisoner on that plane, and whoever wanted him wanted the others, as well. You need to find out who that someone is.
Mmm. Good evening, Ambassador.
No need to worry. Tuzik and I are getting along splendidly. Care for a peach? I rarely enter someone’s home for the first time without bringing a gift, and there’s a wonderful little produce stand around the corner. I’m calling the police. Mr. Ambassador, as we speak, there’s an unmarked plane being pulled from the East River. I think we both know that plane is Russian.
You really should try the peaches. They’re perfectly ripe– and freestone. Unlike a clingstone, the pit of a freestone separates more freely from the flesh, making it ideal for consumption. The prisoners on that plane– I need the manifest.
Oh, my goodness, no. I’m not a monster. You really think I’d harm a dog? You, on the other hand – [ Throws knife and hits ambassador in the thigh ] 
Milos Pavel Kinsky – sometimes known as “Berlin.” He’s a Russian national, former Spetsnaz Commando, trained in the KGB’s 45 Division. Organized crime is now his fancy.
I’m just as curious as you.
Access. The kind even the FBI doesn’t have. All those spinning satellites that record every keystroke, every phone call, everybody’s dirty little secrets. You find him for me, and I’ll do the rest.
Find him.
The way Sam told the story was that one night, an old friend showed up at his door scared. The friend told Sam he was leaving town, that he was in danger and that he needed someone to care for a little girl that her father had died that night in a fire. So Sam took the little girl in, and he raised her as his own always sheltering her from the truth about her biological father.
I killed Sam because he was in pain and he wanted to die and because I had to protect you from the truth.♤
Yes. And knowing his identity would put you in grave danger.
I loved Sam, Lizzy. Taking his life was of all the difficult things that I’ve done that may may be the most. But I did it to keep you from learning the name of your real father, to protect you. And you must understand – having done that, I’m certainly not going to tell you who he was now.
Yes?
I’m listening.
Yes.
We’ll have to keep looking. [[ Does this count as a lie? ]]
You must be the one they call “Berlin.” 
I must say, I’m very good at finding people. I’ve tracked enemies far and wide. I once found a hedge–fund manager hiding in the Amazon with the Yawalapiti on the banks of the Kuluene River. You know what the key to finding your enemies is? Remembering everyone’s name. It’s critical to my survival. Anyone knows the head of some drug cartel in Colombia, some politician in Paris. But I know their wives, girlfriends, children, their enemies, their friends. I know their favorite bartender, their butcher. I remember the name of the baker I stole the strawberry bismark from when I was 11 years old and his wife–Trudy Svoboda. But you– I have no idea who in the Sam Hill you are. I have not a clue what I’ve done to you, what I’ve taken from you. And yet, of all the people I’ve hurt, none of them have come after me with half as much vim and vigor as you. I don’t even recognize your face. I’m stymied. And yet, here we are. You found me.
Help me understand what horrible thing I did to you that could possibly make all of this worth it. Who on God’s green Earth are you? What was that? Being shot in the hand is just an absolute bitch– all those little bones. At least it goes right through. Worst part, honestly, is needing somebody to help zip your fly. Tell me your story. I’m not leaving here without a story. Being shot in the hip, on the other hand– Jiminy Cricket. Thick bone, large artery not to mention the fact that it makes walking upright forever impossible. Just don’t pass out. Stay focused. The story. What did I do to you? How about the kneecap? The IRA always loved a good kneecapping.
The Campolongo Incident.
No. Are you hurt?
Well, that simplifies matters. Just the three of us. [ Red stretches arms out, pointing his gun away from Tom, begins walking toward him ] Tom, put the gun down before you do something you’ll deeply regret. I’m the one you want. Make the right choice, Tom. But make it fast. Because when I get over there, I’m gonna take that gun away from you. [Tom shoots at Red, but Liz’s hair obstructs his shot, and he only nicks Red’s shoulder, Red flinches. Liz Turns and struggles with Tom for his gun. She gets it and shoots Tom three times in the abdomen. He slumps down wall to floor. Red quickly approaches Tom, is about to shoot him.]
We can’t leave him alive.
Do it quickly. I’ll be waiting outside.
Yes, I know.
He spoke of Beirut 2010, the Campolongo incident– an unfortunate mess, but Berlin’s attacks on my business started years earlier. The moment he said it, I knew.
Berlin needs to believe I think he’s dead. It provides us with an advantage.
Lizzy, there’s something I want you to understand about your father Sam. That night when he took you in– without hesitation– Sam made a difficult choice that changed the course of his life. And that’s where you find yourself now. You can turn away and run from it. You can hide from it. And if you choose to do that, I’ll fly away. Or you can face it and confront it engage it. And maybe– maybe you prevail and rise above it.
I understand. I’ll be on a plane tonight.
What was that?
Lizzy, look at me.
I’m telling you, with no uncertainty, your father is dead. He died in that fire.
Yes. And we’ll find him.
[ Chuckling  ] Oh, my stars. Is that how you cope with this insufferable humidity? I couldn’t do it.
We did.
Tell the boy not to pull on the brim of the hat.
I’ve come to propose a business transaction.
Typically, I steer clear of tin-pot dictators who employ boy soldiers, but I’m afraid this situation is unique.
Well, now you’re being shortsighted.
Tell him to put the gun down.
I’m glad to know you’re a man of decisive action. You see, Yaabari, you didn’t actually find me. I found you. And while your prepubescent ruffians may not know it, they brought me here to strike a deal that could benefit all of us.
A man calling himself Berlin hired a bounty hunter to find me and my associates. That bounty hunter worked for you. I’ve since dispatched of him, but if Berlin hired one bounty hunter, he hired five. I want their names. I’m willing to pay $3 million. We do need to move quickly, though.You have –
Or you give me the names for free. [ Laughs  ] We really should act swiftly.
Now, there’s a point of view that I can relate to. [ Laughs  ] Yaabari, look at me. Give me what I want, or so help me God, I’ll make it rain fire on you.
Funny thing I recently acquired three hellfire missiles at a considerable discount. If you give me what I want, I can still call off the other two. But I’ll need to borrow your phone.
Mm. I think you do, Yaabari. I think you’ve heard things. Who else has Berlin hired to hunt me?
Orci. I’ve dealt with Orci. Who else?
It’s okay.
Lord Baltimore.
[ Chuckles  ] Did you take a different route?
Change your hotel?
Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about.♤
People love to decry big brother, the NSA, the government listening in on their most private lives, yet they all willingly go online and hand over the most intimate details of those lives – to big data.
They know more than that. They know your habits, the banks you use, the pills you pop, the men or women you sleep with. Every piece of information is worth something to somebody. And in the hands of the wrong person, that could be deadly.
Lord Baltimore is in town.
He’s a tracker by trade, but his methods are thoroughly modern. He’s made an art of combing through cyberspace, finding the status updates, financial records, and location blips that virtually everyone leaves behind in the modern age.
Yes. Me. Follow this, Lizzy. It’s our first lead. If we find Lord Baltimore, he may very well point us to Berlin.
Hello, Harold. Please apologize to Charlene, your side gate may need a new lock. A get-well present. It looks so soft. Shea butter? [ Gives Harold flash drive ]
When are you coming back to work?
Things are at a tipping point, Harold. Your replacement has the unfortunate distinction of being both untrustworthy and incompetent.
I hate sand.
It’s not a threat, Harold. It’s a bribe. That is my only copy of Our Little Adventure in Kuwait. I’m giving it to you only to underscore the urgency of our situation.
You need to get back on your feet. There’s no shame in being a cripple.
I know what they found while you were at the hospital. I know about the diagnosis. Let’s get the job done.
Thank you, Steven.
Doctor’s orders. We’ll be fine. ⋘⋙ I don’t remember him. Find out who he is and put two more men on detail downstairs.
You hear that? [ Indistinct shouting  ] [ Screaming, gunshots  ]
Lord Baltimore. Aren’t you a surprisingly saucy minx.
You’re Mossad. Please don’t tell me this is about that little dust-up in Haifa.
[ Laughs  ] A diplomat? I had nothing to do with it.
Oh, you have no idea how I wish that were true. I have tens of thousands of things to worry about. Fortunately, you, my dear, are not one of them.
Because the person you just informed of my capture is going to release me within the hour.
I’m confident every day.
Your younger brother, Shahin, was killed in the 2009 Pishin Bombing. In Farsi, Shahin, means – Falcon.
I know everything about the people who are tasked with finding me. Your turn. How did you do it?
So do millions of other men.
Nonetheless, this sample was far too broad to be of any practical use.
Effectively turning every earth-toned Zegna tie into a homing device. Brilliant. Just like a bloodhound.
Perhaps next time.
Ms. Navabi. Jundallah claimed responsibility for the bomb that killed your brother.
Are they? 
We’ll discuss it later. What am I looking at?
What woman?
Naomi Hyland.
You need to get a unit to her right now.
Listen, Lizzy. Berlin is coming for this woman. You have to move now.
She was my wife.
Describe the scene.
Let me speak with him.
Because he didn’t survive. He was left alive to deliver a message, and it won’t be to you. It’s for me.
No, I got it.
Where is she?
You’re late.
Three.
Everything was very polite, a few questions, a few answers. Then things got contentious.♤
Don’t start with me, Kate. I’ll handle my business, you handle yours.
Henryk.
What happened?
What do we know?
We have an inventory?
But you and I both know what they were after.
Notify Dubicki. See if he knows anything about the team. I want a report within the hour. [ Cellphone beeps ] Interesting.
Mr. Kaplan, I’m sorry. You’re right. I’m out on the far end of the limb.
Aw, hell.
Lizzy! I’d like to introduce you to my manicurist, Rosa Heredia. She’s the one I was telling you about, who was dating that nine-fingered bullfighter from Juarez. This woman is an artist, trained at the Latin-American school of medicine in Havana.
Trauma surgeon. Dropped out in the last year of her residency. Discpanos por un momen, por favor.
Have you found her?
What have you learned about Jennifer?
Monarch Douglas bank.
The preferred bank of international criminals, dictators, terrorists, hedge-fund managers. They’re headquartered here in the U.S., deposits insured by the FDIC, which places them firmly within your Agency’s jurisdictional bailiwick. They have branches in 63 countries, but their criminal operation is run out of an unassuming little branch in Warsaw. And it is the last place on earth that anyone would ever want to rob. Well, less than two hours ago, Monarch’s Warsaw branch was assaulted.
According to the official statement, nothing.
Everything.
What is it?
[ On cell ] Set a match to it See if it burns. Check if it’s flammable.
Jam. From the heart of the rum-soaked, rose-petal Paczki.♤
It’s a jelly doughnut.
Now? Nothing. Just get some rest. I’ll be there in less than three hours. Then something. The copper mine will have to wait. We’re going to Warsaw.
 Chuckles ] Apolonia.
My darling.
I’ve been dreaming of Paczki. I tried to curb my cravings in this little shop in the West Village in New York, but they fill them with prune jelly. Can you imagine?
[ Laughs ] Ahhhhh. Mmm! Tastes just like Patty Sutton.♤ I must admit, madroja, I have ulterior motives. Little business.
My grandmother used to keep flour in the refrigerator. Why is that?
Oh, of course Weevils.♤ It’s come to my attention that the Monarch Douglas bank was robbed yesterday by some of your customers. And if your customers come under scrutiny, Apolonia, your business comes under scrutiny.
God can’t protect you. But I can.♤
Harold tells me the local police may not be your greatest ally.
I’ve reached out to an old friend for assistance. Kaspar Dubicki’s my man in Warsaw. He’s waiting for you under the Swietokrzyski Bridge of your current position.
I’ve arranged for a small diversion. Just get to Dubicki.
No. You can trust me.♤
Enough with the guns. I love trains. My grandfather rode the rails. Have you ever seen “The General”? Buster Keaton? Oh, my goodness.
Dubicki said the bridge was swarming with police. [ A man picks up Laja and carries her away ] We need to move quickly.
Quite safe, I assure you. On her way to my Gulfstream. I’ll arrange for an onboard medic to tend to her wounds. We’ll be wheels-up in 20. I’ve also booked the two of you first-class tickets home.
Guys, guys. Enough with the pointing. Don’t worry, Donald. They won’t shoot you. But they will restrain you rigorously if necessary.♤ Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have business to attend to. Be sure they make their flight.
I think it’s time we met.♤
I hope it’s been worth it. What a terrible waste. Time, blood, money. And in the end, for what?
Revenge isn’t a passion it’s a disease that eats at your mind and poisons your soul.♤ I attended summer camp with this little stick of a girl Twila Stansberry. Hell of an athlete capture the flag. Had an unrelenting passion for fitness. Never skinny enough A pound here, a pound there. Ran like a deer. Until she couldn’t could barely walk. Turns out she was anorexic. The disease caused her to lose her sight. I’ve never known anyone more obsessed with their body than Twila. Spent her entire life chasing something that destroyed her. Make sure your passion isn’t your sickness.♤
We have a common enemy.
Whoever told you that I killed your daughter. You are finished with my wife.♤
Yes, you are. I have something I suspect you value far more than revenge. Your money.♤
I have the girl. And because I have her, I have control of all your assets at Monarch Douglas. I’ve transferred every penny into a numbered, thoroughly untraceable escrow account. You’re broke. Shh. Listen. Hear that? That’s the sound of your checks bouncing.♤ From here to St Petersburg, from Bangkok to Mozambique. So, my proposal: your money for my wife. You can give her back and we can continue this war, or you can kill my wife and I keep your money.
Lizzy. How was your flight?
What I’m trying to pull? Is that how we speak to each other now. As if I’m some kind of cheap, dime-store confidence man?♤
Once she left the bank, the girl was vulnerable. I simply took advantage of an opportunity.♤
Storybook ending.♤
You don’t have a vote.♤
She gave you the routing numbers.
My wife will die.
No, you’re not. Not yet. Maybe someday, if you’re very lucky, you might wonder, “at exactly what point did I become this thing?”♤ But not now. Right now, you’re just doing your job. Don’t go through with it.
The deal is moving forward.
Wish me luck.
My wife. Give him the codes.
Yes. Thank you. ♤
It’s funny. When I was standing there wondering if you had decided to let me die, a thought struck me. How did you know that Berlin had his money in that bank? At first, I thought it was the girl that she told you. But the accounts would be coded, moved through shell corporations. Layers of protection. And then I realized, “No. Somebody has a secret Santa.♤ A source.” Bravo, Lizzy. When you’re ready to share, I’d love to hear.
What would possibly motivate her to do otherwise?
Lizzy, don’t be absurd. I don’t have any friends.♤
Hello. How did it go?
Well, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.♤
You should have killed him when you had the chance.
You should have finished it.
What do you want, Agent Keen? What do you really want? [ Birds chirping ]
The Indonesian government has finally agreed to turn over all day-to-day operations at the port to a private company. I’d like that company to be operated by the syndicate.
I agree. So I’ve taken steps to change that. I’m tripling our investment.
The fruit is ripe. Niko, I’ve made my decision. The men behind you will take you to your car.
You know, it’s hard to say. I’ve never been great at reading that woman’s emotions.
You want to talk to her perhaps –  some lingering personal questions you think my ex-wife can answer.
What do you know about Paul Wyatt?
[Chuckling] Oh, well, as much as I admire the police for their wonderful sense of irony, I’m afraid they’ve got this one wrong. The man who killed Paul Wyatt wasn’t trying to make a point. He was trying to make a sale. His name is Dr. James Covington. A few years ago, he was considered one of the top cardiothoracic surgeons in the country. Now he runs an illegal organ-transplant ring. His operation, if you’ll indulge the term, is one-stop shopping for anyone who needs a life-saving organ transplant but who can’t or doesn’t want to go through conventional channels. 
Lizzy, some of the worst of the worst are still alive because Dr. Covington is saving them.
No. Slushie?
Oh, my gosh. You have no idea what you’re missing. Try a grapefruit gusher. It’s just like you today, a little sour.♤ Two grapefruit.
Mr. Vargas. Sounds like some shady character in a Humphrey Bogart film. I like him already.
And his offer?
And you think some of the others were receptive.
Thank you, Niko. I appreciate you coming to me with your opinion. But I’m feeling bullish. Keep an eye on the others. If someone intends to defect, I want to be standing right in front of them.
Oh, my God. He wouldn’t stop talking. But I was able to buy us another hour. We need to wrap this up quickly, though. He has bowling league at 6:00.
It’s not.
Remember the time we made barley stew with that coroner from Des Moines?
[Laughing] That’s right.
Titillating. But what Laskin and Russo do with or to one another in their spare time is none of my concern.
A threesome? Interesting. Based on his sartorial splendor, I gather this is Mr. Vargas. Does that even look like real hair?
Why assume, Niko, when I can ask them myself? 
Gentlemen, thank you for meeting me on such short notice. I know you two have had a very busy day.
I hear you boys engaged in a little tryst downtown this morning.
Yes. I understand an offer was made by Berlin’s representative.
What I don’t understand is why only one of my associates thought to bring that to my attention.
J.P., I’m delighted you were able to hold dear Teddy’s hand and help him overcome all his anxieties about me bankrupting our operation.
If I were you, Teddy, I’d be more concerned about the plans these gentlemen have for your immediate future.
Know him? [Chuckling] Oh, my gosh. I once shared a ride with the man on a twin-engine prop from Port Au Prince to Baracoa. We had to counterweight the plane with three containers of Russian R.P.G.s just to accommodate his girth.
Well, B.B.’s an indulgent man. He loves to be surrounded with what he loves the most.
[Soft music plays] B.B. Just like a bear at a campsite. You poor thing. Honestly, I don’t know how you do it. It boggles the imagination.
I suppose it isn’t any wonder you can justify cramming all this grease-drenched gristle into your face given that you’ve already paid to replace that rotted nub you call a heart. How’s that going, by the way? I heard you had a setback a problem with the donor not coming through?
The good Dr. Covington, he and I need to have a conversation. And since you happen to be in touch, I thought you could connect us.
B.B Surely you have some way to get ahold of the man. You’re in his care.
B.B., you don’t look well. Are you all right? Let me guess: irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, perhaps a little tingling in your nether regions?
Those drinks you’ve been enjoying on the house? They weren’t from the house. They were from me. I hope you don’t mind. I took the liberty of adding a special surprise ingredient something to treat any localized dysfunction you may be suffering. Has the little man been falling down on the job? It’s a miracle drug, not so much for a glutton with a bum heart, however. But look on the bright side, you’ll die with a marvelous erection.
Well, the two gentlemen behind me happen to be paramedics. Put me in touch with Covington, they’ll be happy to assist you. What do you think, B.B.? Does this feel like an emergency? 
Niko, you’re all in a sweat. What’s so important that it couldn’t wait?
I see. And you’re speaking for…?
Don’t forget who you’re talking to.
Well played, Niko. I didn’t think you had it in you.
I find chrome to be a bit ostentatious. [ Takes gun from Vargas ]
[Chuckles] You know, when I was 15, I had a summer job installing carpets for Albert Kodagolian on Lake Charlevoix. Horrible job, hot, indoors, forced to listen to “The Gambler” on 8-track while the rest of the world was at the beach. Three days into the job, I knew I had to quit. I asked my father for advice. All he wanted to know was whether I’d given my word to Mr. Kodagolian that I’d work the summer. I told him I had. My father suggested I stick it out. I’d given my word. Worst eight weeks of my life. Until the last day. Mr. Kodagolian shows up at the jobsite, pulls me aside, and tells me that in 27 years, no kid has ever made it through the summer, gives me a bonus $40. The most valuable money I’ve ever made. A priceless lesson about life. Value loyalty above all else.♤ Oh! I buried the lead. Turns out the Indonesian government has chosen to contract our company to run the Port Of Tan Kulu. The Deputy Minister of Transportation was not a fan. Fortunately, he was also gravely ill and in desperate need of a heart transplant. He died this morning. Apparently, the arrangements he’d made to secure a donor heart didn’t pan out.♤ The new deputy minister sees things our way. Lucky, I guess.
You’re right. Luck rarely has anything to do with it.♤ [shoots him]
What?
Give him his seat. He’s gonna faint. Oh, my.
You look so different.
You can’t go back to Philadelphia. It’s too dangerous.
I need to know where Jennifer is.
How much does she know?
Listen to me about Jennifer, I can protect her.
The arrangements have been made passports, identities, a new life. Talk it over with Frank. If you love him, you’ll let me help.
In safe hands.
Solvang? I never send anyone I care about to Solvang.
Did you read about that housewife in Reston? She shot a bank manager.
Violent crime in D.C. is at a 20-year low, and yet in the last four months, there have been seven random acts of violence by individuals with no prior criminal record. Lizzy, what do you know about social psychology? It’s the study of how our behavior is influenced by the world around us. Not influenced manipulated. In what little time I devote to the judgment your government has made about my character and how I treat my fellow man, I can’t help but think about how many of their own citizens they’ve treated like lab rats in the name of science. I believe this murder in Reston is part of an underground social-psychology experiment. Conducted by our government. Strap on your tinfoil hat, Lizzy.
This is a mistake. I can’t help you in Philadelphia.
You know I would stop at nothing to protect you.
Yes, you do. I understand it may be difficult for you to accept my help, given the history that Carla and I share.
[Laughing] Oh, my God. Is that what they call him in Tel Aviv? I haven’t spoken to Haskell in years.
I do. But it’s a sticky situation. Old Haskell and I had somewhat of a falling-out at the craps table.
[Knock on door] Hask –
Haskell, I told you I’m sorry. What more can I say?
I didn’t. Okay. Yes, I did. But you were having such a great time. And after everything that happened with Sheryl and that Cuban, the boxer – what was his name?
Yasiel! God, that hair. Beautiful hair. I thought you could use a little distraction. You forget we won $25,000 on one roll.
[Shows him a suit are filled with $$$] It’s an olive branch, with interest. … My friend Miss Watkins is a blogger looking for her first scoop.
Haskell’s quite a puzzle man. Spends his days combing through thousands of pages of redacted government documents, comparing them to defense-authorization reports, executive orders. He’s found a way to read between the lines. I wouldn’t have the patience.
She’s exhausted. Why don’t you and I go for a walk? This may be hard to understand, Frank, but after all these years, your wife has become more like an estranged sister to me. We can’t really bear each other’s company. But I’ve become somewhat concerned about her general well-being and sense of security.
She loves you. [ Brakes squeal ] You’ve made her happy. Given her a life, stability [ Vehicle door opens ] The one thing I could never provide. Come closer, Frank. Frank. Come here.
Come on.
You’re finished with Monica.
We had a few words, and, thanks to my friend’s rather judicious rescue, we also have a dog.
She’s fine. But from this point forward there is only Naomi. She believes you to be an honest man, Frank – faithful, and that is what you will become. You’re going to accept my protection and leave Philadelphia.
You make her happy. That is the only reason you’re still here. [ Tosses stick ] Go get it, boy. [ Dog doesn’t move ] [ Chuckles] City dog.
[ Has been listening outside the door ] Well. Look at the two of you. I should have brought a bottle of Chardonnay. I have your papers. Dembe’s outside. He’ll need your signature on some of the documents. Frank is gonna pack the car.
Agent Keen. [Chuckles lightly] I hope you had an illuminating conversation.
If you need anything… Ever … 
So, how’d your case go?
Who is who?
Yes.
Since the day Agent Malik died.
[Chuckles] My associate saves your life, and instead of saying “thank you,” you try to get him fired. If I knew better, I’d say you were hiding something.
Lizzy, I’m not getting rid of him. Your safety is of great concern to me.
There was an incident this morning in Dupont Circle. A woman was struck by a taxi Carrie Ann Beck.
Yes. The leaders of The Front.
So the world believes. In truth, they took their work underground. Personally, I once admired Carrie Ann. However, since going underground, they’ve become too radical for my blood, advocates for a level of destruction that I find chilling.
I believe her husband is responsible.
Yes, but their partnership was a tenuous one. She was always the more moderate voice, only interested in operations that related directly to the environment. Beck, on the other hand, views himself as a chosen one, a messianic figure who sees humanity as a virus that needs to be eradicated in order to save the planet. I fear he got rid of his wife because she was trying to stop him from implementing a plan to do just that.
I’ll need all your research.
And any leads as to her whereabouts.
You don’t have any leads. You know what? I don’t have time! And yet you’ve had me waiting out there for over 45 minutes! Do you know the vending machine is broken? It’s as if you enjoy making people miserable!
If you can’t do this, I need to find someone who can. Everything rests on finding the girl.
Is something wrong?
Talk to me.
Ohh, Glen.
How bad?
Flax seed?
I don’t have time for this.
Every time you can’t deliver, you do this. These cockamamie stories! – My mother is dying! Yes, and your brother-in-law had Legionnaires’ disease, and your house was flooded, and I’m still no closer to finding the girl.
You’re the most gifted tracker I know, Glen, but your mouth runs like a scalded dog. I don’t know why you’re mad at me. You’re the one who came up short.
Lizzy, I need to see you. There’s been a development.
Lillian is paid to embargo certain key details from your colleagues if she believes they may be of interest to me.
Ladies, please. I’m surprised the two of you haven’t met at a conference or company retreat. Does the FBI do a Christmas party?
Hello, Aram. Agent Navabi. You certainly look radiant.
I’m not. I’m looking for you.
Yes.
It’s not.
Aram, this woman is critical in my war with Berlin.
Oh, dear.
 Laughs ] The FBI is in the business of my business. Why else would I be in business with the FBI?
Who told you she’s my daughter?❗
I’m touched.
As a rule, I consider jealousy to be a base emotion. But in this case, it’s quite endearing.♤
I assure you, Lizzy, my quest to find this young woman will in no way compromise our relationship.
Where are we on the case?
I understand you lost Beck. It must be disheartening.
It’s about Agent Keen.
She seems unusually agitated. I’m not sure why, but I believe she’s hiding something from me.
I’m not sure.
But I think she’s worried you may expose her.
She’s made it clear she wants you gone.
I told her that’s not an option.
I think she may try to manipulate the situation.
[ Chuckles ] Don’t worry. I’ve got eyes on her as we speak. She’s not going anywhere.
Don’t.
The vending machine is still not working.
The woman grading the written tests needs to shower.
Zoe Dantonio.
It’s a new vending machine. Yours is broken. Consider it a bonus.
Circumstances have changed, Aram. I found what I was looking for.
When?
Where are you on Beck?
Well, there you have it.
[ Red chuckles ] You two out here playing grab-ass in the woods just smacks of something biblical.
I’m the snake in the grass. ♤ I was a big fan of yours at one time. I remember you in that little, inflatable boat in the North Sea, going up against that oil platform, huge waves tossing you up against the pilings, fire hoses and steel oil drums raining down from above. My God, it gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. Then I had the good fortune of sharing a cell in a prison outside Sochi with an associate of yours, Yevgeny Bushkin. Big bear of a man, 150 kilos on an empty belly. As I remember it, Yevgeny went on hunger strike to protest some oil pipeline that threatened a vital something-or-other. You probably remember better than I.
You dig up a plague, hatch a plan to spread it around the world, but before you do, you synthesize a cure. For yourself and your Eve. Ironic, isn’t it. If you were half as dedicated to your cause as Yevgeny was, there would be no vaccine, I wouldn’t be here, and you and Pepper would be free to romp like bunnies until the convulsing and hemorrhaging started.
I’ll be frank, Mr. Beck, because I’m in a bit of a hurry. I’m not here for you. I think you know what I’m about to ask for.
Red: You never told him?
Where is it?
We don’t have much time.
 Laughs ] [ Sirens wailing in distance ] Ah. [ Key jingles ] [ Sighs ] My business is finished here. I’ll leave the two of you. I’m sure you have plenty to discuss.
So nostalgic. The charming and yet tragic naïveté, as if these creatures will somehow flourish if Harlan and Jack can [ Chuckling ] just manage to relocate a breeding female.
Not poachers, Lizzy – traffickers. The poor devils who do the killing are the smallest of cogs in a very large machine. And the Mombasa Cartel is the worst of the lot. They operate behind an impenetrable veil of secrecy, enforced by brute terror and a rat’s nest of corporate fronts. Subsidiaries of shells inside numbered accounts.
Granted. Let’s forget about the animals for a moment The wholesale extinctions, the impact on the environment. Let’s just consider the human toll. The thorough corruption of local authorities, political assassinations, the massacres of entire villages and wildlife compounds. Eradicated for the most base of all possible motives: Profit. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year in blood money – human blood money.
Someday the creatures on that program will be akin to unicorns and griffins –  A fairy-tale bestiary written in past tense, and no one is lifting a finger to stop it. Why not, Lizzy? Why not us?♤
I’ve arranged drinks for you with Geoff Perl.
No, just you and Geoff. Despite being the 33rd richest man on the planet and the C.E.O of Deckard Capital, Geoff is a passionate advocate for wildlife protection. He’s also an expert on the illegal-animal trade. If anyone knows anything about the Mombasa Cartel, it’ll be Geoff.
We’re not buddies. I don’t have buddies. Geoff and I simply share a number of interests. Among them, the protection of endangered animals. I act as a bundler for his charities.
Nothing nefarious, I assure you. Advice, information, the occasional stock tip. One hand washes the other.
There we go. Queen to B4. Check.
Your name is Judy Trierweiler. You’re an activist, investigative reporter, researching an exposé on the Mombasa Cartel. You post under the screen name “Elsa.”
Tonight at La Porte Rouge, Dress down. What is it?
You all right? 
I knew Geoff would adore you. You’re a dead ringer for the last two of his three wives.
More like me than you, I’m afraid. Geoff is a savant of sorts. Married into a small fortune, built it into Deckard. Sits on the boards of half a dozen tech companies, owns a big piece of all of them. Then plows millions into animal-related causes.
 [ Chuckling ] My hat. Oh, my gosh. I can’t believe I forgot it. It’s my favorite. Thank you. I’m sorry. What’s your name?
 Zoe. Thank you so much, Zoe. [Offers some bills]
 Please. I insist.
 I’m Kenneth, by the way Kenneth Rathers.
 Thank you again, Zoe. I am quite fond of this hat.
 Later! 
Was all this really necessary?
You know as well as I this has nothing to do with being followed. This is about being found out. You’re hiding something. Why else risk my capture?
I know that, but you didn’t. And now you’re holding him in a cement box under a no-contact order. Congratulations, Lizzy. You’ve plugged the hole, but the dam will fail. It’s only a matter of time.
Wendigo. What have you found that connects him the cartel?
In the meantime, if you can dig up any names behind Wendigo, Lizzy, be careful up there. [ Cellphone beeps ] [To Dembe] There’s been a change of plans.
There you are – Sean Salter. You went by the name “Ace” back then. You left Animal Underground two years before the Sitka Seven killings and subsequent trials. Lucky, that. But, then, you’ve always had a talent for well-timed exits. Well, it seems, Ace, there’s still some freaks up there living in the woods, skinning people and dumping them in the Bay.
Yes. Horrific. And if that was your endgame, I’d be writing you another sizable contribution to keep up the good work. But that isn’t the endgame, is it, Geoff? You see, before I got involved with your Foundation, I ran a comprehensive background check. All your business interests, corporations. Among them, a rather innocuous shell called “Wendigo, LLC.” Everything looked fine. Shame on me.♤ Turns out Wendigo holds controlling stock in a small but lucrative concern called Emerson-Concorde Imports that you recently identified to a lovely young friend of mine as a front for the Mombasa Cartel.
You’re a businessman. As long as you were killing off the competition, you took the opportunity to clear out deadwood in your own operation. The evidence of your guilt is convoluted but irrefutable. I simply cannot fathom the journey, the moral detours necessary to change a man who cherished all creatures great and small into one who profits from their slaughter.♤
A natural monopoly.
Geoff, that was breathtaking – an operatic perversion of righteous intent. But your strategy, no matter how noble the rhetoric, is betrayed and, inevitably, defined by your actions.
A list identifying every member and operative in the Mombasa Cartel, their business entities, and distribution networks.
Or I shoot you here, now.
You know, 29 years ago in Sierra Leone, there was a farmer named Samwel Zuma who had the audacity to identify several low-level Mombasa operatives to local authorities. The cartel massacred the entire family. All but the youngest son. He was sold to a local ring of flesh peddlers. The majority of children in those circumstances don’t last more than nine months. He survived eight years. He was 14 when I found him. Too old, too tall, too angry and dangerous to be of any further value.♤ He was left to die, chained to a standpipe in the basement of a squalid brothel in Nairobi. Branded, burned, barely alive. So I took him. Made him well, saw to his education. He graduated university with a bachelor’s degree in English Literature. He speaks four languages fluently and can get by in a half a dozen more. He is splendid. His name is Dembe –  Dembe Zuma.♤
You see that, Geoff? That is what a good man does. That is what separates men like him from men like you and me. ♤
[Bell dings: Record shop] Ah, ladies, thank God you showed up. I took a left turn in the Rostropovich. I’ve ended up completely lost in the Chico Hamilton. This is an addiction.
Both, you’re right. Thank you. Great idea. Anyway, funny story – stop me if you’ve heard it. Persian man walks into a bar, meets a beautiful woman, has a few drinks. Next thing you know, he’s falling from a 12-story balcony.
I imagine Agent Navabi does.
I am, except he wasn’t a mere businessman. He was one of Iran’s top nuclear scientists in Dubai to supervise purchase of several borehole gamma something-or-others. And he didn’t commit suicide. He was assassinated in a joint C.I.A./Mossad venture to undermine Iran’s nuclear program, but, then, you know this already. My understanding is, she took a little detour to Dubai for a rendezvous with Mr. Nouri so she could toss him off a building.
I wasn’t asking. But I’m hardly one to judge. George Orwell wrote, “Those who abjure violence can do so “only because others are committing violence on their behalf. ” What a visionary, but, Good Lord, his books are a downer. In any case, the bad news is, I was sharing a bowl of shisha with a Misiri minister, and they plan to retaliate. You kill their top scientist, they intend to kill yours, and they’ve dispatched a man known as “The Scimitar” to do it.
This is not your average killer, Agent Keen. He’s one part hit man, two parts con man.
In 2009, his target was a Sunni tribal leader named Majeed Abd Bawi. The Scimitar gained access by joining his militia. [Laughing] Oh, that’s right! Fought for the man for seven months until the day he got close enough to aerate Bawi’s carotid with a fork. He’s dedicated, resilient, cunning, responsible for the murder of dozens of high-value targets, and, according to my sources, he’s already on U.S. soil.
How exactly did you come upon this information?
I don’t believe you. If the Bureau had a lead, they’d follow it. You came to this on your own, and you’re hiding it from them, coming to me instead. You’d rather see Berlin dead than arrested.
If you hadn’t told me you’d killed Tom, I might think he was your source.
Of course you did.
I’ll be there with bells on.
Anchovies get a bad rap. Try the wine.
Laughs] It might very well be better with beer.
I do, a daughter.
It’s complicated.
 Chuckles ] You know, I don’t know about that. [ Sniffs ] I wish it were that simple.
Have you told him?
It’s okay. [ She groans softly ] It’s okay.
I’m not gonna hurt you.
[Beep] Hello? Dembe, it’s Agent Navabi. We have a situation. [Radio chatter] [Grunts] Come on. We got to go now.
Yes, I know, Agent Navabi. Tell me about this lead of yours.
I have a slight but memorable acquaintance with Mr. Hassan.
Perhaps. Mossad has no tolerance for any agenda except Mossad’s. You’ll be sanctioned for this indiscretion.
I understand. But you may have an even more personal stake in this case – than perhaps you realize.
Because one of The Scimitar’s little-known aliases is Walid Abu Sitta.
Yes. That’s why I brought this case to you.
Hassan! I love this club!
Carbon fiber?
Fareed is taking a rest.
Keep your plum covered. We’re not alone.
I’ve always regretted sparing your life that night in the Strait Of Hormuz. But I see pity has its rewards. Live and learn. You’ve been very careless, Ali.
The Scimitar. My friend here thinks you may know where to find him. He would’ve needed support when he got to the States. I’m guessing that support came from you.I know what you must be thinking, Ali. Imagine your future, the rest of your life spent in a dismal Israeli prison, some dark hole they put you in, bending your fingers and pulling your toes until they forget you ever existed. Think carefully, Ali, because, as you are my witness, that future will seem very bright, indeed, if you don’t tell us what we want to know.
Tell me about this warehouse.
All this running around. Really? I’m so relieved when the people I’m chasing come to me.♤
Agent Navabi, you got my message. We were just admiring the view. [ Exhales sharply ] How did you know? Mr. Hassan provided for our friend before, and most criminals return to the same trough time and time again. Indolence, I suppose. Personally, I make it a habit to avoid habits.♤
Yes, I suppose you can. The question is, do you want to? I offer him to you as a gift.
Whatever you like. Nobody else knows he’s here.
Forgive me. I have an appointment that can’t be rescheduled. –  Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.♤
I know you were expecting Volkov, but as luck would have it, he sold you out to Agent Keen. It’s surprising she came to me instead of the Bureau with the hope that I would kill you. I have other plans.
First, understand I didn’t have to come here alone. In fact, I didn’t have to come here at all. I could’ve sent seven men and put an end to this war.
Because this entire affair, every ounce of pain and suffering that all of us have endured has been the result of a tragic and, frankly, mysterious misunderstanding – one I intend to correct. There’s not much left I truly cherish in this world, but I swear on those few things I still hold dear, I did not kill your daughter.
I’m sorry. Is this the daughter you’re referring to? Because she’s not my daughter. She’s yours.
We can’t leave him alive.
Do it quickly. I’ll be waiting outside.
There were police. Is it done?
Your daughter told me your name is Milosz Kirchhoff. All these years, Mr. Kirchhoff, you’ve believed with the blackest of hearts that I murdered your daughter. And yet here she is. The story was wrong, Milosz. Please enlighten me. What were you told and who did the telling?
The Kursk Bombing.
You fled. You must have had help. Who?
What was his name?
The Decembrist.
I need to talk to you about a bombing in the Soviet union Kursk, 1991.
Keep pushing him.
Keep pushing.
We’re shaking a few trees. There’s been a development. It seems Berlin is merely a pawn who’s been tragically manipulated.
That’s what Brimley’s trying to ascertain.
Berlin will be held accountable for his actions after I acquire the name of the man who set him against me, a man they call The Decembrist. If you want to find the one ultimately responsible for gutting Harold Cooper and killing Meera Malik, I suggest you help me find him.
Tell me you have a name.
What? Everything okay?
Lizzy, what’s going on?
Something’s wrong.
I got a name.
No.
A trip to Moscow.
Milosz, the meeting at Mercury Tower. When it happens, it’ll happen fast before the M.U.R. arrives.
You’re not The Decembrist.
What people?
Who is The Decembrist?
Milos, this you cannot do.
Because he’s mine.
This is not for you to do.
[To Dembe] Call The Florist.
I’m still on Moscow time. Just got back from calling on an old friend of yours, Kiryl Morozov.
To his end, as it turned out. Drink?♤
We had an agreement.♤
I don’t go after you, you don’t come after me.
You ordered the bombing in Kursk. Then you pinned it on me. You blamed me for killing his daughter. Some years ago, a copy of this photo was left on the corpse of an associate of mine. Taking it as a warning, I traced the girl to a man they call The Stewmaker. He told me a story about the girl. She was sent to him by a man she’d never met. She was in trouble, needed to disappear, so he took her photo, put it in a locket, and sent it to her father. All those years spent searching for the man who supposedly murdered his daughter, and it was you. You sat here in this very room and pretended you had no idea who Berlin was or why he was coming for me.
You violated our agreement.
Well, now your dog is tracking a new scent. You. And there’s nothing I can do about that, Alan. I have my people looking for him, but Berlin has gone into the wind. And he’s coming for you.♤
Elizabeth, we need to talk. Now.
Tom.
You told me Tom is dead. He’s not.
I’m disappointed you haven’t felt that you could trust me enough to tell me this.
No, you kept it a secret because you didn’t want to admit to yourself that you still love him, that even after everything he has done, after how horribly he treated you, you still can’t let him go. So you’re playing house.♤
Normally, any intelligence you could gather from Tom Keen would be yesterday’s news, but Berlin has gone to ground and is likely dependent on former assets he used when your husband was in his employ. So it seems Tom may be of some value after all. I need to know everything he can tell you about Berlin’s former safe houses, former contacts.
Please excuse my intrusion. I’m curious. Your father I assume he’s been trying to reach you… Has he called?… I thought as much.
 Hello, Milosz. [to Zoë]: Thank you, my dear. Passports, tickets, – and my eternal gratitude. [She leaves]
[Pulls gun] That’s the wrong answer.
[Gun to cheek] Think harder.
What a long, strange trip it’s been, Alan.♤
All right.
8-30-44
You’ve had a wonderful life together, Alan… The safe…
Untie him.
Na zdorov’e.
Your gentleman friend with the earring said he moved the body. Mr. Kaplan is with him now. We’re trying to contain the situation. You should have come to me.
Look around you, Lizzy!♤
It wasn’t worth it. Not if the cost was you, here in this. Filth.
[ Sighs ] When you love someone, you have no control.
There’s nothing wrong with you.
You are never to see her again.
[ Chuckling ] Oh, that’s a load off.
Call the number. Ask for a houseman. Call the number. $50,000 will be transferred into the account of your choice. $50,000. All I want is two minutes with your warden.
Within 12 hours, inmate Luther Todd Braxton will break out of his cell. When he does, he will steal a classified intelligence packet that contains secrets vital to your National Security. The means for his escape and his team are already in place.
Could be. Regardless, if you don’t move quickly, the prison will be overrun and the dozens of innocent men and women who operate this facility will be subdued and executed, beginning with you.
Not for long.
I tried. It’s too late. You’ve lost your facility.
Why the hell am I getting evac’d out?
Radio that chopper. Tell them to turn around.
Radio the chopper.
Radio the chopper!
That $50,000 is still on the table, Desmond. It’s yours for the taking. All you got to do is help me to help you stay alive.
What the hell are you doing here?
You came out of curiosity.
Your government is being robbed.
The Fulcrum.
It’s a blackmail file– proof of the existence of an extraordinarily powerful clandestine organization. If their activities were made public, some of the most powerful and influential men would go to prison or be executed.
No, the Fulcrum isn’t here, but I believe information critical to finding it is, and that’s what Braxton wants.I’m here to stop it.
No, you need to leave.
They shouldn’t even be here. You never should’ve come here.
I’ll get to Ressler and Samar as soon as I can, but you need to get back on that chopper.
Well, sadly, there isn’t a prison on Earth where I don’t know a few guys. 
How about during a lockdown?
Khan has broken out of seven prisons. This will be eight.
She’s with me. Your idea?
You said, “If you could get there.”
All right. Khan will guide you to the boiler room. Gernert and I will be waiting for you to let us in, then you’ll reprogram the system.
You don’t have a job. You’re here because of what your cartel did to Felix Moralez and my people in Reynosa. [ Shoots him ] Okay. Shall we go to work? 
I’m sorry. The warden can’t get to the phone right now. May I please take a message? Nothing? Not a “Hello, how are you?” Say something, Luther.
That’s me.
I’m confident you’ve got a plan for every imaginable scenario, but it’s the scenarios you can’t imagine that bite you in the ass, Luther, like me here.
Ah. Belgrade. Boy, things got nasty in Belgrade, didn’t they?
You didn’t best me, Luther. You butchered and clawed your way into my pockets, and innocent people died in the process.
ou’re not getting the Fulcrum.
“A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.”
No. Bruce Lee.
You all right?
Are you sure?
Have you ever heard of Bruno Ashmanskis? The most skilled cat burglar I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. Bruno mostly did jobs on commission, but he always wanted to do something for himself, something special, so he got it into his head that he was gonna break into the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge to steal an imperial vase from the Qing Dynasty worth millions – the single biggest trophy of his career.
I never heard from him again. I’d always assumed he’d succeeded, that he was sipping some umbrella-clad cocktail on a beach in Tahiti, until five years later during a remodel of the Fitzwilliam, they removed a wall. There was poor Bruno– what was left of him, anyway – stuck inside a heating duct, still clutching that vase. I prefer to think of old Bruno on that beach in Tahiti.
Mm. What? 
We’ve had a setback. Gernert is working on alternatives.
You’re not going anywhere.
Or just one.
[ Air hissing ] One. [ Air hissing ] Two. [ Air hissing ] Three. [ Beeping ]
What truth?
I can’t allow Braxton to get it.
Cabal? The Group believes I have it. It’s one of the reasons I’m still alive.
What’s the number?
It may be hard for you to imagine, but I once had a relatively normal life– bills to pay, playdates, family, some friends, people to care about. Lost all that.
In Mexico, there are these fish that have colonized the freshwater caves along Sierra del Abra.They were lost. They found themselves living in complete darkness. But they didn’t die.
Get out of here! [ Blaring continues ] [ 💥Explosion💥 ]
[ gasps, coughing ] Where is she? Where is she?
You seem like a decent guy, Desmond. You should do something else for a living.
I’m gonna get her back.
All this, Luther, and you don’t even know what the hell you’re looking for.
It’s not what you think. It’s not a golden ticket. It’s a target on your back.
Shoot him. Shoot him!
Braxton took her.
You will make a mistake and when you do, I will be there.
I want her back.
Braxton took her.
This rig is sinking. If we can’t make contact, anyone here who doesn’t burn is gonna drown.
He didn’t. I did.
This is nothing like Belgrade.
You’re out of your depth, Luther. You don’t know the people you’re dealing with. You’re a fine thief – meticulous and careful – but this is different. You’re improvising, and you and I both know thinking on your feet is not your strong suit, Luther. You will make a mistake, and when you do, I will be there to indulge in the undeniable pleasure and sweet satisfaction of “I told you so.”
You need to look for any known associates of Braxton’s with psychiatric medical training – neurologists, psychiatrists, pharmacologists –
Braxton is trying to extract a memory from Agent Keen. He will do so by any means necessary. He’s likely contacted someone for that purpose already. Find out who that someone is.
A memory she has no memory of.
What have you got?
What’s this?
Let me clarify the situation. Braxton is holding a hostage. I want her back. Every second you waste reduces the chances of that happening.
I don’t think you do.
Speak.
The address?
He’s right. An extra 15 seconds probably won’t change anything, hmm?  [ hits him once more.]
If you’re looking for your driver, he’s napping in the trunk.
Luther, I never thought I’d enjoy having anything in my mouth as much as Petty Officer Virginia Sherman, but this [Laughing] My God! It tastes so good! I hesitate to swallow, and I certainly don’t want to spit it out. Oh, what the hell. I told you so. Elizabeth Keen. Where is she?
Can I let you in on a little secret about Belgrade? I barely remember it. I’d forgotten all about the Deutsche marks, and I don’t think I ever even met Henkel. Tell you the truth – I don’t think his name was Henkel. I don’t know who the hell he was, but this – this, I can promise you, I will always remember. Now get in the damn car.
Is she okay? I’m not gonna hurt you. Is she okay? 
Donald. I have information regarding Agent Keen’s abductor.
Well, Braxton was holding a young boy. His name is Max Orchard. My people have secured the boy, but you need to send a unit. Dembe will give you the address.
The FBI are on their way to him now.
What happened?
Your son is gonna be fine. Tell me about Agent Keen.
Does she remember the past?
What pieces?
Does she know where it is – the Fulcrum?
If she continued, would it be dangerous for her? Could she be harmed in any way?
Can you see it? Can you hear me, Lizzy?
Where is the Fulcrum, Lizzy?
Shh, shh, shh! You don’t want to see this.
What you want to see, what you need to find is the Fulcrum. Where is it, Lizzy? Can you see it?
What happened? What’d she see?
Yes.
It’s not that simple.
Whatever you remember –
Lizzy, the memories of a four-year-old are unreliable.
You wouldn’t believe how much he weighs. Sit.
[ Chuckles ] Yes. I know just what you are. Sit the hell down.
You seem younger in person than you appear to be when lurking in the background on television. Are you a swimmer? [ Chuckles ]
Mm. Then we have something in common. You hire a simple thief to find the Fulcrum because you believe I don’t have it. So I return him to you, defects and all, to make it abundantly clear that you should never again doubt who I am and what I have.
I don’t think you have any real comprehension of the depth and breadth of your vulnerability. But only the one who possesses the Fulcrum could possibly fathom that.
Try me. Call my bluff. Please. Call my bluff. [ Chuckling ] Oh, my God. I don’t know what the hell you’re gonna do with him. Honestly, he’s like a damn side of beef.
I hope I’m interrupting.
You’re not answering your phone.
Dembe did. Two, in fact. We have a new case, Agent Keen.
That’s not how this works.
That’s not true.
Fine. Then let’s work. I think you’ll find today’s most intriguing story on page 20, bottom-left corner.
No. I’m intrigued because the priest is not a priest. From what I hear, the good Father Nabiyev is an agent of the CIA. That’s a crime, Agent Keen. Going back to the Cold War, the CIA has a long and controversial history of using religious figures as spies in violation of executive orders, internal CIA policy, and promises made by every president since Ford.
I do. Unfortunately, he’s an associate of mine. His name is Ruslan Denisov. He commands a nasty, little band of separatists known as SRU. Translated, they are the supreme republic of a free, righteous, and independent Uzbekistan. I told Ruslan it was a bit much, but he can be quite melodramatic, not to mention violent and entirely unreasonable. Politics are his passion, and to fund his separatist agenda, he’s become something of an abduction mogul, specializing in senior executives of foreign corporations working in or passing through the region. He holds them for ransom at prices far above market standard.
Don’t underestimate the usefulness of a nasty band of armed separatists. But lately, Ruslan’s been breaking promises. His temper has cost me and my partners considerably more than he’s worth.
Careful on this one, Lizzy. You have more than just a blacklister to worry about this time. The CIA will do whatever it takes to keep this quiet.
The other one, the watercolorist, she – legs like a shot-putter. She gets me in this headlock. I black out. Next thing I know, I wake up, no sheets, vaseline everywhere. The lipstick on the mirror overhead reads, “Same time next year?” I haven’t missed an art expo in Basel since. Lizzy! Please excuse me.
I promised to help. I can’t be an effective resource if I’m thousands of miles from the action.
I’ll be sure to say hello. Uzbekistan has no extradition treaty with the United States.
Well, you certainly make friends fast. [ Ice cube clinks ] Truth is, I’m impressed. Not with you –  with Ruslan.He never really struck me as a man of the people.
Agent Keen is late.
Oh, that’s a shame. She’s gonna miss the most tantalizingly delicious khorem baklava.
You may be right. When’s the next sit-down?
Well, given your new entourage, I gather you may need my help to attend.
Mr. Denisov, it is my pleasure to be here.
My name is Raymond Reddington. [ To Liz & Ressler ] And you are? 
[ To Denisov ] I will see to it that every one of your interests and expectations are met or exceeded.
I’m sorry. It’s been a while since I’ve done one of these. Did I screw up already?
Agent Keen, in this world, there are no sides, only players.♤
Absolutely not. I was thinking we might get out for a bit. The first day of negotiation is rather like the first day of school.
Let’s go on a field trip, shall we? [ Goat bleats ] 
Somewhere, 6,000 miles away, a group of bean counters in a boardroom did a cost-benefit analysis and concluded that these people aren’t worth the cost of responsibly maintaining their pipeline.♤
So, who’s the hostage here, Agent Burke or these poor devils?
And I can see to it that Agent Burke is released unharmed. See? No sides. Only players.
You haven’t touched your baklava.
Just one bite.
Ah. A Russian milonga. Watch closely, Lizzy. Everything you need to know about negotiation is there in the tango milonga.♤
At the outset, they are opponents. Each has something the other wants. They size one another up, assessing risk, setting boundaries, challenging each other to breach them. A sensuous battle – violence and sex balanced on the blade of a knife. Nothing given that is not earned – nothing taken that is not given. This is the pure essence of negotiation. Not a poker game, but a milonga. A tango. A seduction.♤
[ Sees CIA ] Everything.
Who’s on the phone?
Harold! Good. I want you to hear this.
The CIA – The CIA did what the CIA does. I expected as much, which is why Agent Burke and the other hostages were moved from that compound. The question is why on earth you would share the compound’s location with the very people I advised you not to trust.
Oh, Heyworth is the least of your troubles now. I warned you about Denisov. I told you he was violent and unstable. How do you think he’ll react to losing a dozen of his men?
I have no idea. But now I’m afraid Denisov may not trust me, and I certainly don’t trust you. The negotiations are over.
Ruslan.
Take a breath. I told you to move the hostages. You did. Your assets are intact.
Ruslan, he’s more valuable alive than dead.
I hope that made you feel better.♤ Apparently not.
Bobby Fischer. It was game 13, move 50– rook takes bishop, B5. He sacrificed his bishop. [ Slaps leg ] That’s when Russia lost the Cold War.♤ It was staggering. Spasky had no answer because he had no endgame, and neither do you. When you capture and kill a CEO, you incur the wrath of a company. When you capture and kill a CIA agent, you incur the wrath of the US government. That’s boots on the ground, drones overhead. What will be your answer to that?♤
You’re only seeing the next move. People have been pillaging your country’s resources since time began. Someone has to offer a better alternative. That someone could be you. Ruslan, there is an endgame here that you don’t yet see. But you see it, don’t you, Agent Burke?
Denisov here is so blinded by anger, he thinks this problem started when he became aware of it.♤ But you and I both know that’s not true. Why don’t you tell us about Zhabin?
The CIA put you here for a reason. They violated their own policy and federal law to hide you among locals because there’s a secret they want to protect. Now tell us about Zhabin.
Make no mistake, Mr. Burke. My friend here is still making the bed he’ll have to lie in for the rest of his life. But my bed is made, and I assure you my bed accommodates a broad spectrum of behavior.♤ So you tell us what little you know about Zhabin, or I’ll put you in the ground myself. Give me the gun.
Understandable. But it’s the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.♤
The US government says this isn’t torture. What do you think?♤
Look at yourself. Rich as Croesus, and you let Anneca Oil poison your own countrymen.
Good news. I’ve reconsidered our position. Negotiations will resume immediately.
No. We have new evidence to present. There is one proviso, however. That mouthpiece from Anneca, the one you spoke to? Bring him along.
I may need to have a chat with this Commander Kushan. We’ll come to you. See you in an hour.
Traffic coming into the city. Price of progress. This is Dean Walker from Anneca.
The smoking gun. Ugh! That sounded dramatic. Leonid Zhabin.
Perhaps not, but “In a mad world, only the mad are sane.” Kurosawa. ♤
History, Mr. Walker. My new friend knows a great deal about the history of your company’s pipeline.
Or maybe it is. As it turns out, we do agree on one key detail. Your company’s current pipeline is not the worst thing on earth.
The first pipeline– the one Anneca built in 1988, four years before the current one.
You’re right. The contracts do say that.
Then the Soviet Union collapsed, and all hell broke loose. Anneca paid Mr. Zhabin to orchestrate a cover-up. Bury the dead, destroy any record that the first pipeline ever existed.
Who happened to keep a complete set of the original documents in the hope that, one day, he might find the courage to set things right. Your engineers did better the second time around.
Reparations are all well and good, but the people I represent don’t want you to fix it.
No. The Uzbek people have had quite enough of Anneca’s promises. They want you to leave. Pack up your pipeline and leave.
Mr. Denisov thought you might need some additional incentive, so Mr. Zhabin was kind enough to direct him to one of the mass graves where victims of the first pipeline are buried. His men are on their way there now. I can stop them if we have a deal.
Oh! Yes! Of course. This is the water they drink in the villages, the ones directly above your pipeline. Drink up. Talk to your board. You have 24 hours until we go public.
Commander Kushan. It’s good to meet you. I’ve heard nothing but terrible things.♤ 
His men are. [ ie Kushan is in box ]
Perhaps. Sooner or later, we all must pay for our crimes.♤
You still don’t see it, do you? The endgame. You could run this country, Ruslan. What you’ve done is that important. You brought a multinational corporation to its knees, saved countless lives. You’ll make this country billions. You may go to prison for a bit. But you will emerge a hero. One of the few standing in your way is Commander Kushan. [ Knock on box ] Well, not standing.
Commander Kushan? – [ Knock on box ] 
Elizabeth Keen, this is Claude Hippeau, Senior Vice President of Savillion.
I had an inkling.
Give my regards to the wife – and the mistress.♤
You say that as if it’s a bad thing. Anneca shuts down operations, the victims are well compensated, maybe get a little justice, a new firm is poised to deliver a state-of-the-art pipeline – everybody wins.
Vive la France. [ Smacks lips ] 
That little fella, the one through the glass, his name is Glen Carter. His mother calls him “Jelly Bean.” A loathsome individual who, sad to say, possesses an uncanny ability to locate anything.
[ Sighs ] I presume you’ve heard of Justin Kenyon?
The very voice of reason, the rebel darling of the fringe right – charming, rustic, camera-ready, the perfect spokesman to spin vile hatred and prejudice into treacly dross that passes for plainspoken common sense.
Excuse me?
How do you suppose he pays for those high-priced lawyers – charitable contributions?
So are mine.
Glen, you have found things for me with far less to go on.
You found Jerry Minkie’s wife after she ran off with the uber driver, the one with the Subaru.
You found, uh, the other guy – who was that? – That mobster who was hiding out in Needles. Glen, look, you and I we’ve had our differences, but I have enormous respect for your abilities. You know that. If anyone can help me, it’s you.
You know what? Forget it. I don’t need this.
There isn’t a retirement party, is there?! You’re making it up! That’s what this is about! This is what you want– to see me get all lathered up! You’re pathological. You realize that, right? Ernie’s shrimp platter?! You can’t be serious! Do you even see the irony in that? [ Groans ]
Glen, I’m upset!
[ Sighs ] As I’ve already told you, he said there is a safe in St. Petersburg on the second floor of I don’t know where – a bank, an apartment. He died before he could tell me more.
Alan Fitch.
Fitch!!!
Lizzy, exactly when have I been wrong?
You will not come up empty-handed.
Lizzy, I have gone to considerable lengths to point you and your team in the right direction, and now, due to political considerations, people will die. And when they do and the bureaucrats decide that the loss of innocent lives trumps their career prospects, you be sure to give me a call.
I am not taking you to St. Petersburg.
How do I even know you’ve found it?
It’s February!
I want what I paid for – the location of the safe.
I doubt it.
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ] 
That’s puzzling.
Kenyon’s ideology has always been about vanquishing the infidels and rising to power, not about killing their own. This is a group of survivalists.
And the storage containers?
That was a vase. What about the vehicles?
Another bomb. Something’s gone sideways, Lizzy. [ Object rattles ] Kenyon is the devil we know, but now either others are involved or there’s been a complete breakdown in the organization. Either way, be careful out there.
You’re sure this is the apartment?
You’re positive?
My tone?! I endured 13 hours with you on my jet, 12 of which you had your shoes off. You snored. You insulted my flight attendant!
Glen, the safe! We haven’t found it yet, have we?!
I don’t trust you. What the hell is this?
What? We’re in apartment 212.
You’re not dyslexic!
There are no pills for dyslexia! [ To Dembe ] Get this to Sorenson for a trace on the number.
Samar, my dear, bump in the road I can help smooth over, or have the clouds finally parted and this is a social call?
Agent Keen?
Have you mounted a search?
The weapons.
You have it?
Send it to me.
Oh, that’s a shame. Dendrobium?
Lovely. Friend of yours?
Ruth. Ruth! I’m afraid I’ll need your undivided attention.
Ruth I will be forever indebted to you if you could be so kind as to provide me with the activation codes for the Hellfire missiles you have stored at Justin Kenyon’s compound.
Agent Navabi, what do you know about Hellfire missiles?
There were three of them stolen from the compound. I’ve since acquired their activation codes.
[ Chuckles ] Don’t be silly. We just activated the cameras in their nose cones. I’ve seen quite a lot of activity, but, then, boys will be boys.
Not sure. I have two other views, only one of any tactical value. It looks like they’re in some sort of large hand-built structure.
Funny you should ask – in standby mode, the guidance systems ping GPS coordinates every 30 seconds.
A key. I bought you an apartment at the Audrey, top floor, splendid view of the Potomac.
It’s time to leave the motel behind.
You’ve been many things lately, Lizzy, but happy is not one of them.♤ That motor lodge you call home crushes the spirit, smothers the soul.♤
I once stayed at a villa in Bali with a view of the Indian Ocean. Every morning, all I saw before me was possibility. That and a gorgeous housekeeper named Putu, who used to –
Stop what?
I’m calling on behalf of Alan Fitch…
Who the hell is this?♤
Yes?
Tell me your name.
Then you have me at a disadvantage.
Alan Fitch directed me to that safe. Your number was inside. He wanted us to talk. Why? What does he want me to know?
What is? What’s happening?
A graduate seminar. Was there a slide show? ⋘⋙ We need to talk about the Fulcrum.
Elizabeth, one of the reasons I’m still alive is due to my love of reading, whether it be words on a page that reveal the author’s thoughts, emotions, imagination, or whether it be people in conversation, – to ignore what they say and instead read their expression, posture, their gestures. Lizzy, you’re lying.♤
What if we made a deal? I help you find your serial killer, and you tell me about the Fulcrum.
True. I find them unimaginative and woefully predictable. But I am interested in the cases that you and the FBI have wrong.
The most critical assumption you’re making about The Deer Hunter is wrong. Do we have a deal or not? 
Okay. But your killer attacks from a distance, indicating the predator’s smaller, perhaps unable to overpower their prey. Men tend to kill in close proximity – strangulation, blunt instrument, a knife. By contrast, women tend to favor weapons that can be used from further away – poison, a gun, a crossbow.
Yes, but male serial killers are predominantly, overwhelmingly sexually sadistic. In this case, there is not the slightest indication of a sexual motive.
The Deer Hunter has been active for over a decade, from the truck driver in Des Moines in 2003 to the doorman in Adams Morgan last night. That’s 12 years. The average length of a killing spree for a man is two, perhaps three. Yes, Agent Keen, for every rule there is an exception. Each factor, taken separately, is not conclusive, but put them together and it’s clear – you haven’t found your man because he’s a woman.
Hello, Edgar.
That’s not gonna work.
You have to reschedule the transfer. There’s somewhere else I need to be.
Cinnamon-nut crumble?
[ Laughing ] Oh, my.
[ Laughing ] Oh, I do. [ Sniffs ] Mmm! Be well, Edgar, and tell Lucinda if she ever leaves you, I’d like to marry her.
When I was young, I wanted to be able to dance just like Gary Goddard. I still remember going to the Snowflake Dance and watching him for the first time. That kid, man, he could move. Won the eighth-grade talent show. He was on the Yell Squad. Gary even danced his way into Helen Hummer’s pants, and let me tell you something, that was like breaking into Fort Knox♤ …
… Then in the summer of ’88, I saw Gary in the diaper aisle at Safeway. He looked like hell. Gray. Out of breath, fatigued. Turns out Gary had a bicuspid valve [disorder], needed a heart transplant. He was on the wait list until the day he died. How long has Isaac been on the list now?
Six months? A year? Two? How long is he gonna have to wait?
I can get your brother a heart within the week. Best surgeons, best post-op care, and it won’t cost you a dime.
Because you’re gonna do something for me.
Aram, I need your assistance locating the source of a call that was placed to a pay phone – at 92nd and Broadway.
You won’t need a warrant.
This is the number. The call was placed at exactly – Aram?
I can’t stress enough the urgency of this matter.
You all right?
What were you thinking running after a killer alone without backup?
Yes. Yes, I’m scolding you. That was foolish, Lizzy. You could have been –
Exactly that. Killed.
[ Chuckles ] You were right about The Deer Hunter – he was a man.
Together, we were right.
I’ve already told you what I can. To elaborate would place you in grave danger.
Oh, I think you do. If it weren’t for me, you would have been indicted today. As it is, you needn’t worry about the harbormaster any more.
Nobody was hurt, if that’s what you’re concerned about. In fact, a young man’s life was saved.
I believe I know the real reason you don’t want me to have the Fulcrum.
Because you’re afraid that once you give it to me, you’ll be of no further use to me and you’ll never see me again.
I hope you’re considering the apartment at the Audrey. You must stop living like this.
Madeline Pratt has been abducted.
Foreplay. ⋘⋙ My relationship with Madeline is nuanced. Confounding, yet captivating, she’s a singular woman, and the world is far more interesting with her in it. What’s more, her abductors meet every requisite that defines inclusion on the Blacklist. The Kings.
Not “king” as in “king and castle.” Earl King and his two sons, Tyler and Francis, descendents of a Senescent Dynasty. Their forefathers built a fortune on the backs of British undesirables, forcing them into decades of indentured servitude–  a tradition that has been passed from generation to generation that still continues today.
Madeline has made a number of well-heeled enemies over the years, many of whom would pay a handsome price for her head. If merely saving a woman’s life isn’t enough to warrant the Bureau’s interest, consider what taking down a dynasty like the King family would mean. Every transaction meticulously recorded for posterity in the family ledger. Sometimes, years pass between auctions. They’re never held in the same place twice. The guest lists are constantly changing. This is your chance to solve a century and a half’s worth of abductions and thefts from the Davidoff Morini Stradivarius to the disappearance of Raoul Wallenberg. This phone belonged to a boy in the port of Lisbon, where Madeline was abducted.
Find the jackals who took Madeline and they’ll inevitably lead you to the Kings.
Hello.
No. I know The Palace, You people get within a mile of that place, he’ll be made. I’ll handle it.
How much do you want for her?
Well-played, Madeline. Payback for my little gambit last year, I presume.
Careful there, boys. You don’t want to bruise the merchandise.♤
Your insistence on not speaking, sir, is making a tedious exercise ever so much worse.
You must be Tyler. I hope you’re not as short-sighted as your brother. I could be one of your most valued customers.
I haven’t even begun to try. There is one thing about your family that’s always intrigued me. Statistically, [ Added: 65% of family fortunes] are frittered away by the second generation. [ Added: By the third generation, it’s 90%]. How is it that the Kings have successfully defied that trend? You must tell me your secret.♤
And the loser?
[ To tailor ] Really, I’m all for being thorough, but at this point, you’re just taking the nickel tour.
Good heavens, Earl. You’ve never had any feeling in your heart, but now it looks like there isn’t much going on below the waist.
No hard feelings, I trust.
‘Hogs get slaughtered.’ [ Laughs ] All you had to do was listen. But that’s always been your problem – all that money clogging your ears. I told you to come with me that night out on the Altiplano.♤
Poor choice of words given what those soldiers did to you.[ Chuckles ] I’d hate to see you play the hog yet again, Earl.
I’ve always found fear to be my most valuable sense.♤ But then again, you Kings demonstrate a propensity for having more dollars than sense. [ Chuckles ] Your son Tyler was telling me– “Winner takes all,” I believe he said. I’m curious strictly from an estate-planning perspective. What exactly does that mean?
Oh, the Dinky. No matter the time of day, that damn train is always full of hungover frat boys and co-eds in the throes of morning-after regret.
You’ve changed your hair.
Yaabari. ⋘⋙  How are the boys?
I must say, you’ve come up in the world, depending on how you look at it. How did you manage to wrangle an invitation? Who’s backing you?
Nine. [ Spectators murmur ]
$9 million. I assume my money’s good here.
Certainly as good as his.16. Come on. I got to be worth as much as that fake Xuande Ming vessel was.♤
Sorry, Santos, but those cat’s eye Chrysoberyls are brown, not green. An expensive forgery, but a forgery nonetheless. 20!
That hardly seems fair.
[ Angrily ] You’re leaving money on the table. What kind of business are you running here, Earl?♤
Lizzy, you need to go.
Listen to me. I was brought in through a series of tunnels that way. If you hurry, you’ll be miles away before they ever realize you’re gone. Take the boy and go.
Lizzy, you did everything you could. It’s time to go. Go!
I’m sure your friend with the glass jaw will enlighten you when he comes to. ⋘⋙ What’s in this for you?
[ Laughs ] Funny. Your father used to say that exact phrase as if it somehow excused him from the use of logic.♤
If this is just about the money, that would be so banal. I bet your father would trade it all for one more walk in the park with a good friend.♤
Yaabari, before you exact your vengeance, consider this – I could easily provide you with enough influence and firepower to crown yourself king. Isn’t it time you stopped running through the forest playing army with a bunch of kids?
I knew it. Who’s backing you?
Good luck. A lot can happen between here and Johannesburg.
Can’t tell you what a comfort that is to me.♤ [ Yaabari holds gun to back Red’s head. Red closes his eye and says one word: ] Lizzy.♤
Lizzy! The handcuff key’s in his back pocket.
Someone’s gonna come back. We got to get out of here.
If that hammer falls on an empty chamber, you’ll be dead before you hit the ground. Put it down.♤
Earl. [Picks up Tyler’s gun] Someone should have put you out of your misery generations ago.♤ [ Pulls trigger. Gun goes off, killing Earl ]
[ Chuckling ] Oh, my God.What are the odds? [ Laughs ] [ Gun clatters ] I’ll leave the three of you to your own misery. ⋘⋙ [ Casually: ] Avoid the yard, be nice to your cell mate, and whatever you do, don’t eat the franks and beans.♤
Oh, and I don’t need your lousy tux. I want my clothes back.
You can never do that again.
I’m serious. You can never do that again. Promise me.
I’m not talking about that.
Thank you.
But never do it again.♤
 I understand we have a problem.
The Major.
Not a what, Donald, a who – the next name on the Blacklist.
The Major runs a finishing school of sorts – The most reputable of its kind. He recruits wayward children, orphans, delinquents, outcasts, but only boys and girls of superior intelligence who exhibit very specific sociopathic tendencies. He then cultivates them into charming, well-educated, cultured, attractive adults who are capable of dangerous and horrible things.
Which is why we must find the Major. He and I had a rather significant falling out, and I can’t locate him, which is why you need to put me in a room with the Malaysian Deputy Minister to the U.N.
Of course not. Inviting him for a chat with one of your most wanted criminals would be ludicrous. You’ll need to a http://pic.twitteruct him.
Because he has secrets I can exploit. Listen, I’d snatch him myself, but time is short, so, I’m sorry, you’re going to have to do it for me.
Call it what you will, Harold. But if you want to prevent Agent Keen from going to prison, you need to abduct Deputy Minister Mamat Krishnan.
They won’t.
You need to leave, Donald.
You need to leave.
Let’s have a little chat.
I’ve always been leery of the United Nations. The very concept is comically dichotomous Nations putting their self-interests aside in the hopes of building a global community, holding hands and Kumbaya? [ Laughing ] I mean, honestly, it’s like kindergarten. Do [Did] you have rug time? I did love rug time.
It doesn’t matter who I am. What matters is who you are – A secret agent trained by the Major, working away as a dedicated public servant, when, in fact, you’re an asset inserted into your country’s diplomatic corps by the Sinaloa Cartel to help them get a foothold in Asia.
The man who created you. The Major. Tell me his location, or I’ll tip the cartel you’ve been outed. Tell me, does Hernandez remove the tongues before the executions or after? Please I’m not interested in your business. I’m not here to expose you. I’m only interested in the Major. Where is he? 
I want Tom Keen.
You vouched for him personally, Bill. I hired him on your recommendation. The merchandise was defective.
But he did.
Cut the crap, Bill. You acquired Tom Keen when he was a boy. You trained him to be a deep-cover operative. It’s all he’s ever done. It’s all he knows. When one operation ends, he comes back to you for another.
Mamat and I have come to something of an understanding. He gets to remain alive and well, still Deputy Minister, and I get you. I’m equally hopeful you and I can arrive at a mutually beneficial solution.
Keen’s betrayal cost me dearly in time, money, lives. Some of the people closest to me are now dead because of Tom Keen.
That shouldn’t be hard, Bill. You betrayed me. You sold me an asset and then allowed him to turn when Berlin offered you twice as much. You’re in debt to me. Recognize this rather fortuitous opportunity for you to begin to make things even. Where can I find Tom Keen? 
Well, that went as well as could be expected. We got a lead on Keen and an invitation to sit in the Minister’s box at next year’s Slasher Cup. Cultural peculiarities notwithstanding, I find cockfighting to be abominable. However, truth be told, I do love fried chicken.
Tell her what?
I don’t know how do that, Dembe.
I don’t think I can do that.
You trained him to be deep-cover operative. It’s all he’s ever done. When one operation ends, he comes back to you for another.
I want Tom Keen.
Die Entrechteten. Really, Aram. These misanthropes have been on my radar for years.
Agent Keen is facing an indictment for a murder she didn’t commit. I’ve found us a lead on the whereabouts of the one man who can exonerate her – Tom Keen.
In what may be Agent Keen’s single greatest lapse in judgment, she saved the imposter pretending to be her devoted husband, opting, instead, to hold him captive in the rusty hull of an abandoned ship.
“The Disenfranchised.” They may look like common street thugs, but don’t underestimate their authority. They’re racists masquerading as patriots. “Germany for Germans.” On the surface, they’re all about anti-immigration and preservation of the Aryan race, but look a little deeper, and you’ll find they care far less about white power than they do about white powder.
Among the most ruthless in Europe. Somewhere along the line, they realized that keeping German neighborhoods white is more than politics. It’s economics.
I do.
No, you’re not.
You open your mouth, Donald, and hay flies out. You look and feel and smell like cop. You are what you are. It’s admirable. But this is my world, and you’re a tourist. You blink wrong, we are both dead and your partner goes to prison.♤
Agent Ressler and I were just discussing travel arrangements.
Whatever it takes to keep you safe.
We can handle the perjury count. It’s the murder charge I’d like to avoid.
Listen to me. Juries care about intent. You didn’t intend to kill the harbormaster. That was Tom’s decision. Right now, that judge may think you’re guilty, and it’s not easy to let a cold-blooded killer go free, even in the name of national security. But a cold-blooded killer you are not.♤ If we can prove Tom is responsible, it might just tip the scales.
One step at a time, Lizzy.
He will. This journey we’re on isn’t over just yet. You may have given up on us, but I haven’t.♤
I heard the good news!
[ Laughs ] Precisely. It requires a great deal of courage and intestinal fortitude for a man to take that first step toward sobriety. I couldn’t do it myself.
What’s the ninth step, again? Make amends to those you harmed?
You do any business with Die Entrechteten?
Splendid. Perhaps you could put me in touch with him.
He was assassinated – shot dead in his car.
Since when did a pack of stümpers like Die Entrechteten get access to military hardware?
You know where or when?
Thank you, Max.
And remember– one day at a time, pal.
[ Chuckles ] So, the man we’re looking for is a Franz Becker? The holiest man I’ve ever seen.
[ Laughing ] God, no. I mean he is literally covered in holes. Every square inch of the man is pierced. It’s impressive.
That’s who I would reach out to. Unfortunately, Tom and I share some propensities.
Whatever you think you know about Tom Keen, forget it. The bookish elementary-school teacher was a masterful illusion. The man is an extremely talented covert operative. I’m not surprised he convinced you that his persona was real. Once he takes on a new identity, he convinces himself.
So, it’s ink now. My goodness, Franz. As if you hadn’t found enough ways to decorate that pink hide of yours.
You know, Freud hypothesized that tattoos are a defense mechanism, a way of externalizing some internal trauma. So tell me – what secret pain are you hiding beneath that already crowded exterior?
[ Laughs ] I thought perhaps it had something to do with that recent snafu at the airport. I heard about what happened with your shipment.
A quiet place next to a lovely stream where I can watch things float by – someday.♤ But I do have a certain sway with the appropriate German authorities.mI can get your shipment released from customs.
In exchange for getting your weapons released, I keep 35% of the shipment – a transaction fee.
That’ll cost you dearly.
My evening’s wide open. And there’s nothing I appreciate more than customer service. It appears we’re partners, Franz. So, just sit back and let that tattoo dry or set or whatever the hell it is tattoos do, and I’ll handle the negotiations on our behalf.
Guten Abend. [ Good evening ]
I know you were expecting Franz Becker. But Franz and his men ran into some unexpected turbulence at the airport.
I can’t do that. Elizabeth is in trouble.
She’s about to be indicted for the harbormaster’s murder. You need to come back with us.
You’re damn right there’s a problem. Elias, my name is Raymond Reddington. At the risk of sounding immodest, perhaps my reputation precedes me.
Wonderful! Here’s the problem as I see it. You were expecting a shipment of weapons from an Austrian dealer named Franz Becker. Unfortunately, that shipment was recently seized by the Bundespolizei. If you’d like to have your men confirm that before we proceed, I won’t be offended.
I am. It turns out, dear Franzie’s the subject of a BMI investigation.
You ordered guns from a trafficker who has been under heavy surveillance for the last two months. I’m offering the same goods for the same price.
There is, however, one small matter to tidy up first. This one – he brokered the deal with Franzie. That means either, one, he has exceptionally poor judgment or, two, he’s working with the German authorities. I’m not enamored with either scenario.
He’s not just a cop. He’s with the FBI’s Counterterrorism Task Force, and he’s on my payroll. How do you think we know your guy’s under investigation? Elias. Give him to me.
Fine! That works for me.
No. We came to deliver a message, and we have. ⋘⋙  See? [ Indicating blasted out window on SUV ] That’s why we got the insurance. Dembe! 
[ to Tom ] You know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps.
Yes. And now you’re out. You didn’t seem inclined to leave your new friends willingly, so I had to improvise.
Circumstances change. Think, Tom. I’m the one who told you to go and never come back, so for me to be responsible for your return, you must know I don’t have a comparable option.
She’ll be indicted. Not just for perjury, not just for obstruction – for murder. The local authorities think she killed the harbormaster. She’s going to prison.
Yes, but that’s all beside the point. You know what to do, Tom. Are you gonna let a crime you committed to protect Elizabeth be the reason she goes to jail?
What does that mean?
I’m glad we had this talk. I know you’ll do the right thing.
Now I understand why you sold the apartment I gave you.
Be careful, Lizzy. Because the truth of it is, once you start down this road there’s no logical place to stop. You can see to her education, health insurance, housing.
Pull strings, call in favors to discreetly smooth the path. And for the first few years, it may work. You’ll draw some measure of virtue from being her invisible benefactor.
But that won’t last. It’s all a fraud. That it’s really not about her at all. That it’s all about you. And you’re just going through the motions to salve your own guilt. Look, all the money, all the time and effort, all the favors in the world cannot possibly equal what you took away from her. Everything else is just a nice gesture.
You don’t remember, do you?
The grapevines. The ones you and Sam harvested.
A bottle of wine you made with Sam when you were a child. Happy birthday, Lizzy. You’ve become everything Sam dreamed you would and more. Share it with someone special. That said, it’s probably undrinkable by now, so I also brought you an ’82 Brunello as a backup.
My yogi tells me that time doesn’t exist. He fully intends to live forever, and tragically, he’s not the only one. Tell me, what do you know about the Longevity Initiative?
It’s a private company dedicated to extending human life indefinitely, funded by none other than Roger Hobbs.
Yes. He started years ago. I know because he offered me the opportunity to invest as a founding partner in the project. I passed.
Roger is considerably smarter than the above-average bear, and now it appears he may also be as deadly. You’re aware of the New York state trooper who was gunned down last night in the line of duty?
Not mutilated. Experimented on. The Longevity Initiative has entered the human-trial phase. If they’ve made a breakthrough, they need to test it.
With any luck, I’ll be dead-wrong. Perhaps you’ll have a better sense once you’ve spoken with Roger Hobbs.
[ Who has been in room ] It’s not easy being God.
What’s it worth?
You know my feeling. Humans as a species are untrustworthy creatures. We don’t deserve to live forever.♤ What the hell were you thinking, Roger, even to consider authorizing this Powell to conduct human trials?
You had to know there was a risk innocent people would die.
This isn’t about science, Roger. This is about you actually believing that death is beneath you.♤
I know of a doctor who agreed with you, a relatively young man also fascinated by genetics, a man who didn’t concern himself with morality, humanity. That was Josef Mengele.
If it were anyone else, I’d decline, but for you, Roger, I’ll see what I can do.
Dr. Powell. Let’s go for a ride.
My name is Raymond Reddington. I’m the man who was sent by Roger Hobbs to get rid of you. Relax, Doctor. I have no intention of killing you. You are a potential solution to a problem.
Not your work, Doctor– your research. If you’ve been able to prove that brain cells can regenerate, with time, would your breakthrough relate in any way to the restoration of this young woman’s memory?
And that is?
Yeah. You fell asleep at the wheel.
I suppose Roger Hobbs doesn’t care about your motives or practices, as long as he profits from your findings.
So, what did you say to him, Doctor?
You never found anything.
You killed a lot of innocent people, Dr. Powell.
It’s done.
Nothing leads back to you. Why so dour, Roger?
This has nothing to do with the money. You wanted it to work. For all you’ve achieved, you actually thought this might be your legacy.
Well, maybe you didn’t save mankind from an untimely death, but someday, you may be able to spare me from one.♤
I suppose I should.
I’m happy to discuss the day’s events, but not if you insist on doing so at this volume.
Yes.
The science didn’t work. Powell was falsifying his results. He was never interested in immortality, but you know that.
He knew it was over, so he ended it. That’s the truth.
Fair enough. My interest in Powell’s research was only half the picture. This was always about Roger Hobbs. I used the FBI to create a problem for Roger. I needed the man to be in my debt, and now he is.
Don’t be so quick to make an enemy of Roger Hobbs. You don’t see it yet, Lizzy, but a dark cloud is approaching, and when it arrives, Roger Hobbs will be a very good friend at exactly the moment he needs to be.
Get out.
Get out.
Perhaps I haven’t made myself clear.
He’s back in your life.
I understand what it’s like to be drawn to something that is unhealthy, to a part of yourself that you are afraid of. But I want you to remember what your life really was with him, and imagine all that it could be without him.
Good. Because I have a case.
Hello, Roger.
When?
I appreciate that.
Where do things stand?
Then Jasper will have to be persuaded.
No. With powerful men, one must appeal to their vanity.
Set the meeting.
Good. I need the Fulcrum.
Agent Keen, I’m loathe to play “tit for tat,” but unfortunately, due to present circumstances, I must insist on the Fulcrum. I’m afraid it’s become an immediate matter of life and death.
I don’t think you do.
Those people launched a missile strike on the factory to kill us in order to keep their secret a secret.
[ Chuckling ] No. This is simply about me trying to survive. I’m perfectly happy to put you in touch with someone who deals in shelf corporations, but I need the Fulcrum. Think about it, Lizzy.
Because, Mr. Jasper, you strike me as a man who would prefer to pitch rather than catch.
Roger is quite right. The Director’s latest stratagem is hubris. It has very little to do with me and everything to do with the consolidation of his power. If he succeeds, you’ll become nothing more than his trusted servant. He needs to go. He will go. Tomorrow, after the meeting, after you win this vote with everything that your head and your heart tell you are true.
Yes, Mr. Jasper. “Ambition’s debt must be paid.”
One of my favorites – The play, not so much the man. The man was a bit full of himself. He did have a brilliant military mind, but he couldn’t smell a plot to save his life. Intentional pun.
Pride. The subtlest and yet most deadly of the seven sins. Like the Director, he couldn’t be saved.
Oh, no. I’m the Rubicon.♤ You simply need to determine which side of history you want to end up on. Who are you, Mr. Jasper? A subordinate who remained slavishly obedient to his master, or the presumptive leader of an organization that will be far more powerful than it has ever been? 
I’m listening.
And Hobbs?
Yes, I’m quite sure he would have. But he can’t, can he?
Hobbs was to contact me after the vote was cast. He didn’t, which means he’s dead, which means you betrayed him. Betrayed me.
You need to run, Jasper. Run like the prairie wind, because I’m coming for you. And when I find you, I’m going to cut out that forked tongue of yours and deliver it to the Director myself.♤ ⋘⋙ It’s time to go away, Dembe.
What’s wrong?
Tom.
Lizzy –
Yes. I’m the one who hired Tom Keen to enter your life. Can I explain?
Lizzy, when I hired Tom –
Lizzy. Lizzy!
 Alan Fitch directed me to that safe. What does he want me to know?
 What is? What’s happening?
 Aram, I need your assistance locating the source of a call that was placed to a pay phone. I can’t stress enough the urgency of this matter.
 I don’t think you have any real comprehension of the depth and breadth of your vulnerability. But only the one who possesses the Fulcrum could possibly fathom that.
 Yes. I’m the one who hired Tom Keen to enter your life.
 Lizzy. Lizzy! [ Gunshot ]
 Lizzy, don’t.
[ To Liz ]  You need– you need to find Leonard Caul.
 Leonard Caul. T-t-talk to Dembe. [ Groaning ] You need to find him, Lizzy.
 Elizabeth?
 You need to go to my flat.
 You were right, Dembe. I should’ve told her.
 [ Scoffs ] No, you don’t. [ Chuckles ] The blessing of an honest man.♤
 She won’t. But if she looks for him, he’ll find her.♤
 What are you doing, Kate?
 Keeping you alive.
 There’s nothing you can do here.
 You need to go. Find a way out. I’ll be fine. And if I’m not, you know what to do. But you won’t be able to do it unless you leave.♤
 Lizzy.
 Lizzy. When I hired Tom Keen–
[ Persisting ]  When I hired Tom Keen, it was at a time of profound transition in your life. You’d already left behind the relative safety and innocence of youth. Sam’s care as a father had served you well, but you’d outgrown him. A-and I knew that [Inhales sharply] eventually my life would jeopardize yours. So, in an admittedly presumptuous and ultimately futile effort to keep you safe, I hired Tom simply to be there as a friend of a friend to look after you from an arm’s length. When I learned that your relationship had become intimate, I fired him. I should’ve removed him, but you were already in love with him. And Tom, he shifted his allegiance to Berlin in part to protect himself from me, but also because it allowed for an inextricable intimacy and commitment to you.♤ And so you were married. And I couldn’t stay away any longer. A confluence of peril had entered your life, and I wanted to be within reach, to have influence. I turned myself in to the FBI to point you toward a truth that inevitably you would have to discover for yourself.♤
Some of it.♤
My apologies, Leonard. I intended to be earlier.
That data’s over 25 years old. Much of it must be obsolete.
The Director believes there are too many players on the board. He thinks a bipolar world is inherently more stable.
Well, he’s advancing the time-line. And with Hobbs gone, I’ve lost my man on the inside. We need to find Kenneth Jasper. He’s one of the Director’s closest allies. He’ll know what they’re planning. I threatened to kill him when he betrayed Roger Hobbs. More specifically, I threatened to cut out his tongue and deliver it to the Director personally. He won’t be easy to find. But he’s the best play.
Seeing as how you recently paid a visit to my apartment in Bethesda, you know I have a fondness for the old and somewhat decrepit.
He needed you to get the Fulcrum. He wanted you to discover secrets. Did you discover any secrets, Lizzy?
Everything necessary to convince the U.S. State Department that Lien Mah was a Chinese national who died while visiting the United States and to arrange for her body’s return to her homeland.
A rather clever smuggler, I imagine.
Compare the photo on Lien Mah’s false passport to the photo of Marjorie Lin in the paper.
This smuggler also has business with the Cabal.
The Taiwan Festival Bombing in 2011. The I.E.D. that took out the convoy headed to the Chinese Consulate in Jakarta last year. Another 17 dead. Both were engineered by the Cabal. And this same smuggler was used to transport those explosives to their final destinations.
The détente is over, Lizzy. What you know about the Fulcrum – What the Director now knows you know. By saving me, you revealed yourself to be a potent enemy, a target they will try to discredit or destroy. The smuggler. We need to find the smuggler.
[ Sighs ] That’s enough for today.
You should have let me die, Dembe. Nobody told me about this aimless walking.♤
How gone?
Dembe, call Alex and Barton. Book them a flight to Key West. Jasper’s yacht is docked at the Admiral’s Club Marina A Benetti Romanza. Arrivederci Bella. Barton can pass for Jasper from a distance. Go aboard, take her out a mile or two, blow her up. Dembe will make it appear to be a death by misadventure. Tip off Frasier at The Journal and Brenda Short at Holford Capital. Stock in Jasper’s conglomerate, Century View Media, will start hemorrhaging as soon as news of his tragic disappearance goes viral.
Within hours, he’ll have to hold a press conference to stem the bleeding. And then we’ll have his location, or at least a starting point.
He has two viciously rapacious ex-wives, a Brazilian bull shark of a mistress, and a thoroughbred ranch south of Ocala that’s a bottomless money pit. He’ll turn up.♤ 
Call Hollenbeck in Boston. I want a surveillance team outside that station when Jasper leaves. I suppose we should find out from Dr. Rentovitch if I’m cleared to fly.
[ Groans ]
Let me have your phone.
You’ve made your point, Agent Keen. It’s time we discuss the photograph.
The girl is you. And the woman is your mother.♤
I knew her as Katarina Rostova. One of her many names. She was a KGB agent.
You were born in Moscow. Your parents – Uh, father and – They were both in foreign intelligence.
Yeah.
You want to know. There’s a difference.♤
Yes.
I’m not going to tell you.
I’m not gonna tell you what happened, Lizzy.
Hello, Kenneth! Regrettably, your interview has been canceled, but don’t fret. I’m quite certain my questions will be much more provocative.
Agent Navabi, I imagine you’re knee-deep in pilfered corpses at the moment, but right now I require a woman with your particular experience and training.
Heads up, Kenneth. I’m afraid I mean quite literally. I’m gonna need you to keep your head up for this next part. It’s bad news, old boy. I know. A few days ago, I offered to crown you king, and now here you sit. Well, the road not taken. This is Agent Navabi. She was trained by Mossad in enhanced interrogation techniques. I thought you two should have a little visit.
Oh, my goodness. [ Chuckles ] Remember that fantastic film from the ’70s – Marathon Man? Oh, my God, what a film. Laurence Olivier as the ex-Nazi super-bad guy/dentist.
And Dustin Hoffman as – Uh, I think he was a graduate student, wasn’t he? Anyway, that interrogation scene [ Laughing ] Oh, my gosh. Olivier drilling into Hoffman’s teeth right down into the nerve. [ Laughing ] Oh, God, I can just feel it! The screaming and writhing, the sound of the drill. And of course, Hoffman delirious with pain, saying anything, true or not, just to stop the excruciating nightmare. “Is it safe?” “Yes, it’s safe.” “Is it safe?” “No, no, it’s not safe!” [ Laughing ] You know, he’d say anything. And then that, uh, uh, guy comes in – What’s his name? The – With the great teeth and that hair – Uh Anyway, nothing much comes of it. Hoffman doesn’t know anything, but what a scene. Unfortunately, nothing quite so dramatic today. We’re gonna be a little more businesslike. That novocaine Agent Navabi just gave you should be starting to kick in right about now. So, here’s our plan. You’re gonna tell us what sort of mass-casualty event or events the Director is planning. Either you answer our questions, or we’re gonna yank out all your teeth today.
I don’t believe that. I offered you an opportunity to elevate your position within the Cabal, Kenneth. You declined and instead remained loyal to the Director. I assumed you had greater aspirations, but you don’t, do you, Kenneth? You rejected my offer because, as it turns out, you’re quite satisfied with your station. That’s how I know you’re one of the primary decision makers. Clearly, you are very much in the loop.
William Devane! It was William Devane with those marvelous teeth and that great hair! Ohh, I love William Devane. Anyway, that said, dentistry makes me a little queasy, so I’ll leave you and my lovely associate to the business at hand.
Don’t look so glum, Kenneth. You just spent 10 minutes being ridden hard by Agent Navabi. I’d die for five.♤
I had a little chat with Jasper today. Turns out he wasn’t very good at holding his tongue, so I thought I’d give you a shot at it.♤
Oh, the boy knows more than doodle, Brimley.
I’ve received information from my sources confirming that Karakurt is in-country.
That poor fellow’s an aide at the Russian consulate and a loyal errand boy for the Cabal. [ Door opens ] I believe he’s the one who provided Karakurt with a go-bag upon his arrival in the States.
Karakurt is known in the intelligence community as the left hand of the SVR.
In truth, he works for the Cabal. They smuggled him into America because they know if he commits an act of terror here, your government will blame Moscow. – ♤
I’m sure you will, Lizzy. But listen to me. The Cabal is orchestrati–
There will be an attack on an American defense installation within a matter of days. If I’m right, it’ll be the first of many acts of terror here and overseas designed by the Cabal to further their agenda. We have to stop this man, Lizzy.
Ammonium nitrate. He’s constructed some kind of ANFO IED.
Hello.
Oh, dear. You must be exhausted.
Ah, you’d be surprised. The man, did you talk to him?
Oh, no. Don’t be silly. [ Baby whines ] If you could give me a call the next time you see him, I would be ever so grateful.
According to the missus, always. Gambling. He lost his daughter’s college fund playing Caribbean Stud, left home in embarrassment, Helen’s worried sick. It’s a mess [ Breathes deeply ] You said he was moving?
You’re okay. I was afraid you were inside.
Not “If,” Lizzy. Senator Hawkins has taken the bait like a bluegill to a cricket. And where he goes, the warmongers are sure to follow.♤ Where are you on Karakurt?
Tom Connolly is there?
Connolly made the Harbormaster investigation go away.
You have far more than that.
I’m glad you’re safe, Lizzy. I’ll be in touch.
It always starts with a favor.♤
It wasn’t just your hope, Harold. It was your wife’s hope, you children’s. You were given a terminal diagnosis, and Connolly ends up offering you a choice– your life or your ethics, and you picked your life. What good are ethics if you aren’t alive to live by them?
Now, that’s what’s interesting. He orders you to send them to Union Station, ostensibly to throw them off Karakurt’s trail. And there he is.
And assaulted by a total stranger? That makes even less sense.
And a good thing you did.
Thanks to your desire to protect Charlene, we’re presented with a unique opportunity to find out what the Cabal is up to.
By continuing to follow Connolly’s orders without question. The last thing you should do is confront him. Gather evidence. Build a case. Tom Connolly’s been leaking information to the Cabal about everything that goes on in this place ever since he walked through that door and offered to save your life. You want to wipe that debt clean? Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
Ginger, this is Dr. Lauren Kimberly. Lauren, my executive assistant, Ginger Lumiere.
Lauren, we’re going to have to forgo the makeover today. We’re in a bit of a pinch.
Dr. Kimberly was a tenured professor doing genome research at Stanford when she was recruited by the private sector.
She makes her real money consulting. Costs a fortune. She did, however, let me name a lipstick color – “Fire In The Hole.”♤
How is that possible?
One person.
Think. He bombed the CIA’s Russian section. That took time, money and no small amount of risk. What happens when the United States is attacked, suffers grievous loss of life? Liz: We go into lock-down. The bombing bumped the NTAS level to red. But why put the mission at risk by triggering a high-level terrorist alert?
Well, that’s the downside. The upside is exposure, public attention.♤ Remember, the people behind this went to immense trouble and expense. What does that say about their target?
Not me, Leonard. The Director. What is he thinking? His objective is to exacerbate tensions with Russia. He chose to send Karakurt, an assassin known to work for the regime so people will assume Russia is responsible.♤
So whoever he’s targeting next will be an enemy of Russia, an outspoken critic. Someone people will believe the Russians would want to silence.♤
Incapacitation within moments of contact. It’s quite a remarkable feat of engineering. In my experience, such accomplishments don’t happen overnight.
A customized virus deadly to such a small fraction of the population – What kind of trial and error would prove useful?
Agent Mojtabai, I need a list of people admitted to an Emergency Room in the last few days displaying symptoms consistent with the virus you’re tracking.
Aram, that kind of catastrophic trauma would certainly have gotten someone’s attention. It’s on an autopsy chart somewhere.
I need that student’s home address, and I need to speak to Agent Navabi.
It’s time, Harold. Call Tom Connolly. Tell him you need to see him immediately. I’m assuming at the moment he has no idea you’ve identified Karakurt’s intended victim, which is why you need to tell him.
Because he’ll be caught off guard. And in addition to enhancing your credibility with him, it’ll make him doubt whether or not to move forward.
I think it’s worth the attempt. What’s the latest from Agents Keen and Ressler?
Hello, Anton. Relax. If I had bad intentions for this visit, you’d know by now.
I am. And if I’m right, you’re the same Anton Velov who once led a Spetsnaz Special Forces Unit called The Zarubin Group.
[ Laughing ] Oh, my God. That feels like ages ago. For what it’s worth, I was young. I had no concept of what a real enemy looked like. [ Inhales deeply ] But I do now.♤ Which is why I’m hoping you and I might prove to be fast friends.
I know you’re working with the CIA as an informant for the Office of Russian and European Analysis. Since those agents are tragically no longer with us, I was thinking perhaps you might become an asset for me.
Really? What about?
Did you know Katarina Rostova?
Well, if you were in my employ, I would have to insist you not speak to anyone from the FBI or any other US intelligence agency.
What sort of stories?
They asked about a child?
Dembe, the phone.
Lizzy, you need to get out of there now.♤
You’ve been set up. The Cabal’s been asking about you, Lizzy. They know who your mother was. You’ve been set up. You were there when the Orea building was bombed. They wanted you to save Clifford Hawkins. They sent Karakurt to the memorial to make you think he was the threat so you would secure the Senator and infect him in the process.
You do, Lizzy. I don’t need a test to know that you do.♤ Your mother was a Russian spy, and now they’ve made it look like you are, too. You have the virus. You infected the Senator, and now they will come for you. You need to get out of there now.♤
Tom Connolly’s been leaking information to The Cabal about everything that goes on in this place.
You’ve been set up. You infected the Senator. You need to get out of the now.
Yes, and by the end of the day, they’ll identify you by name.
Within hours, they will all have tested negative for the virus.
Lizzy, you walked into the Director’s office and played him the Fulcrum. You are the enemy. They’re crawling over every place you’ve ever lived and worked, every file and hard drive like fire ants on a grasshopper.
That’ll suit their purposes just fine. Anything they do find, they’ll erase so they can say you destroyed evidence to hide your involvement in the plot. And when they eventually restore what few pieces they do want to be found, they will not be kind to you. You need to get out.
You’re already in their hands. The only thing they haven’t done is closed their fist. Go. Now. I’ll be there in three minutes.
Lizzy, are you out?
Dembe’s on his way. As soon as you’re out, find your way to Illinois and Ridge. He’ll be there waiting.
I’m not surprised. And Connolly’s minions are questioning Agent Keen.
There won’t be an indictment. They’ll rig the evidence against her, parade her in front of the cameras so America can see the face of the enemy, and then they’ll put her away someplace where she has no chance to mount a defense.
You won’t be allowed in the building.
Of course not. We’re gonna walk her right out the door.
Yes. Fortunately, I also have a man at the power company. [ Door closes ] The lines will be cut to both the main and emergency power supplies.
That’s 90 seconds for Agent Keen to get out. With your guidance, Harold, that’s all the time she’ll need.
Stay put.
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
Infecting you is not something they’d leave to chance. They want you alone, isolated. In the last 24 hours, what was out of the ordinary? When did you change your plans, make a diversion?
Yes?
I can’t help you with that.
Your assistance is not necessary. [ Hangs up ]
Tom. Tom is calling to take you away, start a new life with a new identity. But if you run now, before clearing your name, there is no place you can go where they won’t find you.♤
I have an appointment. This is a war that must be fought on many fronts. You have yours. I have mine. [ Sighs ] Be safe.
You want to run them from the catwalks?
I don’t need to tell you there is no margin for error.
What’s the word from Baz?
Trying?
I was very clear– whatever it takes, whatever resources are required.
We get one chance to strike first. We will not get another.
I retained his services.
Harold told me the man who infected you was the virologist Andropov.
I’m a sin eater.♤ I absorb the misdeeds of others, darkening my soul to keep theirs pure. That is what I’m capable of. ♤
Andropov – do you have a lead?
My name is Raymond Reddington. The United States government has placed me atop the country’s list of most-wanted fugitives for a colorful and not uninteresting assortment of crimes, most of which I have committed. That’s who I am.♤ You, in turn, are by my estimation eleven of the best investigative journalists in the world. I’m here to tell you a story. I’m sure you recognize many of the faces behind me. They are among the most powerful men and women on the planet. They are also part of a global conspiracy, a shadow organization that spans across every continent and has for the last three decades, consisting of leaders in world government and the private sector. Some call this group “The Cabal.” The world you live in is the world they want you to think you live in. They start wars, create chaos. And when it suits them, they resolve it. Cabal members will move more money in the next quarter than the World Bank will in the next year. Their alliance effects sea change in every aspect of human life – the value and distribution of commodities, money, weapons, water, fuel, the food we eat to live, the information we rely on to tell us who we are. What exactly do you expect us to do with this information? Study it, investigate it to determine the truth, and then report it. Let me be clear. Investigating this group will immediately position you as a threat. If you do what I’m asking, you’ll be putting your lives and the lives of those you love at grave risk. In the end, “The truth will out.” Not all of us will live to see that day, but the truth will out.♤
[ On phone ] Lizzy.
Where are you?
I know. Where are you?
I’m gonna call you back in two minutes with an address. I need you to get there. I’m gonna get you out.
[ On phone ] It’s me. I need to travel.
Remember what?
Yeah.
Tried to be. But I failed. I never wanted you to be –
Like me.♤
This is us.
It’ll be fine.
Yes.
No. That’s why we’re not gonna even try.
[ Hands package to Liz ] You’ll need to put that on. [ Takes off his suit coat ]
Clean it and torch it. Give my regards to Chi-chi.
Who’s this?
Tiffany lives in Denver.
I’m sorry for your loss, Tiffany.
This is where we wait for the Troll Farmer.
We’re getting a little ahead of ourselves. He won’t be ready for at least a week.
Actually, a week may be nice. I’ll finally get the time to catch up on some back issues of Bass Master. [ That’s pronounced “Baaass” the fish, not “Bayse” the musical instrument ]
I wasn’t sure what to expect.
But you do know better.
We have to be patient.
This city is impossible to get out of now.We have no chance of crossing the perimeter they’ve established. But Washington DC, cannot sustain a siege. The economy, the government, one week, two at the most, and the city will be back to normal. That’s when we travel.
This reminds me of Sok Pich. We were navigating the backwaters in western Cambodia hoping to steal some sapphires from a mine foreman. Got as far as Pailin when the monsoon struck. Took shelter in a root cellar of all places. I’ve never seen so much rain. Winds like a monarch gone mad.♤ All we could do was hunker down and wait it out. But Sok he just made a run for the village. So, there I was soaking wet, alone. Three days of absolute misery. And then on the fourth day, I was overcome by this incredible feeling of peace. Something about being hidden there underground while the rest of the world was being torn apart outside.
You have every right to be afraid. Just don’t let it control you. Poor Sok learned that the hard way.
He died. Didn’t get six steps before the wind blew a blade of lemongrass into his skull. [ Banging ] [ Indistinct conversation ] You’re in a storm, Lizzy. You need to find the peace below the winds.♤
What have you done?
Your phone.
What did you tell them?
You and I are finished.
We’re leaving.
Within seconds, agents are gonna breach this building. [ To Tiffany ] They’re gonna want to speak to you because you called in the tip. Get rid of them, or your brother dies. Downstairs.
Seems a bit indiscreet.
Ah.
Waiting was an option when we had somewhere to wait. Now we don’t. We need to contact the Troll Farmer.
The Troll F– [ Red sees Liz and is speechless ]
[ Chuckles, walks away, trying to regain his composure ] The Troll Farmer uses social media to conduct highly coordinated disinformation campaigns on behalf of governments, lobbyists, corporations, crime syndicates, and on occasion, a humble fugitive. He’s mastered the art of information warfare by creating events, virtual hoaxes designed to piggyback on real public anxiety. He activates hundreds of fake accounts to post thousands of tweets, creating the appearance of, say, a terrorist attack in Paris that served as cover for an art heist. He doctors screenshots from news outlets to report an ebola outbreak in Atlanta in order to drive up the stock of a drug company developing a cure. The Troll Farmer is much more than a rumor monger. The events he creates appear to be real and provoke a very real response. Smoke manufactured to draw the cameras away from the real fire.♤
[ Grimaces. Nods slightly, then turns away from her ] We are out of time.
Hello. Raymond, Elizabeth, and you are?
Martha.
No, no, no, no. We’re not gonna hurt you, Martha. We are, however, going to take your cellphone and lock you in the bathroom, okay?
I must say, your hair, the way it frames your face is very becoming.
De nada.
There’s been a change of plans.
Perhaps I should’ve told you he doesn’t like that name
I’ve had you on retainer for over three years. Your content providers have all my pertinent files.
Today.
Chin up, Chang. Believe in yourself and others will, too.
Fortune cookie.
There was a time in my life when I was quite sure I knew exactly what happened to Katarina Rostova. But after all these years, I’m not sure I have any real sense of how or why she disappeared.
Yes.
Because it doubles the odds that one of us will make it out to clear your name.
Ready?
You have no idea.
Give me your phone.
Lizzy. They know.
I made it through, but you won’t. You have to turn back right now.
Lizzy, listen to me. Take a breath. You can do this.
I’m outside the perimeter, and I won’t be able to get back to you in time, so you’re on your own. You need to find a place to hide, someplace where they cannot get to you.
Katarina Rostova was the cleverest, most resourceful woman I have ever known.
No matter how dark the moment, she could always find her way through.
No, you didn’t. But that doesn’t mean your mother is gone. I see her in you every day. She’s as much a part of you as the air you breathe.♤
You can. You must.
No. Lizzy, no, no, no.♤
Kudos, Donald. I’m impressed.
To give you a blacklister.
The diversion that allowed me to slip past your perimeter, the man who orchestrated that cooked it up in under an hour. He’s an illusionist essential to criminals such as myself, and I am giving him to you.
No, she didn’t. But I’m not telling you anything you don’t know already, Donald. I’m sure by now you found the vehicle that was transporting her.
No. It’s not a trade or a bribe or an offer of payment in kind to entice you to look away. I admire your probity too much for that.
All I want is your word as a man of honor.
You know Elizabeth. You know she’s not a Russian spy or a traitor or a terrorist. You know that’s not who she is.
If you catch her, it will. It will matter a great deal.What you know about her, what you feel about her could make all the difference. So, my offer. One blacklister in exchange for your word that you will give her the benefit of every doubt. Can you do that, Donald? Can you give me your word?
His name is Bo Chang. 65 East Goethe.
[ Chuckles ] You know, as my father used to say to me, just because you’ve been bumped up to first chair in the orchestra doesn’t mean you can compose a symphony.
 Oh, Connie. What a delightful nod to tradition. I can’t tell you how nostalgic it is to see a Russian bureaucrat demonstrating such a time-honored absence of work ethic.
 She’s much prettier than she looks sitting behind the news anchor desk.
 Plus, she’s married to a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Only fair, I suppose, given the black book military aid he’s allocated to Crimea. Reciprocity’s a bitch, right Connie? Screw the Bear, the Bear screws back, batteries not included.
 By all means, do call in the troops. What with your government’s implication in the Orea bombing and assassinations of the sitting Senator and the Attorney General of the United States, how much harm could a weekly game of water wiggle between their ambassador and a senator’s wife cause? Barely a blip in the news cycle. Though, I doubt the Kremlin will be nearly as jejune as I am.
 That’s the spirit, Connie. Service with a smile. The reason your underlings are so rudely interrupting your weekly tryst is because Elizabeth Keen turned herself in to your embassy and has identified herself as a deep cover FSB agent in distress.
 [ Laughs ] Yes, quite. Nevertheless, she’s currently demanding diplomatic immunity. And I want real-time reports of everything– everything that occurs inside that building, especially the names of every drone in the decision loop between here and Moscow. That won’t present a problem, will it, Connie?
 Duty calls, comrade.
 Bedside table, behind the Ben Wa balls.
 Me?
 And I was so riveted [ Door closes ] by her interview with those identical triplets from Milwaukee.
 She’s been arrested?
 Who in the Kremlin?
 Vitsin.
 Donald, you cannot let Agent Keen leave the embassy.
 Her life depends on it.
 You cannot let her leave.
 I received direct confirmation from the Russian Ambassador that Agent Keen’s transfer was authorized by a high-level apparatchik in the Federal Tariff Service, a man named Vladimir Vitsin.
 Yes, the same man who signed the paperwork facilitating Karakurt’s entry into the United States. He’s an operative for the Cabal. Any move he makes is in service to their agenda. They’re not transporting Agent Keen to Moscow for debriefing.
 You need to stop that convoy.
 You all right?
 Seeking asylum with the Russians was a dangerous decision.
 If by “secure” you mean “dead,” then yes, absolutely. Ressler wasn’t trying to kill you. He was trying to save you. The convoy was compromised.
 The best item on the menu is the pecan pie, right, Chui?
 You threw yourself in the hands of the Cabal the moment you got on that vehicle. The only question was whether they’d kill you before or after you entered Russian airspace.
 Carly.
 You haven’t the slightest clue how to speak to a woman, have you? Now, my friend there and I are having a very important discussion. So you just sit tight, enjoy your muffin, and if I hear you say anything other than “please” or “thank you” to Carly, I’m gonna drag you into the men’s room and wash your mouth out with soap. And if that doesn’t work, I’ll cut your filthy tongue out with that butter knife. Is that clear enough for you?
 [ To people in restaurant ] Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm and take your seats.
 [ To Liz ] Now I apologize. [ To everyone ]  I am terribly sorry for the inconvenience, but it appears we’ll all be taking an extended lunch. However, if you remain calm and do exactly as I say, I promise you’ll leave here with a rip-roaring story to tell your friends and families. Bon appetít.
 Dear, would you mind answering that phone? No doubt it’s for me.[ Ring ] 
 Ah. Agent Ressler, excellent. Do you have a pen? Because I’m ready to dictate a list of my demands.
 She won’t, but I will. Ready? My demands are as follows– One, I want the immediate restoration of power to this building. Two, an armored vehicle to transport us safely and unmolested from this door to a runway of my choosing. Three, bring me Marvin Gerard. You have 90 minutes.
 After that, a hostage dies every half-hour. That’s it, Agent Ressler.
 I’ll get that, dear.
 Lizzy, please. Take a seat. I’ll have Chui bring you a piece of pie. I promise you’ll thank me.
 Lawyers find and exploit loopholes. It’s what makes them so loathsome. And Marvin Gerard is the most loathsome of them all. That’s what makes him so invaluable.
 Speak of the devil. Hello, Marvin.
 Christmas came early.
 Are you wired?
 [ Laughs ]
 Elizabeth, Marvin Gerard, – criminal attorney – One down.
 Not necessarily in that order.
 Good God, Marv, let it go.
 I was simply giving you, as a friend, a heads up regarding my plans. You were a wonderful attorney.
 Becky from the old firm? The paralegal. [ Laughing ] Oh, my God. You old dog. Oh!
 All right, counselor, let’s get down to business. I have a situation that requires your undivided attention.
 Marvin, hear me out. You don’t have all the facts.
 Elizabeth!
 That’s enough! [ Panting ] [ Liz has her pistol, spins around and points it at Red. Close-ups of their faces. Their looks at each other are full of dark questions. Red reaches for the gun, takes it from her ]
 You broke his ribs. Sounds like his lung is punctured.
 She didn’t have a choice. What if he’d gotten her gun? What then, Carly? Do you think any of us would be safer if he were armed? You think you’d be safe?
 There will be no deal.
 Marvin Gerard was one of the most respected defense attorneys on the Eastern seaboard. Perfect wife, perfect job, perfect, all of it. Save for his son Timothy. Quiet boy. Fell in with some bad eggs, it seems. Disciplinary issues, troubles at school, drug abuse. Timothy was getting a steady supply of amphetamines from his mother’s shrink– Ritalin, Adderall. She constantly bullied the boy. Marvin and his wife separated. He fought for custody, contacted police, social services. But his wife was the princess in a very prominent and powerful legal dynasty, so no action was ever taken. Timothy remained in her sole custody. Her abuse worsened. Convinced he had no other option, Marvin kidnapped the boy. They tracked him down, of course. Returned the child to his mother. Marvin was disbarred, convicted, and incarcerated.
 A year later, Timothy hung himself. He was 15.
 Yes. It’s the voice transcripts we recovered from the Fulcrum.
 This can’t be right.
 This is a perilously fast run down a slippery road.
 His chest cavity is filling with blood.
 Fine. He’ll be in Agent Ressler’s capable care by then. We’re leaving.
 Attention, everyone. We’re done here, so if you could all be so kind as to gather up your belongings and step into the kitchen. Except you two. [ Carly and Clayton – joke ] You stay right there. Lucinda? Chui, be a pal. Wrap up two slices of that delicious pecan pie.
 I’m very disappointed, Donald. I would’ve expected you of all people would’ve understood that when I make a demand, it’s just that. Stalling is not tolerated.
 Why isn’t the power back on? Where’s my armored vehicle?
 Work harder. If the power isn’t back in 60 seconds, I’m gonna start shooting people. Your time starts now.
 Counselor? [ Directs him into hallway ]  [ Laughs ] The least of your many talents, my friend.
 [ Red’s voice on 911 call ] He just looked right at me.
 I’m sorry you have to burn this operation on our account, Chui. It was a beautiful thing.
Do you like Tahiti?
You’re a free man, Marvin. Instead of facing a notoriously unpredictable parole board and the showering with the boys, you’ll be unwinding on a small banana plantation I have outside of Papeete.
Get in the car, Marvin. Have a mai tai, soak up some sun because I’ll be contacting you soon, and when I do, I want this plan of yours to be thoroughly mapped out. We only have one shot at this. I’ll be in touch. Make sure you have Heia air dry your sheets! You’ll sleep like a baby!♤
Yes. We’re not gonna be able to fight our way out of this, Lizzy. We’re gonna have to think our way out.♤
 I do.
 Mmm. [ Chewing ] [ Light jazz playing ] You have no idea what I’ve offered Chui to divulge the secret of this recipe. [ Mouth full ] He won’t say. I suspect it has something to do with how he beats his eggs.
I wonder if he uses a whisk.
 Do what?
 From as early as I can remember, I dreamed of someday being captain of a ship. To be out there on the ocean in the middle of the night, navigating by the stars. I always thought it would be the greatest life on earth. The people you’re talking about [ Sighs ] – The ones who think they know you they really don’t know anything about you at all. I’ve never told anyone that before. [ Laughs ] About a life at sea.
 It was the Cold War. There were spies to run.
 Sailors have been navigating by the stars for thousands of years. Odysseus spent a decade at war. [ Pouring liquor ] But his biggest battle was finding his way home.
 [ Laughs ] I don’t know. [ Chuckles ] You can’t do every silly thing you want to in life. You have to make your choices. You have to try to be happy with them. I think we’ve done pretty well. I’m not saying it’s easy to ignore the way people look at you. But I hope you can find some solace in the fact that when I look at you 
 [ Pointing ] That’s Polaris, the North Star.
 That’s how sailors used to find their way home.
 When I look at you, that’s what I see. I see my way home.
Change of plans.
Because after far too much time playing defense, today’s the day we switch to offense.
The Director needed permission to have me killed. And he only got it by convincing others that I didn’t have the Fulcrum. That was a costly mistake. And now members of the Cabal will be exposed as a result of investigations. His own people are questioning his leadership. We need to capitalize on that by wreaking such havoc on the Cabal that they will choose to exonerate you and sacrifice the Director.
Our journey begins in the home of the double-bacon corn dog. ♤ Welcome to Iowa.
What do you know about Verdiant Industries, Lizzy?
They’re the world’s largest agribusiness. They sell seeds. More to the point, genetically engineered seeds. In fact, they’re the single largest manufacturer of genetically engineered seeds on Earth, and not just any seeds. Corn, soy, the crops at the very foundation of our food economy.
Yes, and those seeds are very expensive. Most small farmers can’t afford them. Many of them have been driven out of business. And when people feel their homes and livelihoods threatened, violence is never far behind. A few days ago, a Verdiant facility was attacked by a group of small farmers who call themselves Los Segadores [ “The Harvesters” ], men determined to kill Verdiant before it kills them.
They did more than damage a building, Lizzy. They stole data, a cache of proprietary files detailing how Verdiant modifies its corn genome. That’s a trade secret worth billions of dollars. You and I are gonna take those files from the men who stole them.
Verdiant launders money for the Cabal. Hundreds of millions of dollars a year. If we get those files, we have leverage over Verdiant. We have leverage over Verdiant, we have leverage over the Cabal.
Dembe. This is the rendezvous point. Something’s wrong. We’re gonna need transportation.
Dembe’s missing.
When?
Don’t try my patience, Glen. I’m sorry, Red. I’m hypoglycemic. My blood sugar crashed and I just lost it.
Glen.
What did you tell them?
Everything?
Gentlemen. A moment of your time. Eduardo!
You’re members of Los Segadores, am I right? A simple nod is acceptable. Excellent. I was hoping to have a word with your leader.
I don’t believe so. I was told to speak with a man named Eli Matchett.
Eli Matchett.
Gone where?
We’re gonna need Mr. Costa’s address. And maybe some directions. My associate prefers to steal cars made before the advent of GPS.
Then we look for anything that may reveal his whereabouts.
Have you ever heard of Mugs Kalinowski? Lovely guy. Ugliest man I ever laid eyes on. That’s why everyone called him Mugs. Except his dear mother. She was an art professor at Bard. Lovingly referred to him as Picasso.
[ Chuckling ] Well, it was an apt nickname. His face was all over the place. But perhaps as a result of that nickname, Mugs grew up with a great appreciation for art. He fenced some of the most extravagant pieces in the world. He only had one rule. Out of respect for dear mom, he’d never lift a Picasso. Felt it was bad luck. Then one day, he got a tip from a source about a piece sitting in a huge loft in Soho. So one evening, Mugs shimmied up the drain pipe, broke in, and lo and behold, there hung on the wall, Les Femmes D’Algier. A spectacular Picasso. One of a series of 15 and astronomically valuable.
[ Laughing ] No. And Mugs was convinced that was the single biggest stroke of bad luck he’d ever suffered. Well, what he didn’t know was the source who’d given him the tip was working with the feds. The painting had a tracking device on it. Sometimes, bad luck is the best luck you’ll ever have.♤
Unfortunately, no. Mugs had borrowed $500,000 from a loan shark against the value of the painting. When he didn’t steal it, he couldn’t pay it back. A few weeks later, the loan shark shot him dead.
They didn’t, and they won’t. We need a drill.
This is the life, Lizzy. Someone’s always one step behind.♤
He’s got internal memos here tracking some development project called Genesis.
Don’t be anxious. We’re still a step ahead.
Only if you don’t know the four digits. Now there’s only 24 combinations.
Gabriel Costa.
Let’s get what we need and go.
We’re fine. Keep working. [ Computer beeping ] [ Glass shatters ] They’re in the building. How much more time?
Not yet.
The desk.
How the hell did Ressler–
Why would you do that?
Ressler is a law-enforcement robot. The FBI winds him up–♤
Look at me. You need to let that go, Lizzy. I have survived for a very long time now, and I assure you, I didn’t do it by relying on the goodness in people.♤
[ Scoffs ] Some idea, yes.
You seem like an intuitive guy. At least intuitive enough to know when you’re in over your head, so whichever lowlife you’re working for, he’s gonna have to wait to get his revenge. Set it down.
We have to leave.
Pockets. [ He takes keys, etc ]
[ From car ] Hey. Hey!
Lizzy.
Don’t.
You’re right. Thoracic surgeons would be very rare in Fairfield, Iowa. What does that tell you? Focus. Who else would be rare in Fairfield?
 Genesis.
That Agent Ressler may be of some use after all.
And you’re Susan Hanover. Chief Technology Officer at Verdiant Industries. And corporate shill for the Cabal. Come on. Why don’t we let the boy play?
I have some bad news, Susan. The virus you helped Eli Matchett create has been contained.
[ Laughing ] Oh, I think you do. See, I thought Eli Matchett was Verdiant’s greatest enemy. I assumed he left Los Segadores because he wanted to be even more radical, but that’s not true, is it, Susan? The truth is he was co-opted by your company. You paid him to attack that facility. You wanted him to steal that data.
[ Chuckling ] Oh, well, we certainly agree on that. You provided him with everything he needed, including the scientist who synthesized the virus.
Sit down, Susan. Let’s not make a scene in front of the boy.
Perhaps you were willing to create this disease because you already possess the cure. It’s ingenious. Hire a madman to unleash a catastrophic threat, and then wait just long enough for the world to panic.
For the money, Susan. So you and your company could come rushing in with a new product at the perfect time, a seed immune to the devastating scourge and available, of course, at a much higher price.
Oh, but I can. I know about the Genesis project. By now, so do the FBI. At the risk of sounding immodest, I’m on their Most-Wanted list. Number one with a bullet. They came here looking for me. Unfortunately for you, what they found were dozens of internal Verdiant documents which will lead them to your warehouse in Silver Ridge, and I don’t need to tell you what they’ll find inside. A stockpile of new seed waiting to be sold to a desperate world on the verge of calamity. You would’ve made a fortune and looked like heroes in the process.
Never met the man. Wouldn’t judge him too harshly, though. He seized his chance to terrify the world, shine one glorious spotlight on the dangers of planting the same seed in fields all over the globe. Progress. It’s a bitch.
I came here to ask you to deliver a message to your friend, the Director. This is only the beginning, and I won’t stop until his own people realize that their only way forward is to exonerate Elizabeth Keen and to leave the Director to me. Please. Tell him I’m coming.
Yes, you did.
Yes. And when you did that you crossed a threshold, leaving your world, entering mine. Bad things are gonna find you now, Lizzy. This life has a mind and a momentum of its own.♤ That’s a reality you need to accept.
Bad things happen to good people.
I’m sure.♤
You’ve been set up. You infected the senator, and now they will come for you.
Dembe’s missing.
No.
He was CIA?
I need you to find him, Leonard.
Dembe is more than an associate to me.♤ Please find him.
[ From inside ] Aram. [ Door closes ] Surprise.
I’m sorry for the intrusion. I’m here because I need your help.
Aram. We’re looking for a woman who calls herself The Djinn. A matchmaker of sorts, who pairs clients with what they most desire– greed, lust, revenge. They say she can make any fantasy come true.
We’re in a symbiotic relationship. By helping us, Agent Ressler keeps us close.
The Djinn– we need to find The Djinn.
“I am not courageous. Only the poor have courage. Why? Because they are hopeless. To get up every morning to plow a potato field in wartime, to bring kids with no prospects into the world. To live poor – that takes courage.” Ugh. I forget the next line.
[ Laughs ] There’s nothing wrong with my performance. It’s the play. Bertolt Brecht uses the alienation effect to create emotional distance from the audience. I don’t know.
I was completely swept up in the idealism of the theatre owner – a pipe-smoking cream puff of a German named Gerta. She read “Mother Courage” to me aloud – the whole play in one sitting. A brilliant exploration of the politics of war and those who profit from it. Sadly, it was 1991, and audiences were going in droves to see “Cats.”♤ Gerta lost every penny of my investment, but she remains grateful to this day. Her theater is ours as long as we need it.
When she arrives, keep her in the open until I move in.
I have reason to believe that at least two of the people she’s catered to are powerful members of the Cabal. And if we get to her, we can get to them. In case we lose visual contact, you’ll be wearing a tracking device. ⋘⋙ If you’re thinking of reaching out to him, don’t.♤ Now that he’s on the FBI’s radar, they’re likely monitoring any communications. This is important, Lizzy. Promise me you won’t call him.
We should get some rest.
Get there now.
Aah.
[ Entering room ] Lizzy?
What happened with The Djinn? We tracked you to the warehouse, but then you were gone and the tracking signal left the city.
So.
What is your fantasy?
You’re not The Djinn.
What’s The Djinn’s name?
Let’s forget about The Djinn for a moment. I’d be more intrigued to hear about you, Alice. I’m sure you have a story to tell. I love stories.♤
I imagine selling fantasies is a very profitable business, one you are clearly not profiting from.
Oh. Lies on top of pretense, my dear. You haven’t quit because you enjoy the power. There’s no shame in that.♤
No, you do not. It appears we’re all good at reading people. What fun.♤ But, Alice, I don’t think you see that we have an opportunity here to make both of our fantasies come true.♤ The Djinn is a middleman I believe you’ve outgrown. Tell me his name. Tell me all about him, and I’ll get him out of your way. You can launch your own operation. Maybe one that’s a little more optimistic and constructive than the present business model. I even have your first client all lined up.♤ So, this Djinn– tell me.
It’s your fantasy.
It’s as it should be.♤ 
Look at that. Pinned like a swallowtail.♤
Oh, my. No, no, no. Let’s not fuss with that now. Our priority’s to find Nasim.
I’m not sure we should start the party before the hostess arrives, but so be it. Yes. Hello. I need an ambulance. A man’s dying on a cross.♤
Nasim. There you are. Please, come in. We have much to discuss, and time is a factor.
To offer my sympathies.
And I know who you are, Nasim. What a beautiful name. It means “breeze” in Farsi. But you weren’t born Nasim. You were born Nasir– “the victorious.” How ironic. But a boy. A perfectly healthy boy.♤
Alice told us the story. We know you’re The Djinn. And this must be your father. The butcher. Tell me, Bahram, was it so horrific to discover that your 19-year-old son, your eldest son, was gay? So horrific that you forced him against his will to go under the knife, change his gender, to give you a daughter instead of your son, who is gay?♤
For being gay. They’re so homophobic that being gay is a hideous crime, but chopping off a man’s penis isn’t? Honestly, is it just me, or is the human race, armed with religion, poisoned by prejudice, and absolutely frantic with hatred and fear, galloping pell-mell back to the dark ages? Who on earth is hurt by a little girl going to school or a child being gay?♤ Let’s be frank, Bahram. You didn’t change your son to protect him. You changed him because he disgusted you.
A leather journal – hand-written – with the names of all your clients and their adventures in wonderland, but I suggest you find it fast before the authorities outside break down your door.
As a general rule, I’m against the militarization of America’s police forces, but I needed an army, so there they are.♤ I’ve prepared an escape for Elizabeth and I, and there’s room for you, too, but the price for your freedom is one leather journal. Now who’s The Djinn? 
All part of the master plan to clear your name, I assure you.
You want to know my fantasy, Nasim? To escape a hopeless police standoff in style with two sensational women on my arms. Shall we?♤
Yeah. Well, we can’t have everything.♤
Excellent.
Women.♤
He was here.
Dembe is more than an associate to me. Please find him.
You have 30 minutes.
That’s all you’ve got to document it and clean it.
Yes. Get the photos to Sandquist at the Chronicle. I want everyone to know what happened here today.
It’s time for us to move.
Lizzy, we have to move now.
Worse.
Not what, who. Wendigo.
The myth of a nameless assassin. And he’s coming for you.
No one. He’s not for hire. Wendigo is the embodiment of vigilante justice. He identifies, hunts, and kills targets he deems unfit for society. Some believe he’s ex-special ops because his presence is felt but never seen. Whatever his history, apparently, you’ve caught his attention.
A transport team is en route. I’ll call you when they arrive.
To get help.
[ To Ressler ] Fold your hands in front of you. Walk. An assassin has targeted Agent Keen.
He’s better than you. He’s better than me. That’s why I need your help to protect her.
Well, I failed at that. Turn around. I’m a little rusty in the 12 steps, but if I’m not mistaken, step 9 is making amends. I can’t do that without you.
I admire the way you’re dealing with your addiction, Donald. I tried NA once after an opium den in Kuala Lumpur got the best of me. Didn’t stick. I couldn’t get past the requirement to believe in a power greater than myself.♤
What I know about this assassin will take less than two. 
Lizzy, my transport team is on-site. You need to leave with them now.
My people will take you to the jet. From there, you’ll fly to Quito.
Lizzy?
Talk to me. Lizzy?
Aram, what happened?
The shooting– what do you know?
Agent Keen?
Where are you on Wendigo?
You have five seconds. Four. Three –
[ Dialing ]
Shh.
I have good news. Dembe made contact.
No. We have a protocol. He initiated it. I’ll meet him later today. In the meantime, Aram gave me a name – a gunsmith who makes Wendigo’s weapons. Feds don’t know how to find him. But I do.
Hands. Sit. Wendigo, the assassin –
Tell me how to find him. How do I find Wendigo?
[ Laughs ] Would you look at that? . 416 Rigby Mauser. [ Laughing ] And fully loaded, no less. Ah. An African bull elephant weighs 14,000 pounds, and this can bring one down.
Lord, no. I shot the poacher that was about to kill the elephant.
Of course you can.
Grab my arm.
Who’s coming?
Who? [ Wendigo laughs ] Who?! [ Red is angry, pulls his arms away, letting Wendigo fall ] [ Wendigo screams ] [ Body splats ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
Dembe’s here.
Where’s Dembe? What happened? 
We will avenge this good man’s death, I promise you.
We can’t stay here.
We know what it is and why you have it. You want the bounty for yourself.
Who put her on the site?
Who put her on the site?
Thank you for your time.
Elizabeth isn’t safe here. Better call Edward, tell him to get the jet ready.
Get the car.
Where’s Edward?
[ To  Vargas ] What have you done? 
Put down your gun, Elizabeth. Put down the gun.
The fact that we’re still alive means you need something from me. Whatever it is, let her go. My resources are at your disposal. It’s a limited-time offer, Matias. You need to act now.
Call the Director. Tell him I’ll give him everything I’ve been collecting, all the evidence against him. Call him!
Solomon!
Are you okay?
Lizzy, where’d he go – Solomon?
[ To pAramedic ] I’ve secured a safe site less than a mile away – 5243 North Park. Call me as soon as you arrive.
Dembe? Dembe!? We’re gonna get you well.
What are you doing?
You’re not safe here.
Aram; Aram, tell me she’s off the site.
We gave you the name of the man who created the site two hours ago. Have you found him?
Well, we’re just gonna have to kill her.
Aram, listen to me very carefully. This is what I need you to do.
Yes. Get the photos to Sandquist at the Chronicle. I want everyone to know what happened here today.
[ Takes phone from Liz ] Thank you, Aram. That will be all. [ Hangs up ]
[ Dialing ] I’d prefer to know who put you on that site before the FBI.
Borakove, wake and bake and grab a pen. I have a routing number I need you to track.
You look like you’ve seen a ghost.
Look at me and listen to what I’m saying to you, because I’m in no mood to repeat myself.
On the couch.
No, she didn’t. It’s understandable that you would think she did, – but she didn’t.
How’s the patient?
Lizzy, what do you know about Andras Halmi?
Belgian. He’s an econometrician. He develops economic models using regression analysis and game theory. One of the world’s greatest minds. And he’s been abducted.
Andras Halmi is the Director’s most trusted advisor. And has information that is critical to our plan. At first, I thought it might be a random abduction. But thát appears not to be the case as another elite econometrician went missing in Paris 10 days ago.
It’s a small group. Too small to be a coincidence. In the past six months, two acclaimed geneticists have gone missing, two prize-winning civil engineers. Always a man and a woman. Someone is building an ark, Lizzy, and populating it with some of the most brilliant minds of our time. But to clear your name we need to find Andras Halmi. And to find Andras Halmi, we need to find that ark. 
It’s a novel theory, Donald. But like all novels, it’s fiction, We’re not dealing with a rogue nation state here. We’re dealing with the next name on the Blacklist.
The Director. You’ve been ordered to work together, to share intelligence in the pursuit of Agent Keen. I imagine that’s a rather awkward and fraught relationship, one you’d be anxious to terminate.
Andras Halmi, a confidante of the Director’s, is among the missing. He has valuable information I need.
Yes. Without alerting the Director, of course.
Be that as it may, he must not find out about this case. 
You built that awful grotto for that wedding in Tuscany in six days, complete with stalactites!
Yes, but infinitely more complicated. And you ripped it out in a day and a half!
Lives are at stake. The fate of nations. Bribe someone. Push someone around. I don’t care. Just get it done.
Where’s this inspector. I want to talk to this guy. Dembe, the pelican case. ⋘⋙ Marvin!
There’s been a small wrinkle.
Ah … You must be …
Portofino is lovely this time of year. Life’s too short to spend haggling over flex conduits and electrical chases.
Well, who could have predicted that?
Leave Halmi to me. You – find out whatever you can about that inspector. 
The inspector. What did you find?
You must be Lisa. Max said your eyes were radiant, but my God! Mesmerizing. ⋘⋙ It’s very small space. We want to brighten. I love mauve, but a soft creamy yellow will just open up the entire room. We also need to land on cabinet options and millwork today. I’m already arguing with my supplier. Tell me if I’m going too fast–
Oh, my goodness– Max didn’t tell you.
About your restaurant.
I think we need to take a drive.
I know. I know. I ruined the whole damned thing. But there were too many decisions to make without her. After all, it is her restaurant.
Max has been working night and day to get this place fixed up. Alł those classes, the hours you’ve spent perfecting your tarts, your crumpets. If he’s told me once, he’s told me a thousand times, you should be feeding all of Montreal in your own restaurant.
[ Takes Max aside ] I need one day working around the clock without interruptions. After that, the place is yours.
The man who’s going to help you make her dreams come true.
Frozen?
Where is he keeping them?
He has a refueling tanker.
Excellent. That’s all I need. ⋘⋙ [ To Dembe ] Ring Edward. Tell him we need the jet. We’re going to pay a little visit to Crispin Crandle.
No, he’s very much alive and it seems he’s responsible for our international brain drain. He has Halmi. He also has a big problem I may be able to alleviate, the FBI.
And now I’m taking it award. Crandall is flying into a trap. He needs somewhere to land his Spruce Goose. 
Oh, there he is! Sir Crispin, I’m Raymond Reddington.
And I voided it, Truth be told, I’ve decided on a different form of payment. Andras Halmi.
Of course you are. At least the part of him I’m interested in. But first, indulge my curiosity. An ice castle in the sky. he best and the brightest frozen solid. I’m intrigued.
They’re horseshoe crabs.
That’s how you made your fortune.
Everyone dies, Mr Crandall.
Are you a gambling man, Crispin?
[ Laughing ] Ÿes. Well, I agree with you there. But perhaps you’re familiar with the old saw, “You can’t beat the house.” No matter how many how many poor souls you turn into Popsicles, the fix is in. The world in which you awaken will be one incapable of sustaining human life. And why, because at a critical turning point, one tragically quixotic megalomaniac cannibalized humanity of the very minds thát might have been its salvation. You see, if you were a betting man that you would see that “now” trumps “later” every time. The future is a sucker’s bet. A maybe, a contingency, a what-if. The only thing that is real is the present and you have plundered it. Robbed it of the very geniuses that might have averted the dystopia you so fear. Indeed, maybe even the very one who might have devised a means to revive your sad, tired frozen ass. Congratulations, Crispin. You’ve doubled down on extinction.
It won’t work.
Ah! So you are a gambling man. Let’s place that bet, shall we?  [ Shoots him💥]
[ Leaving ] Dead? Pishposh. What’s death? It’s just a process, right?
Hello, Peter. I hope I’m not interrupting cocktails with Lynda.
Yes, it certainly is celebratory drinks here, so I’ll be brief. I think it’s about time to exonerate Elizabeth Keen.
Oh, but it is. The only question is whether you’ll live to see the day. If I continue to dismantle the Cabal, they’ll put a bullet in your head just to mitigate their losses. Everything is working according to plan, Peter.
Peter. You’ve been skimming from the company till, stealing millions in anticipation of running away. When you were linked to the Cabal, you reached out to Halmi – put your golden parachute in a secret account only he could access. Except now I’ve got it. You have no money to escape the inevitable. Your colleagues will abandon you. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but soon enough, because I’m not going to stop until they do.
It’s one small chance to save your life.
I’m going to bring this whole damn thing down on you, Peter. And when I do, your own people will beg me to kill you to stop the bleeding.
You’ve been stealing millions in anticipation of running away. I’m going to bring this whole damn thing down on you, Peter.
So, the rumors were true.
“🍑 Do I dare to eat a peach?” I may as well live dangerously.
Drinking your bellinis.
And I told you I’m not willing to take no for an answer. Set the meeting, and I’ll consider your debt from Caracas as paid in full.
Zal Bin Hasaan. What if I could deliver him to you? A gift for your employer.
Is that a yes or a no?
[ Finishing orange juice ] Ahh. All we have to do now is find him.
With a little help from our friends.
[ On phone ] Agent Navabi. May I assume you’re aware of the recent abductions?
Perhaps. But they don’t share the same personal investment that you have in today’s events.
Because you and I both know that Lazarum Systems International is providing technical expertise to Israel’s missile-defense shield. They’re encrypting software for the Iron Dome. Whoever took those contractors is an enemy of Israel.
Let me shorten it – Zal Bin Hasaan. Imagine The man who’s killed more Mossad agents than any other assassin in history, right here on American soil.
That’s what you thought in Cairo. He was right behind you, and you didn’t know it. That mistake cost your partner his life and put you in an Egyptian I.C.U. But back then, you were missing one critical element that would have made all the difference – me.
That we combine our efforts. We both want Hasaan. I’ll be in touch.
Hasaan?
Shahin is alive?
Samar, listen to me. If I had known Hasaan was holding Shahin, I would have told you. How is he?
And Hasaan?
If Hasaan is in the country, he was smuggled in like contraband. I’ll phone a friend, see if I can find the rum runner he hired.
[Laughing] Oh, my. Three questions in not even as many seconds. Which should we answer first? Actually, how about this I’ll ask a few questions first, and then we can get to whatever’s on your mind.
I knew a guy that happened to all the time. Best glass-smith in New England. Nobody could free-blow a vase like Theodore Bundy. Can you imagine? Ted Bundy, an amazing craftsman, couldn’t sell a vase.
Is she right, Farzin? – I could blow off a kneecap.
Don’t feel bad, Farzin. You’re a smuggler, not a fighter.
That’s not a good idea.
Who are you?
Four years ago, Hasaan bombed a synagogue in Buenos Aires, killed 31 people 14 women and children. Hasaan walked away with third-degree burns on his back.
Fine. I just wanted to talk, but listen, it’s your funeral.
Who is he?
Then why pretend?
[ On phone ] Samar, you need to secure the hostages and clear the facility.
Now. The man you lost is not Hasaan. The real Hasaan is there in the building. The Lazarum abduction was a Trojan Horse. You need to get out of there now.
[ On phone ] Tell me what’s happening.
I’m sorry, Samar. I’m getting to the truth a little too late.
For the list – The list of Mossad agents and their informants working around the world to find and execute Hasaan.
Where?
If that’s where the list is, that’s where Hasaan is going. In a few minutes, half the federal agents in Washington will have that building surrounded. Your only job for now is to stay alive.
According to legend, a great and wise bird raised the young warrior Zal in her nest atop the highest peak of Damavand. When he came of age, she gave him a plume of her radiant feathers to burn if he was ever in desperate need, and she would come to his aid. Pity. You seem to be fresh out of feathers.
Well, another spin of the bottle in Melanie Reichman’s basement, but I’ll settle for you.
That’s your decision. You can turn him in. You know what will happen – Rendition, hunger strikes, eventually death in whatever hellhole he’s thrown into. Or you can give him to me. The best I can offer is death with a purpose.
Agent Keen’s freedom.
I’ll be in touch when I’m ready.
Harold, Agent Keen tells me – you have the man they call Karakurt.
Don’t. I have a better idea.
This is a perilously fast run down a slippery road. You’d have to hit all green lights, but we could make it work.
Does anything appear out of the ordinary?
You will be in less than an hour. Oh, and don’t forget that other matter we discussed. [ Hangs up]
Ian has a first edition of Life On The Mississippi for me. Multitasking.
Have I ever told you the story about Ian Bartleby and his wife and the beekeeper they fell into bed with on the Isle of Skye? Fascinating, illuminating story.
Yes. Freshen up. I’ll fill the tank. Get us something to eat. Lizzy We’re very close. This’ll all be over soon.
Let me see if I can guess how this works.You grab hapless motorists, drain their ATM accounts, max out their credit cards, and dump them by the side of the road. Money or your life.
No doubt worth considerably less now. [ T-Bone lunges toward Red but is stopped by Cash, who is laughing ]
There’s more than that, if we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
Yeah, that’s what I am, Cash. I’m on the lam.
I was wondering when we’d get to that.
Oh, that’ll be fun, Jilly. Cucumber sandwiches?
How delicious.
Two, please.
Kenneth.
Kenneth. [ Jilly pulls the head off a doll and lunges onto Red, pressing a sharp letter opener to his jugular ]
Now look what you’ve done. You spilled all the tea, dear.
You like getting hurt, Jilly. You wouldn’t be here with them if you didn’t.
I do.
You didn’t find anything. Jilly found it ’cause you’re too dense to even look for it. No wonder Cash doesn’t trust you with anything more important than babysitting.
You are aware you need to clean and oil these from time to time, right?♤
You sure it didn’t hit an organ? Looks pretty close to a kidney– ♤
Then again, you bleed out, one less person who gets a cut of my money.
You’ going into shock.You’ve lost too much blood. The body’s beginning to shut down.
When’s the last time you got any of that, Pablo? Or have you?
But not with Jasper, apparently.
Oh, it is very much my business. As a matter of fact, Pablo, our operations are remarkably similar, albeit mine functions on a somewhat grander scale, certainly more hygienic. But at the end of the day, it all boils down to the same basic principle. We steal from others, but not from each other.♤
Kill me? That’ll fix things. At least until those two decide a two-way split makes more sense than four. Tell me something. Do you trust Cash? Do you trust him with your life? [ Cellphone ringing ]
What do you think is actually going on here?
You sure this is about me? I’m worth a lot more to them than you are. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if I were to walk out of these woods alive and I sincerely doubt you’ll be as lucky.
See, this is why I don’t go to family reunions. Aunt Lucile is always arguing with Buddy, Uncle Scott is drunk by noon, and someone’s hand is always in the wrong cookie jar.
Elizabeth, don’t!
Elizabeth. Are you all right? Do not do this. Do not give it to them.
You are in desperate need of some help, Jilly.
Lizzy, where are you? Where are you? – They’re coming.
Agent Keen tells me you have Karakurt.
Don’t. I have a better idea.
I’ll be in touch when I’m ready.
Where is she?
Your measures will fail. Mine won’t.♡
There are no beatings here, Donald. No winners or losers. There is only Agent Keen’s life. I have been working on a meticulous campaign to clear her name. But I need a day to put one final piece in place.
But you’re about to witness the full force of a shadow government working in concert to crush you. And now that they know you have Elizabeth, they will stop at nothing to steal her. You and Agents Navabi and Mojtabai must remain by her side and guard her with your lives – until you hear from me again.
Then it’s all on you, Donald. Keep them away from Agent Keen. And, Donald, I assume you have Dembe and are being hospitable.
Have you heard about Agent Keen?
Listen to me, Aram. The Cabal will come for her. If they reach her, it’ll be the last time you ever see Elizabeth again. At this point, only one person can keep her alive. You.
Agent Ressler. How’s our girl?
Slow down and tell me what’s happening.
I’ve always believed luck to be a function of intent♤–  in this case, mine. When these dark clouds were gathering, I took measures to keep Agent Keen safe to ride out the storm. Are you ready to do your part now?
I’ll take that as a yes. The best way you can help is by continuing to guard Elizabeth. And when the time comes, make sure Karakurt reaches the FBI safely.
He’s agreed to confess his sins to the US government, including the ones he committed on behalf of the Cabal to frame Agent Keen. Cooper and Tom Keen are holding Karakurt in a cabin near Lake Yvonne. I can have him in the city within the hour.
He tried to tell you, Donald. You didn’t listen. Apparently, you have a disregard for Tom Keen that exceeds even my own. I have to meet someone. Remember, guard Elizabeth and keep Karakurt alive.
[To Samar ] Donald. I find him so stiff so much of the time. He doesn’t appreciate life’s trimmings. Take yourself, for example. It’s my understand he fired you for helping Elizabeth come to my rescue.
Watch out. That’s the kind of spirit that could save America.♤ Thank you for meeting me, Samar.
We’re going to clear Elizabeth’s name. It’ll involve a sizable drug haul, an FBI heist in the US Treasury Department. But first, I need to make an appointment.
With the Foreign Minister of Venezuela.
Rafael!
[ Laughs ] Rafael
Oh! [ Lowered voice ] It’s time to meet with your boss. I need to meet with him today.
Oh. Ooh! This is for you. Happy birthday.
My goodness. Well, time flies when you’re on the run.♤ Please, let’s get out of the open.
You see that lovely woman there? The one with the camera?
She’s a stringer for UPI. Dear, dear friend. Shoots my Christmas card every year. She has a wonderful eye for composition and detail. An intuitive sense of timing to capture the moment. A warm embrace between old friends. The exchange of a gift. The intimacy of a quiet conversation in the backseat of a car. But the curious thing is, pictures never tell the whole story. For instance, the only story here will be your friendly meeting with an international criminal wanted by the FBI, Interpol. I wonder how long you’ll survive once that story hits the Venezuelan press? [ Laughing ] I’m sorry. I can’t help myself. It’s a photo album for your press clippings. Rafael, the meeting with the Foreign Minister will happen today.
The Foreign Minister will be making a fuel stop at Kirby heliport at 3:00 PM today. I’ll have 15 minutes with him.
Rendezvous will be fruitless unless we can retrieve a certain care package. The FBI took it into custody this morning. That package is the ticket to Elizabeth’s freedom.
El Dorado.
It was never a city. When Spanish explorers reached South America, they heard stories about a gold-dusted tribal chief dumping vast piles of treasure into Lake Guatavita as an offering. The Spaniards actually drained the lake. Of course, all they found was a handful of trinkets. So they killed all the natives, and El Dorado came to represent the fantasy of boundless wealth – and that is what’s inside the package.
You will, once we steal it from the FBI.
How much time do we have?
We need to intercept them before they reach their field office. The trick is to purloin the package without them knowing we’ve taken it. For that, we need more stolen evidence.
I keep a storage locker filled with useful items – in most states.[ Switch clicks ] Two or three in the Red States.
Bistecca alla Fiorentina, sourced from a breed of cattle in southern Tuscany. The ultimate expression of beef, with a bowl of fagioli, a ’96, ’97 Barolo. These need another month to cure.
Drug dealer? Absolutely not. Well, not really. I’ve made a rather healthy investment in a consortium that supplies medical marijuana to facilities in Colorado, Oregon, Washington, District of Columbia. But simply as an effort to diversify into more legitimate businesses.
This is fun. Who had the pleasure?
Just like my uncle Vic on a Saturday night.
Sorry about the short notice, Morgan. [ Car doors close ] Chuck. Nice paint job. Thanks. Careful. It’s still wet.
Thank you, guys. Time to run. [ To Samar ] As soon as you get the package, bring it straight to Kirby heliport. The plan hinges on that package.
Mr.Foreign Minister, thank you for altering your itinerary to meet me. And how is El Presidente?
Indeed. I believe I can help your President’s stomach condition.
No, but I can give you some walking-around money.
Why, to stick it to the United States, of course. They’ve been trying to topple your regime for years.
Diaz, I told you I could put money back in Venezuela’s Central Bank.
Do you know the story of El Dorado?
Thank you, my dear.
Those are chromium-plated master-printing plates for the $100 bill, created using the US Treasury Department’s own software upgrades plate design, encoding techniques–
 [ Laughing ] Oh, well There was this plane that fell out of the sky, a group of anti-capitalists. Terrorists in funny masks. But I digress. The point is I’m giving El Jefe the ability to print as much money as he’d like to print.
I’ve been called worse.
Come closer, Aram.
Not at the moment.
There are foundational elements in our lives. People that form the brick and mortar of who we are. People that are so deeply imbedded that we take their existence for granted until suddenly, they’re not there. And we collapse into rubble. I’ve stood over the open grave of someone I’ve loved too often. Once for my mother. And then the others. I needed to recall this feeling because I’d be staring at another body right now if not for you, Aram. It wasn’t weakness that prevented you from watching your friend die today. It was hope, and thank heavens you were in a hopeful mood.♤ You saved Elizabeth. I’m forever in your debt. Now gather your team. It’s time to take down the Cabal.♤
Guard Elizabeth and when the time comes, make sure Karakurt reaches the FBI safely.
The ability to print as much money as he’d like to print.
Gather your team. It’s time to take down the Cabal.
Hello, Harold. You look pretty well, considering. Thank you all for coming. I apologize for the security protocols, but my better half insists. Just the fact that you are all here is a testament to the deep concern we share for Elizabeth Keen’s safety and well-being.
See, this is why I don’t play well with partners. Don’t fret, Harold. I’m holding all the trumps. I’ll be the declarer, you be the dummy, and we’ll win the hand. Anything else? Good. Let’s begin.
Yes.
Agreed. That’s why I have something in mind that’s infinitely more persuasive than ransom.
I’m actually a great proponent of marital therapy. Worked for me. Then again, I had sort of a thing for the therapist. Lovely voice.♤
The Director’s wife is a pill popper – downers mainly, to deal with panic attacks and anxiety. They see a psychiatrist every Wednesday morning, Doctor Oren Huffnagel.
The Director takes a scaled-down security team– two agents, one of whom stays in the lobby.
Yes, which is why we’ll need a ruse that prompts the Director to go see the good doctor tomorrow.
[ smiles ]
Are you all right?
Lizzy, you will make it through this. Everything happens tomorrow. Agent Ressler won’t let you out of his sight.
It will be. ⋘⋙ The routine is always the same. The unhappy couple arrive separately and are escorted into the lobby by two agents. One agent remains downstairs watching the entrance, the other escorts them onto an elevator to ensure they ride alone in their misery. Dr. Huffnagel is on the sixth floor, suite 612, catty-corner to the elevators.
The layout of every floor in the building is identical. All we need to do is recreate the sixth floor on the eighth.
Whoa, indeed. I need you to access the elevator system to make sure that when that agent presses 6, the elevator takes them to 8, where we’ll be waiting.
 Harold Cooper and Agent Navabi are working on that as we speak.
Apples. Get a bowl. Something glass, crystal.
He won’t.
I know what she said, Marvin. Why are you still here?♤ [ Gerard leaves ] Everybody likes apples.
Baz.
Give it a second.
Everybody likes apples.
Don’t worry.[ Distorted voice ] Lynda’s fine.
Peter! Welcome back. Boy, you were out! Like carrying a bag of boulders.
I envy anyone who can sleep soundly on a plane. Then again, I’ve never been injected with propofol. [ To Diaz: ] You have the Post Toasties?
Heavens, no. Nothing nearly so pedestrian. The fact is, you’re not my prisoner at all. You’re officially in the custody of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. You must know Mr. Diaz, Foreign Minister and National Security Advisor to the Venezuelan President.
Oh, your God can’t help you now, Peter. You’re traveling over the Atlantic, on the Venezuelan President’s Airbus, – on your way to The Hague.
I wouldn’t know. But you’re going to have the distinguished honor of becoming the first American official ever to be charged with even a single war crime, let alone the slew of them you will undoubtedly be accused of – before the week is out.
He needs an American in the flesh. The court will not try anyone in absentia. So far, no country has had the courage to deliver one of your countrymen to the court until now. You’re a trendsetter, Peter. Who knew?
Precisely what I’m counting on.
Good afternoon. Raymond Reddington calling for Laurel. Peter, please, do sit.
Laurel, Raymond here. Here’s where we stand. In a handful of hours, this jet will land in Rotterdam, it will be met by the Dutch federal police, who will escort the Director to ‘S-Gravenhage, where the global spectacle of a high-ranking American official charged with war crimes will begin. Ah! The sound of acquiescence.
What I’ve wanted since the beginning – for you to exonerate Elizabeth Keen.
 Fine. But after you hang up with me, your next call had better be to your President. Tell him you refused to prevent your country from being humiliated, implicated, and probably convicted. This is quite a can of worms, Laurel. If you have any doubts about that, turn on your television.
Quite the opposite. Now you may be concerned that exonerating Agent Keen will make you and your government look, well, foolish, but I’m handing you the solution. Yes, you got it wrong, but thank heavens you finally found the real culprit. Of course, my offer will get considerably less generous if anything should happen to Elizabeth Keen. You’ll call me back.
My attorney will explain everything.  His name is Marvin Gerard.
[ Exhales ] The same.
That doesn’t work, Laurel.
He was orchestrating a conspiracy to frame Agent Keen and implicate her colleagues.
Then this plane will land.
Pick up the phone, Marvin.
Marvin?
 Get it done. Hand the phone to Laurel.
Okay, Laurel, we have a deal. Onbce you’ve made a public announcement, I’ll drop the director somewhere safe.
I expected as much.
Not quite. There’s one more thing, and it’s not negotiable.
Lizzy. Have you seen the deal?
It’s not everything we wanted, but it’s close. You’ll be safe. You’ll be free.
 Yes. 
I wish I could deliver the perfect outcome, but I’m afraid –
Fairness is overrated. And maybe there’s a way to get you all the way back. But for now, Lizzy, for today, sign the deal.
 [ Chuckles ]
Hello, Peter.
I can’t think of even one set of circumstances in which that would be any of your business. [ Scoffs ]
We’ve been descending for some time now. Looks like we’ll be able to drop you off in time for dinner.
Sign the deal.
 I’ll drop the Director somewhere safe.
 Given the circumstances, I don’t believe that’s possible. About the ladies –
 What do you know about Shell Island?
 Please. The Shell Island retreat is the pet name for an assembly of affiliated criminal organizations.
 You look surprised.
 Your past three months have been what my life has been like for the past 25 years. I’m often exhausted. The Shell Island retreat is a ritual that dates back to the roaring ’20s. The de facto master of ceremonies is Marcus Caligiuri, next in line to Espen Van Der Merwe, but to assume leadership in the Pater Dei group, the world’s oldest and largest weapons dealer. The leaders of the Bratva, Yakuza, and assorted international cartels. They gather when they are presented with a problem so difficult, it can only be resolved by enemies working together.
 There is no Shell Island. It’s just a name. The actual location of the meeting is always a closely guarded secret.
 Howard Jasnoch. He’s a competitor of mine. He’s arranged transport for the individual who called the meeting.
 I don’t know. What I do know is if he’s called a meeting and the members are gathering, he’s a very big fish. Whatever is troubling him, whatever has caught the attention of these men is critical. No less than an existential threat. These meetings are infrequent, Lizzy, making this a very rare opportunity. Follow this fish, and you can net the entire school. 
 He’s a probe.
 I’m not interested in the data he has. I’m interested in the data he’s looking for, about me and my relationship with this task force.
 Yes, people are talking about whether I’m cooperating with the FBI. Rumors are swirling. And whoever he is, he was sent to determine whether those rumors are true.
 Hello there. Are you enjoying the accommodations?
 [ Laughs ] I must confess to feeling curiously flattered.
 I did.
 Because I can defeat a polygraph. So can he, or he wouldn’t have suggested it. If I were you, Harold, I’d concern myself with finding Janet Macnamara, who apparently knows all about our little arrangement here. You need to find Janet before she talks.
 I forgot how much it sickens me to come here.
 Because my life depends on it.
 Is it?
 Tom.
 [ Door whirring ] There’s something you need to see.
 The Cabal is in green. Their affiliates are in red. Their competition is in blue.
 Since I’ve been a fugitive, the pestilence on this map has only grown. This is what we’re up against – a multi-headed hydra. You cut off one head, it grows two others, you have to cut off every head and burn the rest of it. It’s a mythic battle, and it’s not anywhere close to being over.
 I wish that were true, Lizzy. But the manhunt revealed certain facts that had long been hidden about you.
 Katarina Rostova was a name that had been lost to history. Masha Rostova was never more than suspicion and rumor. The manhunt and the publicity it generated changed all of that.
 The daughter of a legendary spymaster, the secret-keeper who disappeared–
 The secrets she took with her could compromise any number of players on that map. They’ll be coming. They’ll be coming for you.
 They don’t know that. You can’t walk away, Lizzy. They won’t let you.
Harold is nothing if not predictable.
Thank you for your concern, Lizzy.
Borsheim.
Thank you.
Marcus. Hello, everyone. It’s good to see so many friends and even more enemies. Welcome to Shell Island.
Borsheim.
Comforting to see that everyone’s appetites for food, lies, and larceny have not diminished over the years. And although some of you might have room for yet another dessert or patience for one more hilarious story, I’m afraid I don’t. Earlier this week, the murder of three of my contractors was ordered by someone in this room to send a message that they believed I was working with the FBI. It was a vile, cowardly, unforgivable act, that quite frankly has resulted in very little impact on me when compared to the devastating loss felt by the children of those three dead women. Now, given the publicity surrounding the assistance I rendered to Special Agent Elizabeth Keen during her recent stint as a fugitive, I understand where one’s suspicion may come from, but it is unfounded. And before this dinner is over, I will not only prove that I have not betrayed us, I will identify the person who has.
I’m sorry, but “been dug”? Is that correct? That doesn’t sound correct, Marcus. – I think it’s “digged.”
I’m fairly sure “digged” is the archaic past tense. I suppose they’re both grammatically correct. Sounds funny either way. I’m sorry. You were saying?
And others. What’s your point, Marcus?
I thought we weren’t supposed to have phones.
No, I profited handsomely. I didn’t realize that was against the rules.
The only assistance I gave Agent Keen was after she shot the Attorney General.
She was a fugitive, Dmitri. I was paid a significant fee by certain unnamed parties to aid in her escape. It’s what I do.
Take your seat, Marcus. Your information is incorrect, and you’re standing in my light.
How fortuitous. We were just talking about you. You.
May I present to you Raymond Reddington? [ All murmuring ] Pour the man a glass of this wonderful port. It appears this party’s just getting started.
I told you that before this dinner was done, I would prove my innocence and identify the person who’d betrayed us. Meet the fake Red. Faux Red. Fred.
I took Agent Elizabeth Keen on as a client when she was a fugitive to gain her trust in exchange for information as to who was responsible for decimating our ranks. Like you, I’d heard the rumors that I was the one who betrayed us. And sure enough, after gaining her trust, she confirmed that the Bureau’s confidential informant was a Raymond Reddington.
 By the way, very clever, Marcus.Abducting Janet Macnamara in your search for the truth. But you and I both know the confession you coerced from that poor woman you’re holding at Calabrese Fine Imports was simply to confirm your lie.
You’ve been nipping at my heels ever since the incident at that awful karaoke bar in Mombasa.
It’s simple. Marcus hired him.
To surrender himself to the FBI, pretending to be me so he could use the feds to dismantle my business.
You want proof? The FBI would never fly blind into an operation like this. He’s wired.
You can go after a man’s business, Marcus, even his associates, but other than family, the only thing off-limits is a man’s reputation. You have given false allegations against my good name, which will be whispered and repeated by those who envy my success no matter how thoroughly I repudiate them.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I never wear cufflinks.
Actually, those belong to me.
[ To Red #2 ] But I suspect the FBI is on its way because of you.  So now we’re all in a bit of a hurry.
I need you to put to rest any question about who hired you. Now.
[ Whispers in his ear ] You were right, Marcus. I am the informant. Tell all our friends in Hell to be patient. I’ll be along soon enough.
Perhaps we should all get our hats and coats.
Oh, yes. About him. [ 💥 Gunshot. Red shoots Red #2 in stomach ]
We’re not going up, Dmitri. We’re taking the service elevator down to the garage.
[ Later, in car, with Macnamara ] [ Indistinct radio chatter ] I know you’ve been through a terrible ordeal, Janet, and I’m sorry for that. But unfortunately your knowledge of my relationship with the Bureau is inherently dangerous to you, your family, and to me. So please listen carefully and follow my instructions to the letter. First thing tomorrow, you will inform your superiors that the trauma of today’s experience was such that you have re-ordered your priorities and wish to spend more time with Bob, Tyler, and the dogs. You are going to move to Santa Monica, California. I’ve purchased a beach house. The deed is in that envelope. Your property taxes will be paid for on a biannual bases, and I’ll be checking on you from time to time to make sure you’re still … safe. Travel safely, Janet. The sunset over the Pacific is magnificent.
Gregory Devry.
Gregory was a dear friend and a brilliant grifter. He made a good living conning con men.
Gregory had terminal stomach cancer. So at his request, I euthanized him.
I have many contingency plans in place. This was one.
The FBI would never permit me to do the very thing necessary to make the plan work. Let everyone escape.
Are we working together? The way you were talking before, I wasn’t so sure.
Tom?
You will not marry her.
You married her over my objection once. It will not happen again.
Edward Weston was an associate of mine. His murder remains unsolved – the cause of his burns, a mystery until now. William Dowd, found under the 14th Street bridge this morning sprinkled with burning lead.
We boring you, Donald?
She’s recovering nicely.
I’m sure it is. You confiscated her firearm.
You should be recuperating.n
The Holy Vehm – a vigilante group that operated in the Germanic regions of Europe during the Middle Ages. The Vehmic Court was sanctioned by the Emperor and directed by the Archbishop to punish sinners.
 Well, in the 15th Century, the Vehm meted out justice for heresy and witchcraft. But today, who knows? During the height of their power, they killed thousands. If I’m correct and the Vehm has been resurrected, there’s no telling how many victims you’ll be looking at.
You should be resting.
That won’t be necessary.
Here. [ Places gun wrapped in dark cloth on desk ] Careful, it’s loaded.
Yes. I’ve known for some time.
Everything. Your body, your skin, a look in your eyes, different tastes for different foods, nausea, distracted, moody.
I assume Tom is the father.
I know you want to believe that our work is done, but it’s not. The addition of a child will make that infinitely more difficult. 
When I was young, I romanticized the life of an outlaw. Bad guys. That was a long time ago.
Yes.
You just won’t rest, will you?
Tell me about the other victims.
So your theory is that someone has reorganized a 15th-Century cult to hunt and kill pedophiles.
Not all of them. My associate, Mr. Weston, the man who started us down this road, was many things, but a pedophile was not one of them. I saw his dark side, and it did not involve children.
You’re right. Of course.
Thank you, Lizzy.
You attacked a pregnant woman, broke three of her ribs, battered her so badly she was left lying unconscious in a grocery-store parking lot.
[ To Dembe ] Call Mr. Kaplan from the car. We need to find Gerald Sullivan.
My, God. Gerald, burying your business in the dirt like a dog. How the mighty have fallen. What the hell is this? A terrible time of year to go camping, but I suppose we do what we must when we’re on the run. Brenda and I were just catching up. She’s not hungry, but I noticed you packed some bratwurst and couldn’t resist. I do love a good cookout.
I think you had Weston killed, and Locke, Bosker, Hundly. Someone is clearing the playing field, Gerald, and my money is on you.
I know how the market was divided. In fact, I was impressed by how well you co-existed with your competitor– until now. You got greedy, Gerald.
If you’re not controlling the Vehm, then who is?
I came here for one thing, but I’ve decided I’m gonna leave with two. The first is the name of the person who controls the Vehm.
[ Gleeful ] A song, Gerald. I so wanted to be a scout– tying knots, the Pinewood Derby, and the campfire songs. Oh, those songs. I keep trying to explain to Dembe, but I’m no singer. Just one song!
Ah!
Yes!
Right? [ Laughs ]
Okay, then. Just the name.
Stop me if you’ve heard this one. A priest, a eunuch, and a pedophile walk into a bar–
I’m here to offer you the sacrament of confession. I’ll be your Father Confessor. I know, the hypocrisy is staggering.
ou know what my problem with religion is? Man. Like anything that has a potential to be beautiful, man will turn it into something ugly. For every saint, there are two million sinners.
Like you, I’m a sinner– an envious one, I might add, as my transgressions are not nearly as divine as the ones you’ve been guilty of during the years you’ve been associated with the Vatican Bank.
Ah. [ Chuckles ] Generally speaking, I’m not a huge fan of the incorruptible, but your new pontiff? He is not your father’s holy father. He has an undeniable decency, which you sorely lack.♤ Yes. At his instruction, you helped to root out corruption so that the Vatican Bank would no longer be in the money-laundering business, but to paraphrase Aristotle, corruption abhors a vacuum. So you moved right in. You and your little band of eunuchs. Kudos on that, by the way. Gathering sick men, tricking them into thinking they’re killing pedophiles when, in fact, they’re killing money launderers whose business you covet?
[ Laughs ] No sin in murder or money laundering, so long as it serves our Father here on Earth or you.
Oh, that. I wasn’t really interested in hearing it. Although I suppose life in the abbey must be full of intrigue. What I am interested in is a proposition. Care to hear it?
I do. One that should appeal to you. It’s a money launderer– a formidable player who presents a significant obstacle to anyone interested in clearing the playing field.
Contact the Vehm. Tell them to meet us here. I’ll explain everything then. Not before.
Mm. The FBI raided their chamber of horrors– killed one, captured some others. They’ll talk. And when they do, they’ll talk about you. So, my proposition is this. Do what I’m asking, do it now, and I’ll make sure you go someplace quiet where the FBI will never find you. [ Chuckles ]
Ladies! What a pleasant surprise. Especially you, Agent Keen. I didn’t expect to see you in the field.
Yes. God, it’s god-awful. If they’d only switch to a good Burgundy, people would be much more devout.♤
Ugh! Meeting with congregants. Something about church finances.
Yes. I’ve done business with a few of the people they were tricked into killing. So it was easy enough to provide the details necessary to show them they’d been terribly misled.
I have no idea.
Probably. Hell hath no fury like a fundamentalist scorned.
The cardinal did it for me. He was quite excited about it, actually. In exchange for the promise to keep the FBI from finding him, he agreed to sic the Vehm on one last money launderer. I omitted the fact that the cleaner he was inviting the Vehm to kill was, in fact, himself.♤
Yes.♤ To raise capital in preparation for war.
Ours.♤
I missed you. [ Referring to hair style ]
Lizzy, I misspoke earlier about your child. I said that having it would be inconvenient.
[ Sighs ] When your mother was pregnant with you, it was terribly inconvenient. The Cold War was ending. Her country was falling apart. Everything she had ever known. She dreaded having a child. Almost aborted it. Not one day of her pregnancy did she ever think of you as anything but a curse. And then, from the second you were born there was never a day when she thought you were anything but a blessing. In my experience, there is never a convenient time to have a child. It certainly isn’t a convenient time for you. But if in saying that, I left you with the impression that I didn’t think you should have your baby, I’m sorry for that, because nothing could be further from the truth.
What I did was for your protection.
I’m not a threat to your safety, Lizzy, or your child’s. On the contrary, I can guarantee it, but I cannot do that if you run away.
I wish it were that simple.
Yeah. Oh, I should probably mention, I booked a pregnancy massage for you. She’ll be here at 9:00. Her name’s Edwina, she’s a registered nurse, and she smells absolutely divine. [ Referring to couch: ] I hope it goes with the rest of your stuff. I’m told it pulls out.
 I assume Tom is the father. I know you want to believe hat our work is done, but it’s not.
Plans change. Between Seoul, Moscow, then back to Beijing, then Shanghai, it would have been a month and a half. I canceled it. I wanted to bring you something.
What good is a collection if it doesn’t grow? [ Chuckles ]
It’s German– pre-war. Survived the Allied bombing in ’45. Miracle.
What is it?
Do you love him?
I see your new home is a work in progress.
What colors are you considering?
Have you ever heard of the promnestria?
It’s a term the Ancient Greeks used to describe a matchmaker– a negotiator.
Yes.
I let myself in because the situation is urgent. On Wall Street, a well-planned merger can return a windfall profit. Criminal enterprises are no different. The promnestria convinces sworn enemies that there is more profit in friendship. In return, he gets a percentage of the new  venture. He only surfaces when he sees an opportunity for enormous financial gain. And I’m afraid he has resurfaced to unite two very lethal enemies.
As I said, the matter is urgent.  
Remember the jazz club you took me to in that little cave in St. Germain? We should go there right now.
When did it close?
[ Chuckles ] Oh, my gosh. It’s been that long. [ Red notices Josephine has bruises on her wrist. Sighs ] I can protect you. All you need to do is ask.
Oh. Hello, Lizzy. You have the photo?
Your law enforcement agencies love their gadgets and their sweeps. The FBI admitted to spending, what, a billion dollars in facial-recognition software? Which means they spent at least $3 billion. Honestly, if I paid taxes, I’d be outraged.♤ Rogelio! Como esta?
This man, I want him found.
Right now hotel maids, cooks, waiters, valets all over the city are receiving that photo and will be searching for our target. The people who do all he cooking, cleaning, washing, carrying, and parking, hey have access to everything. You may recall I once had he opportunity to broker the sale of Rembrandt’s “Storm On The Sea Of Galilee.”
Well, the man who actually stole he painting– Rogelio’s cousin was his gardener. How is Tony?
Ohh. Dembe will give you the number of our man in Calexico. He just built a fabulous tunnel. We’ll have Tony back by this time next week.
Your fee and a bonus to the first person to spot our man.
[ On phone ] He wasn’t after the son. The fiancé was the target. He’s brokering a marriage.
The promnestria will require a meeting of all family members to formalize the arrangement. Find that meeting, and you’ll find him.
Funny you should ask, Harold.
Hello, Mads.
Your contact at the port of New Orleans– call him. Confirm he received an anonymous ip about a DEA raid. Saved you about $10 million in lost inventory.
Do you have any cookies? [ Line ringing ] Ah.
These are yummy. It’s the nutmeg, isn’t it? I’ll call you soon.
Wedding present.
I respect the decision, Mads. Difficult one, I’m sure, but good for business. Mazeltov!
What about you? Danny Vacarro for an in-law. Talk about a labor of love.
 Laughs ] 
Thank you, my dear.
I’m a sucker for mob weddings.
I didn’t know the two of you were on a first-name basis.
To our enemies.
[ To Dembe ] All things considered, mom’s a little cheery. Keep an eye on her and Danny while I find the happy couple.
May they have the patience to endure one more toast. I am but a humble guest, but please permit me to raise a glass to what I think we all can agree is the most improbable yet consequential occasion.
Love is a funny, fickle thing. A slippery slope. Most weddings are fraught with it. This one, not so much. This is business. The brainchild of a brilliant opportunist– a broker of bonds, a procurer of peace. You would think, being singularly responsible for this evening’s prenuptials, he might take a bow. Where is he? Come now, don’t be modest. You do such astonishing, despicable work.
I’m dying to hear how he did it. How he brought you two jackals together. How he got rid of Christopher’s fiancé, Anna. How he lied to the boy, let him believe she was slaughtered by the Vacarros, only to turn around and convince him to marry into the very family he despises. What a telenovela!
Oh, here we go. Better than TV.
[ To Dembe ] Grab the bride and groom. Meet us at the car.
Might I suggest we have this conversation on the move?
Oh, for God’s sake.
[ Laughs ] Mr. Pitt and I have a plane to catch.
’d be happy to drop you somewhere safe along the way.
Josephine.
Josephine! Where are you?
Josephine? Josephine? No. Josephine.
Josephine. Josephine. [ Breathing heavily ] Josephine, no, no.
I bought this flat four years ago. So that some day I could bring you here to the scene of your crime. Josephine Molire. Now, listen. Josephine’s father was the most prolific criminal arms dealer in Eastern Europe. But for all his success, he had a problem, an enemy. An aggressive and lethal competitor named Stockwell.
Yes, you did. Perhaps not directly, but very much by your hand. You arranged a marriage. The youngest Molire daughter to the only Stockwell son– a burgeoning psychopath with a long and troubling history of violence. To guarantee peace and profit for all, you arranged her marriage to this man.
I held her in my arms and watched the life disappear from her eyes. You destroyed a creature more beautiful than you could ever comprehend.
Josephine it’s done.
Hey.
A trust account for your child.
When I was young, I loved fairy tales. I was always partial to shapeshifters, who seemed good and sweet, but they were full of unimaginable darkness. 
Once upon a time, there lived a woman in the woods.
[ Laughs ] You know it.
Every culture has their version of a mythic creature who takes children. The Germans have Der Grossmann, the Mexicans– La Llorona. But there are whispers that Lady Ambrosia is not a myth, that there’s a real woman out there– takes unwanted children and raises them with the promise of eternal youth.
This little boy turned up out of nowhere yesterday, and I wonder if Lady Ambrosia played any part in his disappearance.
He wasn’t missing. He died four years ago. And he’s not the first.
I doubt it.
I think you have me mistaken for somebody else.
Thank you.
Like I said, I think you have me mistaken for somebody else.
45 minutes, Glen? 45 minutes.
Stacked up?
It’s February.
I do not wait for 45 minutes in that petri dish of humanity unless I absolutely have to. This is a matter of life and death, Glen.
If you find this woman, if you get it done fast, your tawdry liaisons at the no-tell motel will be a thing of the past, as I will personally introduce you to two young ladies you will never forget– soft, warm, blond, and willing.
Tell Trudy you have to cancel.
He’s here for your protection.
The money isn’t for you.
No, but your child does.
Why would you do that?
You think your life is too dangerous for a child. But what is your life without one? I can tell you from personal experience– not much. What?
He wants you to keep the baby?
We had a deal. Two ladies for you, one address for me.
I want the address.
I thought they’d be a nice gesture. I  thought you’d like them.
Or maybe you’re afraid they won’t like you. Dogs are very intuitive. They’ll know if you’re hiding something.
They’re homeless.
Ah, you know what? Forget it. Just forget it. I’ll take them back.
What about the dogs?
I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t important.
What you endured, most people never recover from. I doubt I would have. But you’ve turned it into a calling. Nikolai would be proud.
The Glasnost files– there’s something in them I need to see.
One of the bravest men I ever knew was deaf– Zeeb Pasha, a Communist I shared a cell with in a military prison outside Ankara. Zeeb and I were interrogated by the K Section– foot whipping, hung by our wrists, electric shock. [ Chuckles ] I was nothing more than a groaning heap in the corner. Every time our guard passed the cell, Zeeb would start signing. His fingers were a blur– pointing and tapping, twisting and swirling– the same thing over and over again and again. Lo and behold, one night, our cell was left unlocked. Turns out the guard’s daughter was deaf. And old Zeeb had been signing, “my wife, my daughter, my life.” Six words, unspoken, convinced that guard to let us go. [ Sighs ] Such a beautiful language. Like that girl just then– what did she say to you on her way out?
[ Pause ] The Glasnost files.
What if I could give you answers about your daughter? Would that change your mind?
Baz did, after he saved you.
Same as yours– missing children. Brimley is in there, speaking to the only man who can tell us where to find Lady Ambrosia.
When I said that Baz saved you, I wasn’t looking for a “Thank you”. I’m just relieved.
Your parents loved each other very much. The Cold War was hard– too hard for your father. When the Soviet Union was collapsing, he took you from her. She gave up everything to follow him, to follow you.
Your mother, despite what he’d done, she wanted him back. She wanted them to be a family. As much as it pains me to say it, he was probably… the only man she ever really loved.
It was an accident.
Your mother was never the same after that. The man she loved killed by the child she adored– it was… just too much. Two months later, she went to Cape May and left her clothes on the beach, walked into the ocean, and was never seen again.
You were a child. There should never have been a gun for you to grab.
Looking back, I’m not sure I shouldn’t have raised you myself. I don’t want you looking back with that kind of regret. 
I believe you abducted Anya Patinka. Where is she?
I don’t know what that means.
By abducting children?
What process? What process?
Where is she?
Anya Patinka– where is she?
Her fairy godmother. I hear it’s her birthday. We’ve come to celebrate.
It’s been some time since freshman English, but I seem to recall that fairy tales about abandonment, death, and witches are supposed to allow children to deal with their fears in symbolic terms, but there’s nothing symbolic about this place. You’re a real witch.
I believe they’re already on their way. While we’re waiting, how about I tell you a story? It’s about a mother, her two sons, and a canoeing accident.
The family lived by a river. The boys often took a canoe out to fish. One day, the canoe tipped. Inexplicably, the elder son, the golden child, the champion swimmer, drowned, while the younger, the lesser child, survived. The way Noah tells it, you allowed Theo to believe it was his fault, that he was the reason his brother died, that he would have been better off dead.
By “this,” you mean the horror of being different. Is that why you kill them?
From what?
Not even his mother?
From where I sit, there’s only one ugly person in the room, and it’s certainly not you, Theo.
Thank you. 
It just keeps getting worse. 
It just keeps getting worse.
Why would you do that?
He wants you to keep the baby?
I’m gonna take a shot in the dark and assume you mean Tom.
Why would you think that?
I am not your Tom problem, Lizzy. Tom is your Tom problem.♤ [ Thunder crashes ] I’m sure he’ll turn up soon enough.
Because Roberta Smith at the Times said it was worth a look. And it seemed like a fitting spot to introduce our next adventure. You’re looking at a crime-scene photo. It appeared online a few hours ago, along with a breaking-news bulletin about the murder of Randy Brenner at his new home in Richmond. The local police are flummoxed. It obviously wasn’t your typical home invasion or burglary gone wrong. It wasn’t a crime of passion. It is, in fact, to one somewhat disturbed individual, quite literally a work of art. Those who know of his existence call him Drexel. Considers himself a performance artist. And like most performance artists, his work is a form of social commentary.
Last winter, he murdered the owner of one of the largest CAFOs in Europe.
A Controlled Animal Feeding Operation. Hung the owner up on a hook like the cattle they butcher.
[ Laughs ] Drexel does not employ subtlety to get his point across. His work shows up in unexpected locations… sometimes only for a few hours.
Yes. A small-but-rabid following. Death as entertainment. Drexel makes them feel part of something– an underground protest movement.
Because he’s advertising it. 
Right. Which is why we’re here now. We’ve come for the fugu kimo.
Blowfish liver. Contains a poison 1,200 times deadlier than cyanide– so lethal, a single fish can kill 30 grown men.
Ah, Chef Hanzo. And yet I hear you prepare it so brilliantly.
My associate and I read about it. You were featured in an online publication called Rigby. A marvelous story. Relax, Hanzo-san. We’re not here to cause trouble. We just want a little information. I’m trying to get in touch with the woman who interviewed you.
Perhaps you can find us a phone number. 
Pops. You know, I always liked that name. Louis Armstrong was called “Pops.” Willie Stargell, the legendary Pittsburgh Pirate. My lord, that man could smack a fastball. There was Pops Foster, Pops Fernandez…
[ Laughing ] Oh, my. And then there are different pops entirely. Like the pops you hear when your shoulder’s being dislocated. I need you to hop on that radio of yours and let whoever’s in charge know that I’m outside. 
Indeed.
 I read Rimona’s piece on torafugu kimo. Chef Hanzo and I just became friends. He said I could reach her here.
It’s not her identity I’m interested in. It’s the subject of her next profile– Drexel.
What do you have in mind?
 Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First, I need to speak with Rimona. 
Not on the street. Let’s get in a car.
Lower your voice, Lizzy.
You made yourself clear this morning, Elizabeth. You can blame me if you like.
If he dies, it’s because he put himself in exactly the wrong place at exactly the wrong time. He did this, not me.♤ And that robbery the police want to ask him about– diamonds. He was part of a team that stole tens of millions of dollars’ worth of diamonds. A team I hear included his ex-girlfriend Gina Zanetakos. He’s reckless, dangerous. He’s not worthy of being your husband, and he sure as hell is not worthy of raising that child.♤
Ah, the fair Rimona.
I know you suggested to your editor that we meet later in the week, but I’m afraid our business couldn’t wait.
Your source is a serial killer.
As a reporter. Amazing times, these, don’t you think? When any Tom, Dick, or Sally with a laptop and internet access can declare herself a journalist.♤ I mean, you don’t even use a last name.
Oh, but I think you will, Rachel. That is your name, isn’t it? Rachel Hobbs. Daughter of Randall Hobbs, the patio-furniture king of Costa Mesa, California. I admire your respect for anonymity, Rachel, but your principles are a luxury I can no longer afford. So I’ll give you a choice– you can protect his anonymity or yours. 
Dembe. [ Motions she’s on the catwalk and to follow her ]
[ To Dembe ] Get her out of here. 
You know, I’ve often considered my love of art, and I realized it’s not just the art– it’s the artist. I like art a lot, but I love artists. I love the stories behind their work… The characters. Lopping off ears… Rankling the establishment with paintings of soup cans… Often boldly revealing themselves to our keen observation and insight, our scrutiny. What a marvelous thing, the courage to create.♤ Though I must say, nothing about your work strikes me as courageous. It seems self-indulgent, petulant. Like a tantrum from a child who’s just realized that the world can be a dark and unfair place.
And this latest manifesto? Beginning with the murder of Randy Brenner. What is it that you feel so compelled to say?
An enemy of mine contacted you.
A work was commissioned.
I need to know how to find your benefactor– now.
Mm. An address. You can answer me, or I can turn that wall behind you into a Jackson Pollock.♤ 
People say youth is wasted on the young. I disagree. I believe wisdom is wasted on the old.♤ All you can do is part with it, but very few will take it. Least of all, the people closest to you.♤ They want no part of it. No matter how often I warn you about Tom, you seem intent on discovering those perils for yourself.
I know… I say things that unsettle you about the dangers that lie ahead. I know I anger you with things I say about Tom. But if I’ve ever given you the impression that you won’t survive this, that you and your child aren’t going to have the simple life that I know you long for, I’m sorry. Because you are going to have that, Lizzy.♤
Where’s Rostova?
Nine days ago, a painting was commissioned. It was sent to this address, shipped to you– Mr. Paul Allond.
[ Scoffs ] You can send it back.
You will not marry her.
He’s reckless. He’s not worthy of being your husband, and he sure as hell is not worthy of raising that child.
How are you feeling?
[ Chuckles ] We?
Right.
Are you aware that a gentleman in your State Department has been murdered in Beijing
His name was Russell Pritchard. Murdered by the Chinese as payback for the assassination of a Chinese official, Zhang Lau.
With the help of Addison Wen, an extremely powerful Chinese-American businessman. While Zhang Lau was in town visiting the UN, Mr. Wen invited him to a dinner party at his home. That night, Zhang Lau is poisoned by agents that Mr. Wen agreed to let the State Department place on his serving staff. That agreement, it seems, was recorded by Addison Wen himself. He knew once the murder was committed, he’d be considered a loose end by your government.
Precisely. Which brings us to our next blacklister. They call him The Caretaker, a secret keeper– documents, recordings, photos. The caretaker maintains an impenetrable safe-deposit vault for criminals, governments, captains of industry, and he only releases those secrets according to one’s specific instructions.
I agree. And yet, my sources tell me Addison Wen is very much alive and was in no danger of prosecution, which means something has gone terribly wrong. The integrity of The Caretaker’s operation is the only thing preventing thousands of closely guarded secrets from being exposed, secrets that implicate powerful and dangerous people. 
If his system is failing, I assure you, Russell Pritchard’s death is only the beginning.
… I know someone who can.
He’s quite an eccentric, a recluse. But I’m a faithful client, and he’s agreed to meet with us. There is one thing that I can’t seem to… wrap my head around.
Tom. After all the lies, all the deception and humiliation, how you can just forgive and forget.
That’s a charming sentiment. But as far as I’m concerned, some things are unforgivable. Shall we?
He’s approximately 60 feet beneath our feet. ⋘⋙ He calls himself Hugo. He’s a hobbyist of sorts. Spent 20 years meticulously restoring and expanding the old BRT pneumatic tube system.
Oh, yes. Fully functional and wonderfully reliable. Hugo runs it as a private service to a specialized clientele. I’ve been a client since his early days, and I’m wagering The Caretaker is, as well. Oh. Try not to stare.
Hugo! I see you’re busy as ever.
Well, you know Dembe. And this is former FBI Agent Elizabeth Keen.
And in that capacity, she has alerted me to a troubling development… [ Bell rings ] …and may have grave repercussions for many of your clients and, well, you.
I need you to give me the location for one of those clients– The Caretaker.
Normally, I would agree. But The Caretaker’s system has been compromised, and the FBI are looking for him. They will find him. And then…
No doubt. But if you can give us his location, Ms. Keen will steer the Bureau away from you, guaranteeing you will not be imprisoned. Now, wouldn’t that be nice? 
Luftreiber Air? What secret of theirs is he keeping?
All very cut-and-dried. Unless the rumors were true.
Perhaps to shift blame from another institution, one with an even great responsibility for the safety of German citizens.
And they failed to alert the airline to the threat. Luftreiber claims responsibility, shielding the bureaucrats from a scandal in exchange for remuneration for the inevitable blizzard of lawsuits. One hand washes the other.
Have you got any leads on who abducted his daughter?
Forward me anything he finds. But under no circumstances can that contract become public knowledge.
Very well. Make every minute count. But if you fail, I warn you, do not expose the Germans. 
You’re certain?
Thank you, Darla.
Watch the road, Dembe. 
[ Sighs ] What you said about forgiveness changing the future– it comforts me to know you’re looking forward again. The future holds such promise. The past– so many regrets. The van is lined with Chobham ballistic armor. Virtually impregnable, heat resistant, most often deployed in tanks and APCs.
Semo!
Oh, sadly no. I gave it to a North Korean general in exchange for a young woman’s freedom.
As I recall, you’ve always carried a torch for oldsmobiles. I have a line on a low-mileage, pristine 1970 442 with a factory W-30 package. I can put you in touch in exchange for a small favor. You interested?
[ Laughs ]
What? Oh, my God. You released the Luftreiber contract, and now the Germans are refusing to cooperate.
And now many more may die. I don’t mean to gloat, but boy, did I tell you so.
Yes, but this isn’t about port security. It’s about cargo theft in Florida. Luckily for you, Harold, I poke my thumb in many pies. This one is particularly profitable, so I’ve associated myself with some of the players.
Their methods are breathtakingly simple– place their own tracking devices on cargo containers, track them out of the port, and attack them when they’re most vulnerable. Yes, they can help find your truck. The question is– why on earth they would want to.
They’re Mexicans.
Yes, you will.
I’m curious, Harold. How do you think the White House is going to express their appreciation to me for foiling the terrorist plot? Maybe an embossed ashtray. Or one of those little American flag pins for my lapel.
[ Chuckles ] I’m here to call in your chit.
Nobody uses the word “Chit” anymore, do they? Rhyming with a vulgarity didn’t do it any favors.
The Caretaker’s ledger. I’d like to borrow it.
Mine certainly is. If you insist on sleeping in the office, I might suggest you forego the floor and get yourself a futon. Your chiropractor will thank you.
Harold, forgive Charlene. A friend told me recently that forgiveness won’t change the past but could very well change the future. Apparently, nothing is unforgivable. Go home, Harold. 
Velov is the one who lied to you, Lizzy, not me. Katarina Rostova committed suicide in 1990.
But Velov knows differently.
That could easily have been planted.
[ To Dembe who is digging into a grave with a shovel ] This is above and beyond, my friend. Above and beyond.
If anything happened to me, this was to go to Elizabeth. 
So she would know. 
Now I’m not sure I ever want her to know.
Anything happened to me, this was to go to Elizabeth, just so she’d know.
72 hours ago, Matias Solomon escaped from custody while being transferred to a holding facility.
The official story is he overpowered a guard, wrestled away his gun, and managed to kill the entire transport team before vanishing like the proverbial will-of-the-wisp.
Apparently not, considering all of the dead men were assets of the Cabal. Yesterday, Solomon reached out to an associate of mine… a man with a very specialized field of expertise. Solomon was inquiring about the storage and transport of tactical nuclear weapons, which would be troubling enough on its own, but coupled with the fact that your Air Force is scheduled to transport just such a weapon down the New Jersey Turnpike, I’m afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, Lizzy.
This is about preventing Matias Solomon from getting his hands on a nuclear weapon.
I was hoping you’d say that.
I just got off the phone with Agent Navabi. She thoroughly briefed me on the situation.
No, Lizzy. I’m here to ask you, to implore you, please, don’t do this. I’m telling you, no matter what you believe, Tom is not the man you think he is.
He’s a criminal.
Men like Tom don’t change. You’re attempting to build a life with a man who is fundamentally dishonest.
You were wrong about him once. What makes you so sure you’re not wrong this time? Do you really want your child to pay the price for that mistake for the rest of his or her life?
Why didn’t she escape with the others?
The mercenary Agents Ressler and Navabi arrested at the motel. She could have fled with Solomon, escaped in the S.U.V. with the others. Agent Navabi said she broke off on her own, tried to get away in a second vehicle. Hand me the phone, Dembe. I need to see that vehicle. 
You’re sure?
Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe the car means nothing. Maybe she was just unlucky. Why didn’t it start?
She’s a sacrifice. Solomon isn’t after that weapon. It’s a distraction to keep us looking one way while they go another. He’s after Elizabeth.
There is no attack. There never was. The target is Agent Keen. You need to get to the church, Donald.
Ever since Elizabeth went public as Masha Rostova, still waters have been stirred up and old grudges have surfaced. And now someone out there is singularly focused on coming for her.
No. To abduct her.
In retrospect, that’s a perfect choice. He knows us intimately. He knows about the task force. They gave us a false trail, and we followed the scent. Donald, if I’m right and this was all an elaborate feint, all that matters is that you get to that church now.
Nobody gets in.
Elizabeth, I’m sorry, but we need to go.
Men are coming for you. We need to leave now. ⋘⋙ Solomon never intended to take that weapon. He was contracted by an employer to take you.
Aram, get these people out of here now.
I’m sorry, Lizzy.
We have a perimeter. Agent Ressler’s en route. In the meantime, we’ll have to hold the fort.
The others?
Yeah.
It’s curious. I thought you were the Cabal’s most loyal soldier. And yet here you are, under the patronage of a new benefactor.
So where do we go from here?
So, this is your big plan – an assault on a building filled with armed FBI agents? Honestly, Matias, I expect better from you.
Came together rather nicely. They went with ruby fringe tulips and pink peonies. You’d be impressed.
They’re jamming it. When Solomon calls back, they’ll have to stop. You’ll have a few seconds to get a message out.
Lizzy, your mother is dead.
I’ll tell you what I know as soon as I know you’re safe.
Lizzy, you are not going out there – under any circumstances.
No. [ Cellphone rings ] Hello, Matias.
There seems to be some disagreement on that score. We’ll need a little more time to sort this out.
Brace yourselves. They’re coming.
Yes. All of this, indeed, is on me.
They’ll attack the front first. Try and drive us out the back. Most of his men will be there.
Harold, we need to barricade that back door.
If we get out at all, it’ll be through the front. Most importantly, you need to keep Elizabeth out of sight.
Baz. Harold, some cover.
Dembe. The bag.
Elizabeth.
[ To Liz ] We will get you out of this.
Tom, get her out of here.
I’m afraid your wedding plans will have to wait, Lizzy.
Solomon was contracted by an employer to take you.
Brace yourselves. They’re coming.
Get her out of here. 
Are you okay?
Who’s honking?
Tell Tom to drive you to the Mill Shop on L Street. I’ll send you the address and meet you there. It’s owned by a friend– Yong-Sun Hopgood. He’ll provide safe haven. We need to get you off the street quickly before Solomon finds you.
Elizabeth. Here. Now. I’m right in front of the place. Where is she?
Is she hurt?
Can you put her on?
You need to leave. Mr. Kaplan will be there in five minutes to pick you up out back.
I can’t protect you in a hospital.
Let me rephrase that. I cannot safeguard you and the dozens of innocent patients and medical personnel who’ll be caught in the crossfire when Solomon and his storm troopers put together where you are. I know how desperately you want to protect your baby, Lizzy. So think.
Circumstances prevent me from sharing more information at this time, Harold. Whoever employed Solomon’s services, they know too much. They’re breathing down our necks even now, listening, watching. I can feel it.
I don’t know. I’m hoping your team finds something at the scene. We need to put down this threat quickly. I’ll be in touch when I can.
What’s possible?
[ Angrily ] Oh, for God’s sake, Dembe, spare me the mystical reassurance. Everything is not fine. Where the hell was the perimeter defense at that damn church? You should have deployed four teams, five teams. Look at her lying there in this barbaric situation with her child’s life at risk. Everything is not fine. She never should have been at that Godforsaken church.
[ Peeks inside ] Congratulations, Elizabeth. May I see her?
Keep an eye on things here. I’m gonna get some air.
I’m sorry, Dembe.
What’s happening?
You mean induce a medical coma.
Tell Mr. Kaplan whatever you need. We’ll have it here immediately.
I’ve done nothing for you, Lizzy.
It’s the children whom the world almost breaks who grow up to save it.
I wasn’t talking about her. I was talking about you, Elizabeth.
“Here.” What do you mean, “here”?
Can we get one here?
Then we’re going to the hospital. Tell the paramedics we’ll need the ambulance.
I’ll handle that. I want a full protective detail to stay on site. I’ll ride in the ambulance, stay with Liz.
[ To Tom: ] No, you stay here.
 And she’d insist you stay and protect her child. [ Gun cocks ] You’re a father now.
Morgan, I have something for you and Danny.
We have a medical emergency. We’re at 1438 West Randall, laying a course for Mary Margaret Hospital. We’ll be duck hunting.
What’s her status?
Keep her heart beating, Nik. Please, just keep her heart beating.
2 1/2 miles. An ECMO team is standing by to receive her.
Oh, my God.
[ Coming to back of ambulance ] The driver’s been hit.
No, you’re not.
Then do something else.
What’s happening? Why isn’t it working?
Come on, Lizzy. Please, don’t go. 
Please, don’t go.
I don’t want Elizabeth in the morgue. I want our people to handle this.
There’s nothing you could have done.
No. She never woke up.
You’ll learn fast.
[ Offering to take the baby ] Do you mind?
[ To the baby: ] That’s a good name.
That’s enough.
What a desperate thing to say.
Everyone dies someday. 
[ Mumbling ] No. No, no, not yet. I want another one. I want another one. I paid and I want another.
Mm.
Cape May. Cape May, New Jersey.
Don’t go, Lizzy. Please, don’t go.
Everyone dies someday.
Marvin, it’s Raymond. I’m taking a leave of indeterminate length. Suspend all transactions. Pay off all my outstanding debt. If you need additional funds to cover any shortfall, execute a wire transfer from Barbados. Dembe has a power of attorney letter on file should a signature be necessary.
[ To the cabbie ] How much for the cab?
No, no. How much do you want for the cab?
Hey! Hey! No! Stop!
I’ll find a blanket. 
[ BREATHES HEAVILY ] 
Hello? You okay?
Stay away from the window.
I found the intruder. He put up a fight. I had no choice but to kill him. [ He has a torn black kite ]
No. 
We’ll have hot water soon.
By the time we finish dinner, it should be hot. 
This is superb. The rice is just right.
It’s excellent. You aren’t hungry.
Who’s trying to kill you? Does it have something to do with what you told me before?
You said you lost someone. Harsh words were spoken. Words you regret.
You don’t have to lie.
I told you this is….
And those are?
[ Pause, then: ] It was a Hobson’s choice.* There was a woman and her child. Both were doomed. Both would die. I could either save one or lose both. I chose the child. It was… it was the worst thing I’ve ever had to do in my life. Worst thing by far.
There’s always a choice. I was arrogant. I presumed that there was an order to things, that there was… that if I nourished and protected and taught the child, she would be safe… …and happy.
No matter what I tried to do, all I brought her was misery and violence, and eventually…
Yes.
It’s that obvious?
I honestly don’t know.
Once, a long time ago. I was a very different person then. You?
What can I do for you, Officer… Duncan?
Oh, Yeah. I was afraid that might happen. That’s why the candles… didn’t want to alarm anyone.
Oh, good God, no. Jack and Ida are old family friends. Offered the place for the weekend.
No, no, no. No problem. I’ll be right back.
Of course. My mistake. Please, please. It’s a bit chilly out. Wait here. I’ll get my I.D.
I’m sorry you had to come all the way out here on such a cold night.
Yeah. My wife, Abigail. She’s feeling a little under the weather.
No. I can go upstairs and wake her, if you’d like.
Yes, I said I was  a friend. Poor Jack. Miss the hell out of that man.
Thank you, Officer.
I don’t think so. He’d have to be very good at hiding it.  We’ll see. Water should be hot. 
I didn’t say he was dead. I said I missed him.
State of the place. Hasn’t been maintained. A man wouldn’t let that happen if he was around.
“Jack’s Shack.” He took pride in that. Decorated it, carved his name on it. It’s falling apart. I figured he was either sick or dead.
I went with Jack. Men don’t usually last as long as women.
I am, in a way.
That’s an odd question.
Yes. Many. But never anyone who didn’t deserve it.
I know.
There aren’t a lot of us. You learn to recognize it.
Yeah. Thank you. You know him?
Why did you go into the water? What made you decide?
Yes.
That’s true.
There was a woman I loved. She was… my life. My heart. And she died. She left behind a little girl. One last, precious piece of herself. 
She’ll need protection.
I would give anything to be a part of that child’s life, but a man made it clear I would never see her… hold her… watch her grow. And I knew in that moment, I would never be any part of that beautiful little girl’s life. Because…
And to harm him would be to harm her. A mortal sin. Her mother is gone. The father is what she has left in the world.
Yes.
This’ll work. I’ll drive.
I’m not leaving without you.
No. I’m not.
You made it my problem the moment you walked into the ocean.
No.
Have you ever seen the aftermath of a suicide bombing…
I have. June 29, 2003. I was meeting two associates at the Marouche restaurant in Tel Aviv. As my car was pulling up, a 20-year-old Palestinian named Ghazi Safar entered the restaurant and detonated a vest wired with C4.
The shock wave knocked me flat, blew out my eardrums. I couldn’t hear. The smoke… It was like being underwater. I went inside. A nightmare. Blood. Parts of people. You could tell where Safar was standing when the vest blew. It was like a perfect circle of death. There was almost nothing left of the people closest to him. 17 dead, 46 injured. Blown to pieces. The closer they were to the bomber, the more horrific the effect.
That’s every suicide. Every single one. An act of terror perpetrated against everyone who’s ever known you… Everyone who’s ever loved you. The people closest to you… the ones who cherish you… are the ones who suffer the most pain, the most damage. Why would you do that?
Why would you do that to people who love you?
There’s always a choice.
What would you do?
I know.
I can’t.  
I don’t know your name.
We need to clean up and clear out.
There’s something wro… [ Red sees that the kitchen and other rooms are immaculate, untouched, as though he had just arrived. He goes to the staircase and shouts up: ]
Hello?
Where are you?
No. No, no, no. [ Red runs down the stairs, out of the inn and across the beach. He looks at the surf pouring in. This time, the woman is nowhere to be seen ]
Hey! Did you see a woman walk into the water?
You sure?
Just me.
“Canned mushrooms. Best I could do.”
“Behind you.”
Just me.
Could I, please? Please. I want to buy it. [ Brings out a thick wad of bills ]
It is to me.
To Katarina, love Papa.
I’m sorry.
There’s someone I need to see. [ Red turns and walks away from the shore ]
She left behind a little girl ⋘⋙ She’ll need protection.
I don’t know. Whoever employed Solomon’s services, they know too much. They’re breathing down our necks even now, listening, watching. We need to put down the threat quickly. 
Your granddaughter. She’s… I’m sorry.
Thank you.
As soon as the name “Masha Rostova” hit the 24-hour news cycle, they came for her. I thought I could… (SIGHS) protect her. I did protect her, all these years. I’ve anticipated almost every threat. (UTENSIL SCRAPING) But this one… …a medical complication in childbirth.
A girl. She was born prematurely, but she’s expected to be fine.
I came here to tell you that.
(PLAYING LOW NOTES on piano) I’d imagine it to be a challenge, playing Rachmaninoff’s C-sharp minor “Prelude” without the benefit of C-sharp.
I’m not entirely sure I know.
Excuse me?
God, no.
I just needed to be someplace… quiet.
I’m sorry for the intrusion. Let me give you some money, please. Could you pick up a single malt? Preferably from the Highlands, but not Islay. The water there tastes like seaweed and iodine.
I was just imagining young Katarina covered in glitter. As an adult, it’s easy to dismiss this stuff as girlish frivolity. You forget the wonder it creates, the light captured, secret wishes evoked. It renders even the darkest days sparkly. (BLOWS glitter into the AIR) Never underestimate the power of glitter.
Stop what?
That was never my intention.
I’m sorry, Dom. I understand.
I feel bereft, just like you.
Dom…
You still have family.
I couldn’t. You know how complicated it was.
She had your temper.
(INHALES SLOWLY, CLICKS TEETH)
Dembe…
What do you want, Aram?
Why?
Harold Cooper is a very capable leader. He’ll sort it out.
I’m sorry you came all the way out here for nothing, Aram. I can’t help you. (DOOR CREAKS)
To pay… m-my debt to you would require more than I possess. I’m not coming back.
(SWALLOWS) Ugh.
(EXHALES DEEPLY) How do you drink this stuff?
So buttermilk reminds you of home.
He’s from Delaware. You won’t be troubled again with unexpected visitors. I know how you value your privacy.
What would be the point? There’s nothing I could do that would really matter.
A way forward. I can’t live for long with what I feel inside. I don’t see how anyone can.
Dom, you’ve always had a good reason to walk out the door.
I’m here to pay my debt to you, Aram.
Strap on your bike helmet. We’re going to work. 
We’re going to work.
Elizabeth Keen is dead.
Boy, I can’t wait to hurt you someday.
Are you? A former Cabal operative led the assault that resulted in her death… Matias Solomon. You bungled his execution. He works for Halcyon now. I want him, and I want Scottie Hargrave.
Your government. Not mine. Give Halcyon a call, Laurel. Inform them that you have a job that requires their immediate attention.
[ Scoffs ] That’s nonsense. If Henry Kissinger taught us anything, it’s that the National Security Council has tremendous latitude in both advising the President and shielding him. You do many things he doesn’t want to know about. And I can tell you the President doesn’t want to know about what I have in store for Halcyon.
Elizabeth Keen was well hidden from the demons of her past until you went after her, until you told the world she was Masha Rostova. You put a target on her back and invited someone to take a shot. Do not try my patience, Laurel. On this topic, I have perilously little of it.
You’re here at my invitation. No, no, no. Please, Bradley, stay seated. This is an informal meeting. You know who I am?
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my, yes. Laurel’s as crooked as a dog’s hind leg.
Friends and loved ones are dead. I need to speak with Scottie about the matter. I sent her a message. She ignored it. She’s scared. Can be a terrible thing for all when someone as ruthless as Scottie gets scared. I need you to reach her for me, Bradley. I trust you would get through to her. I need her to pay attention to this.
Yes, I’m counting on that.
God, I’m starving. What time is it? 
You must be Samuel! What a pleasure. What a garden. I love daffodils.
They say gifting a bouquet of daffodils ensures happiness, while presenting just one means bad luck is on the horizon. [ Red gives Samuel a single daffodil ]
That sounds delicious, Cynthia. Tragically, there’s no time for snacks. Well, maybe some of Mom’s famous cucumber dip. [ Red has his pistol in his hand. He dips a carrot in the dip and eats it ]
Mmm. Mmm. You recently contracted Halcyon for a job on behalf of your company. I’d like to know the details.
Cynthia, is that a touch of Cayenne in there? What a nice little kick.
Tell me what?
A nanny movie?
Yes, I want to hear about it. All about it. Unfortunately, I do need to hear about your contract with Halcyon. So business first, and then, Cynthia, I’ll be all ears. 
Hello, Harold.
I had an enlightening meeting with Samuel Rand today. More to the point, with his wife, Cynthia.
He contracted them to help tame a savage competitor, Kerogent Holdings, who’s been flooding the market with cheap oil and driving down prices… to which I would normally give a hearty free-market thumbs-up, but the oil in question is being purchased from radical jihadists, the proceeds being used to fund all manner of nastiness.
(CHUCKLING) No. Given the recent glut on the market, oil companies around the globe are hemorrhaging. This is about profits. Halcyon will be attacking on multiple fronts. I’m only interested in one aspect of the operation. Kerogent is acquiring a large shipment of the offending petroleum at the Port of Amsterdam. Halcyon has plans to prevent the sale.
No, I want you to take the oil. The terrorists lose, we force Scottie Hargrave from the shadows, and turn a tidy profit in the process.
Harold, smile. We’re this close.
As long as we keep moving forward, I’ll endure. 
Scottie, you got my messages.
The death of Elizabeth Keen.
I want to discuss this in person.
That’s impossible. I’m on every apprehend list from here to Siberia. I cannot step foot in an international airport without being arrested. All that pesky security and facial-recognition software and whatnot.
 I’ll be there.
Yes, Tom?
Can’t say that I’m surprised. Disappointed, perhaps. Kill or capture?
Thank you, Tom. [ Hangs up ]
No. Let’s keep our appointment. Scottie hates to be kept waiting. 
(GRUNTS) [ Red drags unconscious Offiver Cousins out of sight of the stairs ] Whatever she’s paying you, I’ll triple it.
If you care so much for your partner, what are you gonna do when he wakes up? You just hit him on the head.
She’ll have me killed. You know that, right? You’re walking me to my execution.
I once spent part of a summer in Bermuda. The island. Certainly not the shorts. Not a lot to do there except ride motor scooters and play checkers with the locals. I’m more of a chess man myself. But one tactic that came naturally was the concept of forced capture… [ Red stops, enthusiastically gesticulating ] sacrificing a checker to force your enemy in one direction while your forces lie in wait for the exquisitely satisfying double jump.
One quick look at the airport schematics revealed why Scottie chose the lounge on Concourse F. Conveniently located near a little-used loading dock. Shall we?
I said “double jump.” You’re merely the first capture. Please, if you would. 
God, that door is slow. I was hoping for a somewhat more dramatic entrance, but what the hell. Scottie. Aren’t you the challenging woman to pin down.
Who hired you to go after Elizabeth Keen?
My fondness for your husband holds no currency here.
Who hired you?
I’d like to be sure.
More than likely the guard was in on the abduction, which Reddington walked right into despite knowing it was a trap.
You know, I used to have such high hopes for your organization. High hopes for Howard. Halcyon was once such a promising company… like AOL. Put an entire generation online. Companies can so easily lose their way. Forget what it was that made them great to begin with. I remember a time when your husband never would have taken a job from a man like Alexander Kirk, if only out of respect for his friends.
What bed have you been occupying?
You don’t say.
Survival is all relative. There are limits, even for people like us. Especially for people like us.
Here’s where we stand. Elizabeth Keen is dead, which means you are, too. Alexander Kirk is coming to kill you. The only surprise is that I got to you first.
You have it all wrong, dear. I didn’t come to kill you. I came here because you and I are about to climb into bed together, just for a quickie. We now share a mutual enemy. So, let’s get you bandaged up, not that you aren’t even lovelier with a little blood trickling down your arm. 
Scottie Hargrave.
Who hired you?
We now share a mutual enemy.
Tom, I want to speak with you about your daughter.
Even if you don’t want me to have contact with Elizabeth’s child…
I have virtually unlimited resources. I want you to know that those resources are at your disposal in the raising of Agnes.
Alexander Kirk.
The man who ordered the attack on your wedding. He’s ultimately responsible for Elizabeth’s death. I’m going to find him.
Was a contractor. A hired hand. Tom, until I end this, your only concern is to keep Agnes safe.
Absolutely not.
Yes.
Alexander Kirk is the alias of an oligarch who made a fortune after the fall of the Soviet Union buying mining operations for pennies on the dollar. In 2002, he went into hiding after falling out of favor with the Kremlin. He owes his survival to some of the world’s most powerful politicians whose careers he secretly bankrolls. But Alexander Kirk is the man responsible for Elizabeth’s death. He hired Susan Hargrave to abduct her, which is why we need to work with Hargrave to find him.
Until it’s not. The aid workers who were abducted in Jakarta? Your government refused to pay the ransom, turned its back on three young people who were captured for doing nothing more than providing medical services to the poor. Today, they’re home because Susan Hargrave committed what your government considers to be a crime in order to get them back. She’s a brilliant strategist. And if we want to get Alexander Kirk, we’re going to need her help to do it. 
Kirk’s holdings are out of reach. The Caymans, Zurich.
How much?
I’m impressed.
Him and everyone else.
You make it sound so fun.
I think you’re responsible for her death. I’m looking past that because I want Alexander Kirk’s head. And so does Tom Keen. I must admit I’ve never liked you, Scottie. Looking at you makes my toes curl. But robbing the next President of the United States? This is gonna be a gas. 
Senator! Having taken your money, I won’t take much of your time. Unlike Scottie, I have little use for politicians and even less for their politics. Who occupies the White House is of no interest to me. I tell you this so you know that taking your money has nothing to do with you or what you stand for. Truth be told, I haven’t the foggiest clue what you stand for, Senator.
Might be more prudent to call Alexander Kirk. I’m sure you have a contributor of his stature on speed dial. Call him.
I have your money. I have your senator.
Tomorrow morning, you’re gonna hold a press conference to announce you’re taking a moment away from the campaign trail to compel billionaire Alexander Kirk to testify about some of his business activities before the Congressional committee you chair.
 You are if you want to be President. 
Don’t do it.
Tom.
If you kill her, the answers you’ve been looking for your entire life will die with her.
Yes. Which is why I didn’t want you involved.
You have a child to raise, Tom. If you start asking questions, it will put her at risk, it will put you at risk.
Christopher Hargrave went missing when he was only 3 years old.
Susan Hargrave genuinely believes her son is dead.
Listen to me, Tom. Susan Hargrave has many secrets. Some of them concern you. If you want answers, you must conceal your true identity.
Alexander Kirk is the man responsible for Elizabeth’s death.
If we steal Diaz’s money, Kirk won’t be far behind.
I have your money. I have your senator.
You are if you want to be President.
A good man could make a real difference as President. A good man might even inspire one’s patriotic instincts, but a good man would never allow himself to be put under obligation to anyone willing to write a big check.♤ 
Don’t underestimate yourself, Robert. One way or another, I’m confident Kirk will come. I’ll have his head, and you’ll end up in the Oval Office, where you can pay off your debt to me with a full pardon.
Not me. Elizabeth Keen.
Yes. And I want things put right. 
Thank you, Kate. For everything.
It’s under control.
If you have the spare time, I would think you’d be spending it trying to learn about your parents. I understand Scottie Hargrave offered you a job.
You must have many questions.
In exchange for getting his campaign funds back, Senator Diaz agreed to pressure Alexander Kirk to come to America.
I thought taking Kirk’s money would be enough to smoke him out. It wasn’t. And as I understand it, he’s already sent word to the good Senator that he’s disinclined to testify before the committee and answer to what, as of now, are false charges.
Correct. But I felt it was just the kind of lie Diaz would enjoy telling, as it’ll inevitably score him political points… hit the sweet spot of jingoistic outrage.
Not yet.
No. I hijacked it because… I’m a criminal. I’m parting with it because Alexander Kirk needs to be killed, and if it takes planting a little evidence on him… so be it.
Yes. This one. I don’t expect you to dirty your hands planting the illicit oil. I simply need you to arrest Kirk’s employees once they possess it.
Have a little faith, Harold. 
Powerful sermon, especially for an old faker like yourself.
 And seven children. You’re like a rockstar without the income.
The Good Book.
What’s the difference between the pastrami Swiss cheese dog with sauerkraut and the Reuben dog? Aren’t those the same? Honestly, the amount of options overwhelms.
[ Taking his sweet time ] So it’ll be one Chicago double dog, hold the pickles, and one, uh… The, uh, Brooklyn Baconeer with cheese. Oh, and throw in some of those house-made sea-salt chips.
What do you recommend on the dessert front?
You know what? Toss in two of those little fried pies. You only live once, right?
These charges against Alexander Kirk for financing terrorism are ludicrous. And no one’s gonna touch him for what happened to Elizabeth. So I’m gonna kill him. He won’t live long enough to see the inside of that hearing room. I’m gonna kill him the instant he steps out of his vehicle. You and I both know… nothing less will protect Agnes and avenge Elizabeth’s death.
Harold, you and your people… …I will always be more grateful than I could ever express, but I don’t expect… or rather, I couldn’t accept your involvement in this final act.
I admire that about you, Harold. 
…It’s been a privilege… to see firsthand why the people you lead love you the way they do. But sadly, our time together has come to an end.
I do. (INHALES DEEPLY) We’ve done some good work. But with Elizabeth gone… there’s… nothing more for me to contribute. Please take care of yourself and the others. Charlene. Aram… set him up with someone, for God’s sake. He’s like a kid with his first erection on the school bus.
What’s the security?
Put Everly in the Veterans Building, looking west. Sandoval to the south.
They’re expanding the perimeter. Baz. Advanced teams will be all over the Veterans Building. Every window and roof within 200 yards will be scoped and cleared. We need to find another perch with a clear line of sight, and we need to find it now. 
Hey, gentlemen, put down your hammers. It’s time for recess. Simon says put your hands on your heads.
Don’t fret. We won’t be long. My associate will keep you company until our business is finished. ⋘⋙ This’ll work nicely. Everly, right there. [ Everly sets up shooting position for a tripod-mounted sniper rifle with multiple high-power scopes ]
Agent Ressler. Aren’t you the dog on a scent?
You spoke to Harold.
There’s nothing I care to take from Alexander Kirk except his life.
Oh, this is gonna happen, Donald. This is gonna happen in about 10 minutes. 
Yes, I know.
Elizabeth isn’t here, though. Is she, Donald?♤
I want to know where.
Donald.
It’s okay, Everly. Step away. Go find Baz. Give him a hand.
Yes, I believe that, Donald. But are you willing to die in the process?
You want justice for Elizabeth.
In my experience, they’re the same.
I know how difficult this must be for you, Donald.
You have faith. I envy that. Justice, integrity, faith in humanity… nobody embodies those principles more than you.♤
And I know it must be hard for you to believe that you’ll continue to embody those principles even after you watch me do this.♤
When Elizabeth was a fugitive, you played by the rules, did what you thought was right. But Elizabeth’s gone. Alexander Kirk took her away from us, and she’s not coming back.
What do you think’s going to happen if you stop me, Donald? That you’ll arrest Kirk? That justice will be done?
Do you want a bullet in Alexander Kirk’s head or one in mine? Decide now. What’s it going to be, Donald? ♤
It’s not Kirk. He’s not there. 
Aram, the manifest.
To where?
Aram, run another search. Every private flight to Abel Santamaria from the D.C. area in the last six hours.
Tom and Agnes. He slipped my security detail earlier today.
Well, he wouldn’t be traveling under the name Keen.♤
Kirk’s going after Agnes. Aram, the plane Tom was on. Who owns it? 
What’s going on, Omar? I’ve known you for over two decades. I was there when you renewed your vows with Eileen. And suddenly, you’re the person who takes Tom Keen and his child out of the country? Out of my sight?
Wrong answer.
Of all the people with a private air fleet, Keen just picks your name out of a hat?
Why in God’s name would you think that?
[ Incredulous and furious ] Kaplan.
I have nothing for you, Kate. No parables about loyalty, no florid speeches of trust belied, deception, treachery, or false devotion. I’m simply too bereft. It will have to suffice to say… I would name every human being on the planet before you if asked who might betray me.♤
I know what you’ve done. I know you helped Tom and Agnes leave the country without my knowledge.
Yes.
You’re wrong.
You don’t understand, Kate. I know where they are, and so does Alexander Kirk.
He was tracking Tom. He knows they’re in Cuba. He’s flying there as we speak.
I need an address. I know you had her best interests at heart, that you were trying to protect her, but now, because of you, Agnes is in grave danger.
How?
I saw her die.
[ Overhearing ] What’s possible?
I sat over her body… and watched her die.
Had it really come to that?
[ Menacingly ] Kate. What am I gonna do with you, Kate?♤
I need to speak with the patient.
As you well know, one of the keys to my success is a clear and consistent understanding of my own limitations. So often people overestimate themselves, misapply their gifts. The cleaner suddenly fancies herself the strategist. Wisdom is learning the boundaries of one’s designated lane. For instance, this, I will do poorly. Clumsily, with more mess than necessary. It’ll take longer and be considerably more unpleasant to boot. [ To Kate ] But I can’t very well have you do it, can I?
We’re looking for a name. Take a close look, Manny. He worked for a man who abducted someone I care about.
Who’s his rabbi?
There’s nothing more depressing than a failed Communist state. It doesn’t even really pay to be corrupt. When dirty cops play poker in America, they’re able to play for real money.
Let’s raise the stakes. A new game. You tell me who the head worked for, you keep the money, a 5-way split.
A young woman and her child were taken. A Russian has entered the country. I have it on good authority your friend here was assisting him.
Make that a 4-way split.
Well, isn’t this your lucky day? 
The head worked for a Joseph Balzan? I’ve never heard of him.
[ Ignoring her ] Dembe, call Silvio in San Cristobal. Tell him to put a team together. We’re going after Elizabeth. 
[ Threatens a worker with a gun ] [ Spanish ]  El Russo. Donde está? [ Where is he? ]
Elizabeth, are you okay?
Elizabeth? Elizabeth.
Constantin. What do you want? Name it. You bring her out unharmed, you’ll have it.
Whatever you desire.
No, – because she was never yours to raise.
Agnes. Do you have Agnes?
I’m not leaving here without you.
Elizabeth, I will come for you.
[ In car, on phone ] Harold, gather your team.
No, but she’s still on the island. Kirk’s preparing her exit plan. I don’t know what the preparations are, but I know who can find out– Manuel Esteban.
 Our next Blacklister.
Except he didn’t. Esteban is alive and well and a legendary enforcer for a series of authoritarian regimes.
Kirk’s man in Cuba is protected by the military. If the military is involved, Esteban will know about it.
[ Laughs ] Of course you do, Harold. Esteban. He works for your government. Castro took him in, and the CIA immediately put him on the payroll as a double agent. What little you know about the inner workings of the Cuban government is courtesy of Manuel Esteban. The CIA knows where to find him, and he knows where to find Elizabeth. 
My heavens, you’re a devil to get ahold of. I’m surprised we’ve never met. I’d like to have a little chitchat. How would you feel about a blind date? 
I’m looking for a woman.
Her name is Elizabeth Keen, and the man holding her has the protection of the FAR [ Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias. Cuban Armed Forces ]. They know where she is, which means you know where she is, or you could certainly find out.
[ Laughs ] Probably. Maybe more of an opportunist. And I have the opportunity to help you. You spent a lifetime bouncing from one authoritarian regime to the next. But this is the last stop. You’re a relic. The détente between America and Cuba makes you a man without a country. Sooner or later, both sides will want you dead. My money’s on sooner. I can take care of myself. [ Clicking ] Clicking like a hairless fruit bat is impressive, Manuel, but you and I both know avoiding a lamppost is very different from avoiding an assassin’s bullet. Echo location can’t help you with that, but I can.
I know what it’s like to be hunted. I’ve protected myself for 30 years. And I can protect you… after you locate Elizabeth Keen. 
[ To Kate ] Why don’t you wait in the car?
And the child?
Tell me about the location.
I’ll need more men.
For either of us. A stevedore will meet you on Pier 36. I’ve arranged for a berth on a container ship bound for Caracas. Adios.
Your job here is done, Donald.
You think I’m gonna let you tag along so you can inform the people who kidnapped Elizabeth they have the right to remain silent? I appreciate your assistance, but I’m not interested in having an ethical debate with you about whether they have the right to consult with an attorney before I put a bullet in their head. Excuse me.
It’s entirely up to you.
Yes, in order to save Elizabeth, I made a deal with the devil of the day. I did. You didn’t. If you have a problem with that, you’ve got 12 hours before his ship leaves to do something about it. Otherwise, safe travels home, Donald. 
Yeah.
It’s not a good time.
A small fishing port in Playa Larga. We’re on our way.
We’ll have Elizabeth shortly. And Agnes.
Thank you, Aram. Agnes is here. [ Car doors open ] Luis, you and your men take the perimeters to the north and the west. Dembe, secure the house. Silvio, you’re with me to the south. [ To Kate ] You stay put. 
They’re gone.
We have her. 
Tell him we were too late. Kirk has Elizabeth.
The child…
No.
No. Please assist Mr. Kaplan.
In danger. How did you find us?
Who was the driver?
You don’t know or you won’t say?
Little Nikos.
West Texas’ favorite bail bondsman. An Amarillo institution for 25 years to life. Dembe, call Edward. Tell him to ready the jet. We’re gonna pay a visit to Little Nikos. 
[ On phone ] We have two targets– Elizabeth Keen and Agnes Keen– traveling separate paths to an unknown location. Constantin Rostov, also know as Alexander Kirk, fled with Elizabeth in a private seaplane that departed from Playa Larga… mm, less than an hour ago, due west.
I have a lead on Agnes. She was abducted by one of Kirk’s private contractors, a high-priced tracker known only as Mato. He missed the flight off the island.
Ordinarily I would agree with you, Agent Navabi, but Mato isn’t your garden-variety mercenary. From what I’m told, he’s an Indian– part Sioux, part I don’t know what, son of a Shaman. Mato could sneak up on a deer in a glade and smack it on the rump. He’ll find his way off the island.
Of course you don’t. Regret requires age or wisdom.
I guess that didn’t work out. When we get to Amarillo, I think it would be best to do as I say, both of you. 
He and I don’t. I’ll be more persuasive.
You are not my concern. Agnes is. If someone you care about is hurt in the process of finding her, so be it.
You know I don’t know what you looked like. I was away.
You may speak to him first. Briefly.
Perhaps it’s time for a wake-up call.
Where?
And where might we find his stomach? 
Oh, my. Me and my timing.
Is this a lap band? I knew all those desserts would catch up with Little Nikos one day. I think I see some baklava in there.
I need your capable team here to wake up your patient.
Wake him up.
His life’s already in danger. [ Draws gun ] How ’bout yours?
[ To Kate ] Remember… we’re getting what we need, one way or another.
I’m not gonna hurt you, Nikos. You’re a good man. Loyal. Protective of those who are protective of you. I admire that in a person. Unfortunately for you, I’m surrounded by people who don’t. Tom, I’d like to introduce you to Little Nikos, the man who’s protecting the sociopath who stole your baby. Good luck with that surgery, Nick. 
I’m sorry it had to be Nikos.
What would you have me say, Kate?
Nakaidoklini?
[ Beckoning her: ] Kate. 
You’re doing fine, Maisy.
Tom!
Let’s get out of the heat. [ To Kaplan: ] Thank you.
This’ll be quick, as I have no time and less patience. Tell me where Alexander Kirk took Elizabeth Keen and her daughter. [ Silence ] The strong silent type. You’re not doing much to break down stereotypes here.
Mm. Or dying, I’m sure. You know, some years back, I was hiking Devils Tower for a bracing dip in the spiritual vortex, when who did I run into but the tribal leader of the Lakota Nation, a man of vast responsibility. He invited me to witness the extreme version of the Sun Dance ritual.
True, and you can’t get a table at The Fat Duck without a reservation. But I find in either case, a generous donation gets you in the teepee. I watched a tribal member, much like yourself, suspend himself from a cottonwood tree with flesh hooks through his chest. Three hours he dangled, skin stretched like salt water taffy, while he left his body to communicate with the Great Spirit. Like you, the man on that tree didn’t fear death. But you know what terrified him? The thought of eternity on earth, trapped in a dark box, surrounded by rotting flesh, forever. I hear that’s why some Native people leave spirit holes in their caskets, to allow their souls to pass on to the next great hunting ground in the sky.
After I shoot you, sir, you will be locked in an airtight, concrete crypt, unless you tell me what I need to know before those figures stop dancing.
Yes. I know the Summer Palace.
I know where Elizabeth is, Harold, where Kirk is taking Agnes. Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Kirk owns a cottage there where he would go to escape the dreary summers in Novosibirsk.
I don’t know and I can’t find out. I’m deep in the heart of Amarillo, Texas. How quickly can your people get there?
I’ll send you a location.
You always do, Kate. 
[ Turns away ] [ To Dembe ] Let’s go.
[ To Dembe ] Stay with the car.
There are places back here that have never borne a human footprint. 53,000 acres of virgin wilderness, all but one owned by the Bureau of Land Management. One acre, a jewel. A single buildable acre. Like a flawless diamond set in a sea of emeralds. The real estate equivalent of a unicorn. I acquired it some years ago from a family who had held it in trust for over a century and a half.
Yes. [ He stops ] You understand, Kate, that I–
You presumed to decide what was best for me. Even if I resolve the anger, the pain you caused… I can’t trust you. Ever. I’m standing before a stranger. And yet, I know you believe what you did was best for Elizabeth, which is why I brought you here. You’ve told me you’ve always wanted a pristine, unspoiled place to live out your days in peace. So the acre is yours. For all eternity.
I wonder what poor soul Mr. Kaplan buried down there.
I understand why you ran. You believe your family’s in danger because of who I am. But what you don’t seem to grasp is you’re also in danger because of who you are.
I’m doing everything in my power to find Agnes and bring her home safely to you.
Yes.
I’ll be handling it on my own.
He’s a venture capitalist of sorts, for criminals. What those in the tech industry might call an “incubator.”
What did you do, Harold?
And now three families will have to bury their loved ones.
I was very clear with Elizabeth you were not to get involved.
Who knows? He checked out of the Sovereign Grand after those detectives were killed. Thanks to you, Harold, he’s on high alert, and we just lost my best lead on Kirk and Agnes.
Who’s the photo of?
I gather Aram couldn’t identify the person in the photo.
Dembe.
Not entirely unusual. He was a SEAL.
Were there any witnesses left alive?
Four frog men.
Interesting.
I know an ex-SEAL commander, recruited some former colleagues, formed an elite heist crew. I hired them once to get back a shamefully expensive Patek Philippe [ $$$ watch ] I foolishly left on the nightstand in Ras Al Khaimah [ in the UAE ] after a dalliance with a lovely but very… Oh, never mind.
[ To Brimley ] Where are we at? 
Johan. Truth be told, I traded it for a bowl of pongal and a slightly used Ruger [ pistol ] after a particularly rough night in Bengaluru [ in India, aka Bangalore ]. But I will forever be grateful to you for retrieving it. Listen, pal, I have a job.
No, it can’t. I’ll double whatever you’re being paid. Come on, Johan. Burn the deal, help out an old friend.
Sounds like Martin and Lewis.
“3 Ring Circus,” “The Stooge,” “Sailor Beware”? Martin and Lewis.
Partnerships. They can be very rough. Mmm. Ah! [ Swallows the spirits ] [ Chuckles ] You know, BJ Simpson and I started a lawn-mowing business in the summer of ’72– bagging, hedging, the whole ball of wax. One day, I’m out rototilling Pat Hunt’s garden. I go in for a bottle of pop– must have been 110– and there’s BJ in the sunken living room, shoes off, feet up on the couch, eating a fried-bologna sandwich, watching Mike Douglas. Mike Douglas! Can you imagine? I quit that day.
[ Coughs ] Point is, I haven’t had a partner since.
[ Seriously ] Oh. Johan, you should walk away. I’d help you out if I could, offer a man, but… this sounds like a mess, a real mess. I am so sorry. Anyway, I’ve taken too much of your time already. Call me when you get things sorted out.
Depends on my cut. 
Don’t bite the hand that feeds you. He’s here for your protection.
We’re making progress. I told you Miles McGrath is an incubator, that he’s our link to Alexander Kirk. Turns out, he’s been incubating a crime with a man named Johan Halbeck.
That’s you. Halbeck’s running a mission tomorrow. He needs a man with your… expertise.
Desperate times. Staying close to Halbeck will lead to McGrath, and as a bonus, the FBI can stop whatever crime they’re planning.
Study date?
Mm. Anything interesting?
[ To Tom ] Halbeck will have questions. If he senses you’re not who you say you are, he’ll dispose of you.
Johan, where the hell was that guy going? The guy with the case. Please do not tell me that you parted with the best samples.
I’m your partner now, Johan, and I’ve been out promising prospective buyers the full complement of Class A weaponry. Do you have any idea what was in that sample?
Well, I insist on speaking with this so-called partner. At least let me try to buy it back. Halbeck: [ Chuckles ] Be my guest. Miles McGrath. His man went to meet him at the Lodge. It’s a bar. Find him, talk to him. Hell, I hope you shoot the bastard. [ Laughs ]
Gentlemen, mind if I join you?
Raymond Reddington.
Haven’t heard that last one. Never read the Le Carré novel. Dembe, we should see if we can get the audiobook on cassette for the car. Now, about that sample…
You were saying? 
Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. McGrath.
You’re a good strategist, Miles. But your odds are longer than you think. The FBI found that missing train, along with Halbeck and his team and the CDC samples. In fact, I’d imagine they’d be on their way here by now.
Not an ideal time, Harold.
Yes. As I said, I’m working on my own for the moment.
Wonderful. I have to go.
Well done, Constantin.
How’d you know I’d be here? Even I didn’t know a half-hour ago.
I have what you want. And I know why you want it. So it’s true, then. After all these years, everything you feared has happened.
It doesn’t have to be. You can have your virus. All I want is Agnes in return.
Yeah.
Kirk is dying. And the Ribowski virus is a temporary antidote to what afflicts him.
Yes. It’s a simple math problem, really. Kirk’s disease prevents his body from producing enough blood cells. The Ribowski virus results in a rare form of leukemia which creates the opposite problem– too many blood cells.
Eventually. But by offsetting his blood disease, he buys himself a few more precious years.
But he is that desperate, Elizabeth. Because he no longer has you. You wanted to know why he went so far to find you, why there seemed to be nothing he wouldn’t do to physically get hold of you. Now you know. He needs a biological descendant to save his life– a genetic donation from the woman he believes to be his long-lost daughter. That’s what you are to him– a collection of cells. This isn’t about saving you from me. This is about saving you for him.
Some years ago, I had a rather awkward encounter with a bull shark while diving off the Great Barrier Reef. I actually think it was trying to be affectionate, even a little forward. (LAUGHS) But the net result was excruciating. But I did spend a glorious month submitting to the healing hands of an utterly divine lighthouse keeper on Bramble Cay… a low-lying island that’s rapidly being submerged by rise in the sea levels due to climate change.
Our next blacklister is devoted to protecting the Earth from the greatest threat to its existence as we know it… us. He’s a stealth eco-terrorist known only as Gaia… Earth Mother in Greek mythology.
What is not relevant. Only where. We must find this man… unless you have a better lead on Kirk. Has he reached out to you?
Gaia then.
Nine times out of 10, the public reacts to an act of eco-terror by getting angry at the terrorist rather than the environmental offense he seeks to draw attention to. By disguising his sabotage in accidents, Gaia succeeds in focusing the public’s rage on the actual danger, not the criminal who exposes it. Shall I go on? 
Forgive the intrusion, keglers.
I have a job for you, Glen.
It’s a matter of some urgency.
We need to know who made this I.D.
Some haste would be appreciated. A child’s life is in the balance.
All I need is an address, Glen.
Glen, an address.
What the hell is he saying?
What?
He’s already given you the address, hasn’t he?
Dembe, call Elizabeth. 
What do you see?
We’re going to get her back, Lizzy.
Stone Park is on the Hudson. 
I need you to find her.
I need you to find this woman and her child, if there is one.
I don’t understand bowling.
[ Sits down ] I’m sorry, Glen. I’m sorry.
Hello, Maya. You’re a difficult woman to find.
And you must be Skyler. My name is Raymond. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you, Skyler.
No. But from what I understand, your ex-husband poses no further threat. You have nothing to fear and no reason to run anymore.
(LAUGHING) Oh, my goodness, no. I’m simply an interested third party who needs your assistance.
Forgive me. I took the liberty. In my experience, caramel sauce is an excellent lubricant when it comes to awkward introductions. Skyler, any chance I could convince you to go thirds with us on these?
His hematologist, yes.
Picasso said it took four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child. They live in a delightful space somewhere between dreams and reality. They taste color, hear shapes, see sounds.
[ To Maya ] There is a child. Her life hangs in the balance. I believe Skyler’s doctor could save her. 
You asked me how this case is connected to finding Agnes. Owen Ayers and his son Skyler share a rare blood disorder. But Dr. Sebastian Reifler is one with a particularly relevant distinction. He treats both Skyler Ayers and Alexander Kirk. If we can get to his doctor, we can get to Kirk. We’re getting close, Lizzy. 
How incredibly cruel.
She’s gone.
Forgive the Shanghai summons, Dr. Reifler, but I have a matter of some urgency we must discuss.
Is doing fine. It’s another patient of yours I’m interested in.
Oh, yes, you can. And you will… by allowing me to accompany you on your next house call to… Alexander Kirk.
As Alexander Kirk’s hematologist, I assume you oversee his transfusions and coordinate with his specialist. I want to know how it works– where you meet, with whom, and when.
Perhaps another go with the candiru fish. I understand they burrow into the most impossible nooks and crannies.
When did you last see him?
Then you’ll be seeing him within the next 24 hours. Where?
Never met the man. I am, however, a benefactor for the artists they hired to lead the restoration. As luck would have it, sprucing up the old apse hole will take months.
I usually have a devil of a time getting to sleep, but here I sleep like a babe in the manger.
Yes, and he’s going to lead me to Kirk.
The Lindquist Concern–
I’m not. The doctor gets us Kirk. The Lindquist Concern gets Kirk to give us Agnes.
A group that corporations pay to suppress inventions that would undercut them if brought to market.
Well, when they can’t kill the invention, they have the Lindquist Concern kill the inventor. Like Omar Najjar. He was working on revolutionary technology with the potential to save millions of lives. Now that it’s in the hands of the Lindquist Concern, it will save none.
[ Dialing ] Agent Navabi. I have your next case. 
What?
You did nothing.
Mind your bedside manners.
Dembe, please inform Edward we’re going to Geneva. Elizabeth, I need all the satellite intel the task force can get their hands on for this address, as well as schematics for the building.
What a curious concern for a mama grizzly going after her cub. 
He shouldn’t. And he’s not.
No. It’s only difficult if you accept the premise that Kirk is your father. I don’t.
Salvation… that will never come. 
During World War II, the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants smuggled Jewish children out of France to Switzerland. This was one of their staging areas. Now it’s mine.
My plan is to make contact with you as soon as Alexander Kirk is in my possession.
Given your conflicted feelings for Kirk, I believe that would be unwise.
Which I appreciate, but as you said, you’re in the middle. Given our mission, that’s not a point of view we can indulge.
My point exactly. 
Kirk’s medical suite is being set up off the Rue Baulacre. He’ll have a man stationed on the perimeter here…
..here…
…and at least two covering the south entrance here
I want everyone to memorize the layout of the interior. I don’t want any missteps.
I’m sorry, Dr. Reifler, but you’re not part of the planning committee. 
As requested, Doctor, your medical team, safe and sound. Bravo.
In five. 
How did he know? How did Kirk know?
Attend to my men.
Yeah.
No. Men are dead, others gravely injured… because someone warned Kirk.
I know that.
We’re at cross purposes, Elizabeth. Not about Agnes. About Agnes, we’re in lock step. But about Kirk– about who he is and what he wants– we’re… at odds.
Your call saved my life. Thank you.
Yes.
Mm. Good afternoon, Laurel.
Per our agreement, no friends and family discount. Our compatriots on the Cabal pay full market value. My cut is 50%. That sounds greedy. 45%.
May I pour you a glass of this delicious Aglianico? 
What’s this?
Hello, Oscar. I trust you secured the package.
Yes. And direct a generous contribution in Le Bron’s name to the Belarusian Refugee Fund.
Don’t be absurd. Oh, and, Oscar, that plane is mine. 
Iranian mullahs, Mexican cartels, radical despots… Your government declares them enemies and freezes their assets to influence their behavior. Economic sanctions are relatively easy to implement and historically effective. Until now. Agent Navabi, would you be so kind? [ Mouse clicking ] René Le Bron… Financier of terrorist states and criminal organizations. When your government freezes their assets, Le Bron offers them sizable loans, rendering the sanctions toothless and affording the bad actors the ability to continue conducting business as usual. When the sanctions are lifted, Le Bron makes a hefty profit by pocketing the frozen assets he insisted his borrowers put up as collateral.
Yes, Donald. Truth be told, I’m disappointed I didn’t think of it.
Good point.
Alexander Kirk is a client of Le Bron’s. After your government froze Kirk’s assets, he turned to Le Bron for a loan.
I intercepted Le Bron in Minsk closing a deal. He’s willing to cooperate, but on a condition I am powerless to fulfill… Immunity from prosecution.
Well, one can hardly expect unconditional virtue from creatures like René Le Bron.
Yes?
Thank you, Harold.
[ To Dembe ] Le Bron is dead. Right on schedule. Time to send out the invitations. 
Welcome to the past. This space is impregnable to every frequency of wireless transmission, including microwaves. Every piece of equipment you see is analog. Our sole concession to the digital revolution is a Ms. Pac-Man machine in the break room.
Because I like Ms. Pac-Man.
I know it. René Le Bron’s death was proof.
We set the bait. He took it.
I prefer the term “tethered goat.” Besides, Harold, the man was a degenerate, and his death denies pariah states access to ready cash, putting teeth back in the sanctions your country imposes with such tumescence.
Which tells us exactly who the culprits are… The Thrushes, a crew that hacks the unhackable. Created in 1982 by a charismatic Bulgarian genius… [ To Samar, stepping behind her ] Excuse me, sweetheart… Plemen Radkov. He was arrested in 1986 by the KGB and died seven months later in a Siberian gulag.
The Thrushes choose their clientele based on two criteria… Cash and the technical challenge of the hack.
Chester.
In both cases, powerful interests stood to gain. And now Alexander Kirk. Full access to all voice and digital transmissions generated by the very people dedicated to taking him down.
No, Harold, this presents a unique opportunity to feed Kirk disinformation.
I think camera two a smidge to the left.
[ To Liz: ] Hello.
He’s still not…
[ To Liz: ] Chester’s made some significant upgrades to your security. He’s an absolute marvel.
Any word from Kirk?
Honestly, Elizabeth, it astounds me that you could be hornswoggled by something as simple to fabricate as a DNA profile.
Just because he was your mother’s husband doesn’t make him your father.
I have never lied to you.
Kirk. 
Romania. No doubt untraceable.
You were very convincing.
When I turned myself in, I never imagined things could’ve turned out this… badly.
[ Scoffs ] I knew it’d be hard, but I… never expected that it would get… harder with every day.
He was never on it. He never would’ve been if he hadn’t come after her first.
I knew it would complicate things. I’d be forced to take security measures… Things she’d hate. Now all I see is the resentment in her eyes. I’m suffocating her, Harold. 
Are you suggesting we call it off?
I don’t believe Elizabeth’s concern is about her security or her daughter’s.
I’ll be handling Kirk on my own, Harold.
I do. If you expect this relationship to continue.
Maintenance tunnels here, here, and here give us access to the rendezvous point. Elizabeth left 10 minutes before us. We need to breach in five. [ Guns cocking ] 
[ To Romina: ] Down.
This is madness, Constantin. Because you cannot have that child, you’re gonna take her forever from her mother? It’s madness. Constantin, this needs to end now.
[ To his men: ] Stand down. Stand down!
I just wanted to thank you for trusting me, trusting the plan. I understand what a… 
… a leap of faith it must have been.
May I? [ Asking permission to enter ]
She’s a beautiful girl. 
I know. 
Good night, Elizabeth, Tom. 
Have you ever been spearfishing? You should go spearfishing. I love spearfishing. On the Ambergris Caye, there is a reef–
I have a Blacklister for you. They call him The Coroner.
Lionfish.
An aggressive, invasive species threatens the local habitat, leaves destruction in its wake. Sound like anyone we know?
Hmm. I took aim and released. In the water, it sounded like a dull thud, but the spear passed clear through. I’d already bagged six of them with glancing blows, tail shots. So I knew this last predator was mine. And the destruction it had caused was over. And then… it wriggled free.
But he will, Lizzy, with the help of someone on the inside.
You.
I think you’re compassionate. You believe he’s your father. When push comes to shove, your impulse will be to save him.
You must be The Coroner.
[ Laughs ] Samar, darling, please. Save it for Mossad summer theater. I used her to lure you here. She doesn’t need an identity. I do.
And you’re on the wrong side of 80, sitting on a donut pillow. My sympathies to your significant other. And if your flag is flying at half mast, rest assured, I find in the privacy of one’s boudoir, pleasing others is the key to pleasing oneself.
I’ve been disappearing for over 25 years. I don’t need your help to disappear. I need an identity, specifically the one you created for Sonia Bloom– the research scientist. 15 years ago, she arrived in her lab to find her life’s work stolen and her partner dead of an apparent suicide. Except it wasn’t a suicide, and she knew it. Fearing for her life, she contacted you and became someone else. I need to know who.
Hmm. Few things in life are truly impossible. Talking an Irishman out of vengeance for his brother’s death is one of them. You see that ruddy-faced fellow in my booth? Willie Adair. Back home they call him “Barking Mad Willie.” He has this pack of absolutely voracious wolf hounds.
But you gave the man who killed his brother a new identity. Perhaps I should call him over so you can explain your policy on confidentiality.
Hmm. Sonia Bloom.
Cheers.
Apparently, Adrian Shaw.
No, I didn’t.
I don’t know what the two of you are so indignant about. I told you about a criminal you had no idea existed, and now he’s in your custody. The Coroner gives you dozens of criminals you thought were dead or missing. Take the win, Donald. You could use one.
Found the teacup. Oh! And the banana. Mm. That’s 11. One more. Don’t tell me.
Mm.
One second. The sailboat.
Oh! Why’d you– Oh! [ Inhales sharply ] Show-off. 
Thank you. Dr Rayburn, thank you for seeing me without an appointment.
I have a pain right here. [ Reaches back to his hip, pulls out his gun out, cocks it ]
If I want narcotics, Doctor, I’ll call the guy with the briefcase like everybody else. I’m looking for Dr. Adrian Shaw. 
Dr. Shaw! Or should I call you, Dr. Bloom? Either way, I’ll skip the pleasantries. We haven’t much time.
I’m here with your colleague, Dr. Rayburn, who can confirm we have a situation. As we speak, the FBI is raiding his medical clinic.
I’m like the Ghost of Christmas Past… and Future, which is how I know the FBI will board your ship the moment it docks.
Belief is such a relative concept. Is there a God? Are we alone in the universe? What the hell have they found out there in Area 51 anyway? I prefer to think of your decision as judicious risk assessment. I have considerable resources to put at your disposal. I’m here to help you, Dr. Shaw. If you don’t want to go to jail, listen to me carefully. Firstly, is there a helipad on your ship? 
Yes?
I sincerely doubt that.
I kept her from you. There’s a difference.
You looked absolutely ravishing the other night.
What do you do to stay in such incredible shape? Calisthenics? Or Jazzercise?
Maybe we should be workout partners.
I’ll see you in dance class, Samar.
Dr. Shaw, fresh off the boat, as it were. Dr. Rayburn, I’m sure someone is sick somewhere who could use your assistance.
Goodbye. Please.
And you’re in my debt, which can be a complicated place to be. Shall we?
This was a thriving business that manufactured counterfeit cigarette tax stamps until a little over two weeks ago. There’s a hefty profit in tax stamps, and they’re a lovely way to launder money– a story I can share another time. Right now I have a pressing matter which requires your assistance.
You have no idea. 
Yes?
What are you talking about?
Get out of the hospital.
The only subject that interests me, Elizabeth, is your safety– a safety that has been guaranteed thus far because Alexander Kirk believed you to be his daughter. He now knows you’re not.
I’ll tell you what he won’t do. He won’t die alone in that hospital. I promise you, the plan is already in motion. All of Kirk’s resources will be brought to bear.
Every angle has been calculated. Every obstacle considered and accounted for. Men are coming, Elizabeth– men who kill every living thing that gets in their way. Tell Harold, and then you get out of that hospital.
And you’re in my debt.
[ On phone ] The plan is already in motion. Men are coming, Elizabeth. Men who kill every living thing who gets in their way. Tell Harold and then you get out of that hospital. 
You’re still at the hospital. I told you, you need to get out now.
You’ve told me you’ve always wanted a… pristine, unspoiled place to live out your days in peace. So the acre is yours – for all eternity. [ Gunshot 💥 ]
Did Elizabeth get out?
Well, she’ll be safe with him until Kirk’s doctors confirm she’s not his daughter, but we don’t have much time. We need to find patient zero. How long, Dr. Shaw?
My agenda has no bearing on your task. You know what you’re looking for. I need it now.
I’m out of time, Doctor, which means you’re out of time. Find the patient.
Tell me everything.
No. The FBI needs to find her. We need to focus on keeping Elizabeth alive once they do.
I’ll call you on this number when I know more. [ Cellphone closes ]
Call Baz. Tell him to get Dr. Reifler here right away. Go on.
Patient zero. I need a name.
A distinction I’m comfortable drawing. But human experimentation in the hull of a ship is a bit too Draconian even for me.
Her name. 
Dr. Reifler, I don’t know about you, but I’m experiencing the strongest sense of déjà vu.
Goons. That… that’s not fair. Well, Carlton is a bit goonish, but Matthew is actually quite erudite and a world-class chess player to boot. In any case, there’s someone I’d like to introduce you to. Dr. Adrian Shaw, meet Dr. Sebastian Reifler. Dr. Reifler is a hematologist. Dr. Shaw is a research scientist who worked with a patient you also treated, Lucille Bockes.
I won’t pretend to understand how it all works, but I must say, Dr. Shaw really is something of a wizard.
Lucille Bockes is alive and well… [ Cellphone rings ] and working as a prosecuting attorney.
Constantin.
No, she’s not.
She’s nothing to you. A distant, confused memory. I’m the one you want.
Then do that. An even trade.
You set the terms. However you want, I’ll do it. My life for hers.
There’s no more time.
It’s Elizabeth. 
It’s too late for her to save Elizabeth.
[ To Dembe ] Forgive me. For Kate. For everything. 
The ripe apple falls. Doesn’t know what else to do. So here I am. Time to let her go.
Constantin, I can save your life.
I have a cure.
202-555-0198.
If you wanna live, call the number.
There’s a science. Some sort of genetics. It’s called CRISPR.
CRISPR is not just experimental.
There was a breakthrough 19 years ago by a scientist who was murdered. His partner carried on his work on humans, not animals, with remarkable success. I have a doctor who can apply that science today. I can make her available to you.
Because I want you to save mine. Call the number.
You saw what Katarina wanted you to see. She lied to you about everything. KGB trained her to seduce… foreign diplomats, intel… intelligence personnel… into… believ… revealing secrets. You always thought I was the interloper. The truth is that I was an assignment. I’m… I’m sure you were, too.
A cover then. You were wealthy and powerful. [ Breathes sharply ] Gave her access.
It’s not a trick. It’s a proof of concept. NYT
It can save you.
We both die… or we both live. It’s up to you.
No.
No, I’m not gonna answer your question.
It doesn’t matter. She lived at… at your house as your daughter… on and off for… four years. Sometimes you were there, sometimes you weren’t. What difference does it make?
Sam Milhoan raised her after that.
It doesn’t matter.
[ Murmurs indistinctly ] What do you want me to say? Yes… [ Murmurs indistinctly ] Is that what you want me to say? Yes, Elizabeth is my daughter.
My proposition still stands.
Dr. Shaw is standing by in a fully assembled lab waiting for you.
You’re not gonna kill me.
Dying isn’t so bad. I did it once in Marrakesh.
Perhaps I should listen more. Tell me about Katarina.
Because we both miss her. Because… after all these years… I have forgotten what she was… really like.
Remind me.
… Dancing.
… A joy for living.
You don’t have to do this.
Yes.
Gone.
Gone.
It’s over. May I?
You had every reason to.
He would’ve wanted that, too.
You’re upset.
Harold, my objective was to keep Elizabeth and her child safe. I’ve done that. We’ve done that. Alexander Kirk is gone, and he won’t be back. It’s time to move on. Last night, a seafood processing plant in Maryland was attacked by armed commandos. Local authorities suspect rogue employees were secretly using the facility to package and distribute narcotics.
Now that you mention it, I do. Seven supposed employees were killed in the attack. Photos were circulated to law enforcement trying to connect them to the drug trade.
You’re not looking at a seafood processing plant employee, nor a drug dealer. That is Hassan Arkani.
You see? No time to dwell on the past. If my people hear anything, I’ll contact Agent Keen.
I did not forget that, or the plea agreement I worked out with Laurel Hitchin that kept her out of jail after she shot your Attorney General.
Good talk, Harold.
Wendy, dear, your ears must be burning. Dembe and I were just talking about you.
How are the boys?
Almost enough to make a woman hope Larry gets early parole.
To what do I owe the pleasure, my love?
You got something?
How many?
Their papers will be flawless. Who’s running it? Al-Hambri?
Thank you, my love. You’re like a human divining rod. You always know just where to look and just what to look for. Oh, and for what it’s worth, I dropped a little extra something in the mail this month. Thought it might help with the orthodontist bills.
Mmm.
[ Laughs ]
You really should try Ginny’s Cheeseburger Chowder. The ground chuck and spices, the melted cheese. I highly recommend it for the inaugural balls.
Marlin, your boss made a campaign promise to me, and I intend to make sure he keeps it.
Tell Robert I’ll be in touch. 
Oh, boy. [ Clears throat ] Isn’t this a sticky wicket?
As I mentioned, Senator Diaz made a campaign promise that I intend to hold him to.
I’ve been known to make the occasional charitable contribution. In exchange, my back is scratched by the good men in blue. Yours, not so much. You blew a .12. I
Which is what makes your relapse that much more tragic. The President can’t have a dipsomaniac serving as legal counsel. Happily, there is a way to avoid the drunk tank.
I have no idea. Let’s hope you’re smarter than everyone says you are, Marlin. Marlin– that’s not a very common name. I knew a Marlin when I was young. Marlin Trout. One boy, two fish names. Funny. Set the meeting, Marlin.
Slow down.
Have you identified anyone other than Farook?
Who?
He also isn’t Yusuf Tillisi. His real name is Ezra Mandell, an operative for the Mossad. Samar knows him. She’s worked with him.
To protect her fellow countrymen. To prevent you from linking the Mossad to the attack on Arkani’s operation.
At least we know why the NMB took her. The question is where and how long they’ll keep her alive. 
There you are. Dance lessons. What fun!
Just hoping the jackals and mongers will give you the time and space you need to settle in before they start feasting at your doorstep.
Robert, I know your dance card is full, but we have an appointment that I must insist you keep. The mustache is an interesting choice, sort of a Grover Cleveland look, I suppose.
Not quite.
And in exchange, you received a generous donation and an appreciable bump in the polls, and now look what’s happened. Robert, the man you’re replacing as the leader of the free world has a legacy he’ll want you to help burnish by keeping certain people and policies in place. He’ll want favors. To get them, this is one of the things he’ll have to do for you.
Then perhaps I should speak to Miriam. I’m sure she’s dying to know what kind of business you and I have been conducting. It’s up to you, Robert. Would you prefer to be in the White House or the doghouse?
I’d have to stick to champagnes and white Burgundies. One spill of a red varietal and this heavenly sanctuary would look like a crime scene.
But would I be capable? Let’s say somebody stops by with a Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, and it’s a ’78! [ Laughs ]
I just had a revelation. I could drink it in the kitchen! [ Laughs ]
Thank you, Pamela.
As my grandmother used to say, it’s good to have friends in low places. When Dembe said you had a case, I thought, how quaint. It’s not.
Yes. Judge Culpepper was above reproach, which means many people would like her dead, but none I could connect to you in any way.
Any leads off the diorama?
I’ll have a team outside your apartment within the hour.
Do not take this lightly. This is your next Blacklister.
He’s killed a federal judge, which means he goes after high profile targets. He left clues at your doorstep, which means it’s a game to him, one he’ll keep playing until you stop him. You’re being baited, Elizabeth, taunted by a killer who knows where you live.
Geoffroy! Thank you for coming.
[ Chuckles ] Tell me about cobalt.
I’m told Iniko’s investing in cobalt mines. I want in.
Do you recognize this apartment?
Belonged to a dear friend of mine, a former acquaintance of Iniko’s. I say “former” because Iniko had him killed right where you’re standing. Imagine all that blood on this very carpet. Amazing. It’s like it never happened, as if he never existed.
I’m interested in the mines, but not in doing business with Iniko.
Yes, I’m prepared to make a substantial contribution to the venture.
If he were still alive.
I’m suggesting that this is your moment if you’re smart enough to seize it. Iniko’s loyal only to himself. He suffers you because your uncle has the ear of the President. You’re a patronage hire who buys Iniko good will with the powers that be. But when they go, and they will, you’ll go. Like my dear friend who bled all over this white carpet. 
Iniko. I understand you’re in town to bribe a congressman. Tell me, what’s the going rate to get someone to ignore rape, slave labor, child soldiers, child brides?
The cobalt mines. I want in.
So lecture then. You’ve been betrayed by a trusted employee. I recently experienced a similar betrayal. So I know that it’s a bitter pill, especially since in our line of work, betrayal requires swift and decisive retribution.
Twenty-five percent. Assuming you can verify what I tell you is true.
Geoffroy Keino. He approached me about investing in the mines if I agreed to kill you. His terms were very generous, so you can imagine how tempted I was. But as I mentioned, I have recently felt the sting of duplicity. And I simply couldn’t bring myself to facilitate such a betrayal of someone else, even someone so loathsome.
No, thank you. I find it difficult to enjoy foie gras. All those poor geese, all those painfully engorged livers.
We’ll be in touch with any further developments.
Not here.
You sound surprised. [ Door closes ] And you look scared.
Perhaps he has a new acolyte. Or grew wary of your ambition.
Others might have. People hoping to gain his trust by betraying you.
[ Laughs ] But you’re here. So you want to.
Oh, please. Spare me the wide-eyed innocence. You’re the top aide to a man who pays your salary with the lives of women and children. You’re every bit as responsible for committing atrocities as he is. Cheer up, Geoffroy. This isn’t the end. It’s the beginning. Your beginning. One you need to announce loudly enough to scare off other pretenders to the throne. Might I suggest something in broad daylight? Perhaps a nice car bombing. A cliché, I know, but clichés work. That’s how they get to be clichés. 
Okay, calm down and tell me what happened.
And you think I told him?
Except the munitions expert who made the bomb, the mechanic who installed it. You were sloppy, and you’re looking for someone to blame. Blame yourself.
Then don’t go home. Iniko may not be taking your calls, but he will certainly take mine.
There’s always another deal. I have one in mind that I know he will find especially hard to resist. Relax. Have a drink. Help me finish this infuriating puzzle. And when Iniko does come, you’ll be waiting with a magic bullet. 
Unfinished business, I’m afraid.
I once bankrolled a diamond mine outside Tshikapa. One day, a man showed up alone, unarmed, started to talk to me about the mine. I had guns and guards and an enterprise worth… I don’t know, $50, $150 million dollars. He had nothing but a story about greed driving atrocities and conflict, about armed groups using mass rape and mutilation as a means to control people in the villages around the mines.
[ Continues ] I abandoned the mine, agreed to finance his campaign of protection and protest, and did so until two months ago when you had him murdered.
Yeah.
And somehow, your cleaners removed even the memory of his blood from this carpet.
They better be. They’re gonna have a lot to clean up. 
A piece of the mines.
On the backs of children. Given enough money to eat, but not enough to ever leave. Cyrus would be disappointed.
And instead of helping those who suffer as you once did, you profit off them. I’m a bad man, Iniko, but not that bad.
Ah, your cleaners. What are their names?
I want to hire them.
Not anymore.
Kate is irreplaceable.
Iniko just met his maker.
I did done… do.
It should. You cleaned it two months ago. Friend of mine, shot six times, 5 liters of his blood on this carpet. After you were done, not a drop.
Yes. And this is my associate Dembe Zuma.
I’d like you to work for me. Whatever Iniko was paying you, I’ll double it.
A day job. How old-fashioned.
Well, won’t this be fun. 
[ From across the room ] Incredible. Truly incredible.
Not a speck to be found.
Clean as a whistle. Clean as a whistle.
Well, this seems like a good fit.
[ Laughs ] So you do use club soda. Fascinating.
I spoke with Harold. He tells me you’ve had a… pyrrhic victory.
Chris Farnsworth.
For years, colleagues have crowed about his rates of return, urging me to invest with them. Called him “The Forecaster.” But as I don’t believe in investing in anything I can’t control, I declined.
May I see your new apartment?
Zack! We’ve spent the last 40 minutes being regaled with stories of Abe’s latest visit to Phoenix. Fascinating as it is to hear about the new culinary options at Sky Harbor Airport, I don’t come here to talk to Abe. No offense, Abe.
While you’re redistributing, an investment opportunity has come up. I need funds in that amount.
Oh, God no. Although, one could never have enough of those beautiful animals. There is, however, a floundering cruise line in urgent need of a bailout.
Elizabeth! I’d like to introduce you to one of my accountants, Zack Smoll.
Someone over-caffeinated this morning.
Your government’s Witness Protection list has been stolen.
No, but I know who’s going to steal it next. A stolen luxury vehicle in Atlanta being pursued by the private security contractors hired to protect it.
This was a jewel heist that netted over $10 million in diamonds perpetrated by a heist crew known as The Harem.
Well, this Harem is an elite group of female thieves who steal only from other criminals. And with the Witness Protection list out in the open, the timing is no coincidence.
Which makes the list extraordinarily valuable. And irresistible to the Harem. Catch them in the act of stealing it, and you’ll save the lives of everyone on that list.
You can’t. And if you can’t beat them, as the saying goes… 
I’ll be blunt, Mr. Wilson. Whistler Cruise Line is sinking. The band is on deck and warming up “Nearer My God to Thee.”
Running aground on endangered coral reefs, E. coli at the buffet, sailing half-empty ships. Your difficulties are about to land you in bankruptcy court.
Have you ever been to Mont Saint Michel? Tidal island in Normandy. The only way in or out used to be a causeway that disappeared at high tide. To reach the other side was a matter of knowing when the tide came in and seizing the opportunity before it arrived.
I’m offering you a causeway, Carter. I bail you out, you transport my cargo.
Could be Dutch tulip bulbs to New York, ghost guns from Danao. But instead of hypotheticals, allow me to assure you that plausible deniability’s the best option. I save your business, you don’t look too closely at mine. 
The guy your government was protecting was murdered by Tony Giannusa.
Because you don’t know if he has it or where to procure it. If you arrest him, you’ll never find out. Only Agent Keen can ascertain that.
You have protocols in place for when she does make contact.
She will. But only after she’s won their trust. Keep me informed, Harold. I want to know when Elizabeth checks in.
Smoll?
Try again. I want to know the minute the transfer is complete.
I placed Emma Knightly in The Harem so she could keep me posted as to their criminal activities.
Something like that.
Because Emma went silent.
Yes. By MI-6.
You can’t think the FBI is the only law enforcement agency I have a relationship with. Elizabeth, none of this changes the fact that the WITSEC list is still in play.
Emma Knightly can be trusted. I wouldn’t have put you in otherwise.
We’ll know soon enough. Carter! I’d stand, but after all these years, I still get aroused when I close a deal.
What are you talking about?
Ah. Something’s come up, and my accountant’s unreachable. It’ll soon be remedied. You’ll have your money before close of business.
With whom, may I ask?
Mr. Wilson, good day. And happy sailing.
I don’t believe in coincidences. 
Hello, Emma.
He looks just like you.
I can’t let you sell the list. I can’t let you fund a life on the run by exposing innocent people on that list.
There’s a cabin in Vermont on Lake Champlain. Remote. Simple. Once you’re settled, you’ll open a bank account. Money will be transferred into it to cover expenses, Will’s education.
If you wanted out, Emma, you should’ve come to me.
I’m sorry.
The list.
Yes. The list. [ He gives Liz the device with the list ]
Elizabeth…
[ Inhales ] Years ago, a Wisconsin housewife named Maureen Rowan was outside in the wee hours with the family dog, Dodger. It was absolutely frigid. No one in their right mind would’ve been out in that kind of bitter cold, and if not for Dodger’s aging bladder, I imagine Maureen would have been fast asleep. But as fate would have it, her neighbor, Alexei Lagunov… [ Sighs ] …the avtoritet of a Russian bratva, felt given the late hour and windchill, he and his boyeviks could move a body from his basement to the trunk of an associate’s car without being observed. They didn’t count on Dodger’s call to nature. So Maureen had a choice between remaining silent or doing the right thing. She chose to testify. And while she helped to bring Alexei Lagunov to justice, she also forfeited the rest of her life in doing so. She’s on that list.
Maureen Rowan is Kate’s sister– uh, Mr. Kaplan’s sister. I didn’t need to find her. I just needed to… make sure no one else can.
No. No, it doesn’t.
I understand. 
Where is he?
How much did he take?
And the money? Where’s the money?
Thank you, Abe.
Smoll didn’t have a heart attack. Someone killed him. Someone determined to start a war.
How much? Smoll was cleaning over two hundred million. How much was lost?
Thank you, Abe.
Yes. [ Clears throat ] Transactions vital to my interests failed to be tendered.
It seems that a bid I made on the Whistler Cruise Line wasn’t tendered because my accountant dropped dead before he could transfer the funds. In addition, millions are missing that the same accountant was in the process of laundering.
It appears my operation is under seige.
Not at all. However, in order for me to be useful to your task force, I have to maintain a certain stature in the criminal underworld. From time to time, I am compelled to rely on your Bureau’s support in that endeavor. This is one of those times. The interest I hoped to acquire from Whistler Cruise Lines was sold to a long-standing rival, Baldur Magnusson. Rumors have circulated that he assassinated my accountant to secure the deal.
Some help to determine who murdered my man Jack Smoll. If I can’t staunch the bleeding Smoll’s death has precipitated, all of our work could come to a grinding and permanent halt. I’m under attack, Elizabeth, and I need to find out by whom.
Are the rumors true that you’re responsible for the death of my accountant, Zack Smoll?
And you for me.
Because we’ve known each other for a long time. We understand each other’s organizations, if Cristobal acted without your authority or someone forced your hand, tell me. We can try and sort it out. After all, you’re a bit long in the tooth for a street brawl.
I’ve reviewed the case file you sent.
You know, many ancient cultures shares a common figure, a god or demon who brought disease to humanity. The Finns called her Loviatar, the Yoruba people knew her as Shapona. The Greeks of course immortalized Pandora. Odd that they’re always women. Have you ever heard of Mary Mallon?
She was a cook for the New York elite in the late 19th Century. When an alarming number of high society swells came down with typhoid fever, a research scientist traced the outbreak to a woman with the rare ability to carry the disease without suffering its effects or exhibiting any outward symptoms. Earning her the name–
Correct. You’re looking for an asymptomatic carrier of Luschen’s Disease. To find your suspect, you need to know when and where was the outbreak that she survived. And, hurry. There’s a reason the plague-bringers were the most feared among the ancient deities.
Please excuse the intrusion.
I’m not here to see Elizabeth.
What do you know about Edgar Legate?
Precisely. Because he doesn’t exist. Legate is an elaborate fiction, a bogeyman I created.
Or so you believe. Edgar Legate is nothing more than a name I employ to take credit for various killings for which I or my associates are responsible. One of my competitors, Baldur Magnusson, is actively seeking a reliable independent contractor to kill me, someone I won’t see coming. I think Legate would fit the bill nicely.
I thought maybe.
I don’t need you to become Legate to kill Magnusson. I need you to become Legate so Magnusson will hire you to kill me.
Yes. If you can find a sitter. [ Red smiles merrily at Agnes ]
Myron, my sincere condolences.
You did. I need Baldur Magnusson to believe Edgar Legate is in town. And what better way to announce that than by making him believe Legate killed a larcenist of your stature. And what better place for the deadly deed to occur than the flagship hotel Magnusson owns and operates.
[ Continues ] By the time our little charade is finished, Magnusson will be scouring the town desperate to hire your killer. Not to worry, Myron, we’ll have you out of there in a jiffy.
[ Continues ] You’ll be ordering room service and watching the game with my associates before you know it. You’ll provide the body, we’ll provide the evidence.
As a matter of fact, you can. [ Red shows the Concierge a photo of Tom ] I believe this man checked out of your hotel earlier today. He’s an old friend, and I completely lost my head and forgot our appointment. I was wondering if you could tell me where he was headed. The airport, perhaps? Train station? Or was he driving himself?
Keep it. Discretion is a rare and tragically undervalued quality.
[ On the phone ] Xavier Holcombe’s annual poker bash. An all cash, no limit marathon with positively obscene stakes.
Buy-in is half a million, quite the research grant for our starcrossed outlaws. I bought in on a lark three years ago. Lost my– well, no one has a shirt that expensive. Nevertheless, I had a ball. It’s a weekend of delicious isolation and degenerate risk heaven.
Belgium.
Tom is very good at what he does. It defines him. He can no sooner choose to stop than a great white shark can choose to stop swimming and eating. He will do what he does. But at least if he’s doing it for me, he won’t risk a double-cross, unlike with the vast majority of his prospective employers. Because unlike them, I genuinely care for him. Or rather you, and your daughter. Holcombe’s game commences precisely at 6:00. You don’t have much time.
In a manner of speaking.
[ Dismissing the others ] Give us a moment.
I would’ve done exactly the same. Keep the ships, Baldur. As Rat said to Mole, “There is nothing, absolutely nothing half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.”
It’s funny. For the longest time, I’ve been perfectly comfortable knowing I could die at any moment. I could walk out of this room and be shot in the street. I’ve always been fine with that. But lately, I can smell it in the air around me. Like death is slouching towards me from the corners of the room. And I cannot tell if it is here for me. Just an echo of the past. I wish it had been you. Would’ve been so much easier.
I’m sorry to have put you in such a difficult position, Harold.
[ Exhales ] Losing someone we love is painful. Agonizing even unto death. The Japanese call it tako-tsubo – a grieving surge of abnormal electrical waves that causes the heart to deflate and contort until it resembles a a fishing pot. Hollow and cold, an empty vessel at the bottom of a fathomless sea. I’m sorry for your loss. You have suffered enough of that in your life.
The man you killed at the massage parlor was an associate of mine. You didn’t know him, you didn’t rob him. Someone hired you to assassinate him.
Who?
[ Pause ] Thank you. Natalie, do you mind if I sit here for a moment? For the life of me, I don’t think I could get up right now.
Yes.
Stratos, we have to take the bitter with the sweet.
I have a lead on three cargo ships in Marseilles. If they are as advertised, we should purchase them. Your travel itinerary. I booked a room for you and Corina at La Madison de Mon Ami. A very quiet, lovely villa on the outskirts of Monte Carlo. I put $25,000 on account in their private casino. An anniversary present. Chin up, old friend. Drink some champagne, kiss on the balcony, tip well at the tables. We’ve been through worse.
Mediterranean shipping operations.
A courier of mine was murdered in Paris last night. A man named, killed by our next Blacklister.
For what?
I heard about Tom’s father. How did Tom react?
Good.
The woman you’ll be looking for is quite literally a character assassin. Her objective is to utterly obliterate her target by any means necessary. Scandal, public humiliation, extortion, theft, murder.
Yes. She’s ruthless and will go to any length to vanquish her victim with no regard for collateral damage.
I’m concerned.
I only know an alias. Isabella Stone.
You’re Elizabeth’s husband and Agnes’ father.
You need to stay away from Scottie Hargrave.
My question is “why not?” You have a wife and a child and a life. Leave well enough alone.
He’s dead, Tom.
I had a brief professional relationship with your father, a man who wrestled with significant demons. I know his wife, your mother, is a manipulative creature whose own husband didn’t trust her, whose answers to the questions you want to answer could never be trusted. All that really matters is that you vanished off the face of the earth nearly 30 years ago, and yet here you are. Leave the past in the past, Tom. Nothing good will come from digging up secrets.
Elizabeth.
Stratos?
I have to go. [ Hangs up ]
Stratos, listen to me. You’re in danger.
Stratos.
Stratos, listen to me. You and Corina, you’re in danger.
Stratos? Are you there? If you can hear me, get out of the hotel. Stratos? Stratos? Are you there?
He was framed.
I can count the things I envy in this life. Their relationship was one. Corina was his soul mate.
They’re not. But those bonds are traceable back to a shell company I own. A fact which I’m confident Isabella Stone will use to my disadvantage.
I first met Stratos Sarantos when he was running guns to Cypriot resistance fighters in 1987. For more than 20 years, he’s overseen my shipping concerns from the Bosphorus to the Suez Canal. He knows enough.
Stratos is very loyal. I’m not afraid he’ll talk. I’m afraid of what they’ll do to him when he won’t.
Your people are on site?
Isabella Stone is like Stratos to me. Baited the hook. Until he helps them reel me in, the only place he’s going is a very deep, dark hole.
Yes, absolutely I saw them. They took the damn thing right in front of me. They had the audacity to wave as they went away.
Uh, well, the one, the- The white one had a ponytail. The other, the black one, very worked out. He must drink a ton of those muscle shakes.
Gray Mercedes. CLS-550. License plate “B” as in boy. “A” as in apple–
That’s them. 100%. Ponytail. Muscle shake.
I can’t thank you enough. And I apologize in advance.
Drop it, please. And would you do me the courtesy of sliding it over? [ Gun slides ] Lovely.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Stratos.
Time to go, my friend.
Oh, we gotta get you out of here.
Yes, you can.
No. No, no, I’m not leaving you.
Whatever happens, whatever you do, just know your children will be cared for and your honor is intact.
Yes, but you failed.
I did what I thought was necessary.
Isabella Stone.
I’m told you have the location.
I need to speak with her the moment she’s detained.
I wasn’t asking permission.
[ Sighs ]
I don’t know how to respond to that.
I was relieved to hear about Justin. He’s a good man.
Only in so far as I’ve made substantial anonymous contributions to his foundation. But there have never been any strings attached. I consider Justin to be a saint. Or as close to a saint as one can be in this world.
I met him a decade ago in West Africa. The WHO and the Gabonese Ministry of Health had declared a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in the Ogooué-Ivindo Province. I happened to be in the area transporting materials to the Congolese border when we ran into an improvised roadblock of broken crates and rusty barrels. And I ordered my men to clear the road, when out steps this young, skinny kid, fresh out of Harvard Medical School. Justin hadn’t yet lost the use of his limbs. Although, even then, he was showing early signs of the ALS that would eventually claim his mobility. But he was fearless. A lion. He demanded to commandeer our convoy in order to transport refugees to Ekata. He was unarmed. I had a security detail of a dozen international battle-hardened mercenaries.
In the face of that kind of will, I re-organized my cargo and complied with his demands. What progress have you made with Isabella Stone?
The truth will out. It always does.
For Agnes.
You’ll find your time with her goes by too quickly. That’s why cuckoo clocks are perfect. I don’t really care what time it is. I just want to hear the birds sing.
Isabella, we have much to talk about.
You’ve murdered my friends and colleagues. You blackmailed a man I hold in the highest esteem. You seem to have a comprehensive knowledge of my life that you could only realize through an association with someone close to me.
I want to know who hired you.
Most people think the danger in a situation like this is the cold. The more immediate danger is the oxygen supply. Answer my question, or you will suffocate long before you freeze to death.
I want a name.
Harold, what can I do for you?
[ Innocently ] Which prisoner?
She’s perfectly safe. I have every intention of returning her to your custody as soon as she’s given me the information I need.
They’re bluffing.
Harold, what’s happening here? You sound desperate.
You aren’t being naive–
You can’t just order up super-criminals like Chinese takeout, Harold.
The Architect. 
There’s a man I know who works as a docent in a small museum in the Northwest. He recently remarried. Rotary Tuesdays. Euchre Fridays. A modest but happy life.
Gavin was a brilliant accountant. And an even better man. Who worshiped you. When the Feds came asking questions about the nature of his relationship with me, his only thoughts were about whether you and your children would be safe and well provided for.
I didn’t kill your husband. I helped him walk away from everything he loved to protect you and your innocence. Ironic.
Who hired you?
And your payment?
He’s married.
He remembers you as you were. To show him what you’ve become would be devastating. I’m not gonna tell you where he is. But I will turn the heat up. You must be chilled to the bone. 
I need to speak with Aram.
It’s urgent, Lizzy.
To direct you to a warehouse in Annapolis operated by Newcastle Ice.
An ice queen– Isabella Stone– returned as promised.
Only that we share the same bank. One that guarantees its depositors absolute privacy. I was hoping Aram could pull aside that veil of secrecy.
As I told Harold when he browbeat me for a Blacklister, I’m otherwise occupied and in no position to assist. Sending Aram after The Architect was reckless. His absence complicates matters for me.
And why do you want to appease them so badly? Will we ever find that out? 
I wouldn’t have come if the circumstances weren’t extraordinary.
David, I need you to help me identify a depositor at the bank.
David, an account holder at your bank has stolen my money, damaged my businesses, and killed my associates. I have the credit stick the depositor used to finance this bit of nastiness, but the data is encrypted and I can’t access it. I need your help. I need a name.
I need a name.
David, please.
David, it’s a painting. What I’m talking about is life and death.
Ah. Oh, God, I love the smell of oil paint. Ahh. Almost more than gasoline. Why are there certain toxic smells that just grab you that way?
Uh, “kidnapping”?
You speak Italian?
Of course there was. Tell Polpetto I’m a great admirer of his work. Mm, not so much his nudes. They’re a hair splayed for my tastes. And that I do apologize, but I require his services.
Oh, my goodness. This is tedious. I’d give almost anything to have a scratch. But seeing as how, given your profession, David, you might be more inclined to squeeze them rather than scratch them, I won’t impose. I’ll just wait for the next break.
I only brought him here to leverage you to kill him unless you give me the name of the depositor who has declared war, but once I properly introduced myself, the little fellow just lit right up.
He needed the canvas. Turns out he’s a huge fan of spaghetti Westerns– the antihero, the outlaw, you know.
[ Laughs ] He is the sweetest man. It’s gonna break my heart to put a bullet in his head, but that’s what will happen unless you tell me who at your bank is coming after me.
I would. In fact, what better way to assure my place in history? The last portrait by a master, unfinished, killed by his subject. And you without a portrait at all. It’s a shame.
We’ll see how the portrait turns out. 
Harold, it troubles me that you’re dissatisfied with the results of our efforts.
I’m sorry about your daughter. You’ve never spoken of her around me, which of course I understand, but you’ve seemed anxious of late. When someone you love is sick, you don’t need to shoulder that burden alone.
[ Stammers ]
David.
What’d you find?
David, the name of the account holder who paid Isabella Stone– who is it?
That’s not possible.
One of our most trusted confidantes intends to do irrevocable damage to the organization. Needs to be confronted swiftly.
[ Swallows, exhales ] There’s a traitor in the family. I intend to find them.
[ Gasps, coughing loudly ]
Where am I?
[ Groans ] What’s going on?
[ Gasping ] Why can’t– why can’t I breathe?
[ Gasping ]
[ Gasps ] Dinner, restaurant. [ Gasping ] What’s wrong with me?
Where’s Dembe? Dembe will know.
I don’t remember.
[ Exhales sharply ] How?
How long can you keep me alive?
[ Exhales sharply ]
Your cellphone. Do you have a cellphone? 
[ On phone ] Elizabeth. Gather the task force. I need your help – to solve a murder. 
[ Coughs ]
Your prayers have been answered, Donald. [ Takes pills, swallows ] Ah. Apparently, I’m dying.
No, no, no. I’m fine. I’ve been poisoned.
Someone within my organization. Someone with access to an offshore account that was used to fund recent attacks against me. 11 people had access to that account. Last evening, I called those 11 to a dinner to confront them. What happened next, I only remember pieces. The restaurant, what it looked like, not where it was. I remember holding a glass of wine, but not drinking it, although I’m sure I must have.
Missing. I assume searching for or in the hands of the person who wants me dead.
They can’t identify the toxin.
I’ve been told I have a day, two at most.
I need you to find the pharmaco-toxicologist who, I believe, crafted the deadly cocktail and get the antidote from him.
Well– [ Coughs ]
[ Grunts ] The Apothecary.
The Apothecary can create embolisms, aneurysms, inhibit respiration, induce paralysis. All of the assassins you know about share one common disadvantage when it comes to avoiding apprehension – they leave behind a corpse. And yet, there are times when a prolonged coma or a protracted illness – will get the job done just as well.
Ilario Panetti.
He’s about to go up on RICO charges. The government’s star witness against him has rather conveniently fallen into a coma. I believe Panetti has availed himself of the Apothecary’s services. Be quick. I don’t have the luxury of time.
To find Dembe. While you try to save my life, I’ll spend what time I have saving his. 
[ On phone ] 11 people had access to that account. I don’t know where they are. [ Dialing ] Hideki, where the hell are you? I need to speak with you right away. Call me as soon as you possibly can. He never showed up. Can you– [ Phone beeps ] Right. Can you reach him? No, no, no. Put Sidney on the line. Do you know where he went? Yes, yes, yes. As soon as you hear. [ Inhales deeply ] [ Coughs, exhales ] 
Doctor.
The night I-I was poisoned, last night. I can’t remember–
The night I was poisoned, I was with people. I don’t know where they are. I have called. I-I can’t reach them– except you.
You know how I was brought in.
How ’bout the– a man who brought me in?
Black. African accent.
Was it him?
How did we get there?
Hello? [ Red sees signs of a struggle ]
Who are you? Who put you in there?
[ Coughing ] When did I meet you?
Humor me.
[ Coughs ]
Here? I-I, uh– Who lives here?
Right. I know this is – [ Clears throat ] – an unusual, frightening predicament. But I assure you, I mean you no harm.
[ Coughing ] What is your name?
[ Coughing ]
[ Exhales ] Was I alone last night, or was I accompanied by – anybody – my associate? Uh, Dembe.
[ Coughing violently ] No.
I don’t know.
[ Coughing continues ] 
We’re looking for corticosteroids, bronchodilator. [ Coughing ]
Oh– Go, go, go. I’m fine. [ Panting, gasping ] [ Exhales, breathing heavily ]
Oh. I’ve lived my entire adult life surrounded by – a corona of death. Some days I’ve even longed for it. [ Cap pops open ] But lately, I– I find I’m– [ Pills rattle ] I’m unwilling to go gentle into that good night.
[ Coughs ] So are the police on their way?
[ Coughs ] Elizabeth.
I don’t know. Maybe. Tell me your name again.
Lou Lou. You saved my life, Lou Lou. Thank you.
[ Inhales sharply ] Well, it was remarkably generous given that I locked you in the trunk of a car.
[ Coughing ] [ Lou Lou hands Red the bronchodilator. He inhales deeply ] [ Exhales ] I’ve been poisoned– by someone close to me. I need to figure out by who. What happened last night? I can’t remember.
Why?
He’s my attorney.
What were we doing here? [ Coughs ] [ Pills rattle ] [ Cap pops open ] Becky. I took you to Marvin’s fiancée’s house.
[ Groans ] John’s.
You’ve been– kind to an extraordinary degree considering how we began our acquaintance. But I won’t drag you any further into this. You don’t deserve that. I’ll take it from here. [ Inhales deeply from the bronchodilator ]
[ Exhales ] What happened here?
Three of my accountants, a couple of money launderers, a handful of – investment advisors and bankers. Believe me, David, no one wants an explanation more than I. Please. Accept my apologies. Just take me back to the dinner and– tell me what happened.
Thank you all for coming on such short notice. I must admit, I’ve never had the pleasure of dining in this particular establishment before. I do wish we could enjoy it under more auspicious circumstances, but so be it.
[ Coughs ]
[ Coughing ]
Ironic, isn’t it? That the ones in whom we place our greatest trust are best positioned to put the knife in our backs.
The 11 people to whom I extended invitations tonight were the only ones who could have accessed that particular account. One of those 11 is a traitor, and only 10 of you are here. Perhaps our Judas didn’t have the nerve to attend this last supper. Well, I can assure you, I will find the guilty party, and he or she will be held accountable. Cheers.
The wine. I had a glass of wine at the dinner. Was it from one of these bottles?
What bottle? [ Coughs ]
[ Reads: ] Marvin Gerard.
Elizabeth, where are you?
Have you i-identified the toxin?
[ Coughs ] [ Groans ] Elizabeth, I found the wine that was used to administer the poison. One of my men is bringing it to you now. If the Apothecary doesn’t tell you what you need to know, the bottle will.
[ Coughing ]
[ Coughing continues ]
[ Coughing violently ] Oh!
Did you find Marvin?
Tell me what happened.
Thank you, Glen. Good work. And Dembe?
Have Marvin taken to that address. [ Exhales ] 
Where’s Dembe?
[ To the guards: ] Please wait outside.
Unfortunately, for this grand pantomime of innocence, I know a great deal about all of it. I know about the wine. I know about you hiring Isabella Stone. About Zack Smoll, Stratos and his wife. I know that you were one of very few people who had access to the account that financed the attacks against me. I know that’s why you didn’t come to dinner. The only thing I don’t know is what you’ve done with Dembe.
Tell me where Dembe is.
[ Inhales sharply ] I shouldn’t be surprised. We’re criminals, after all. It’s in our nature to betray.
Remember that wretched bit of business on the Malay Peninsula? I was positive I would rot alone in that holding cell in Surat Thani. Slowly eaten alive by mosquitos to the constant refrain of body blows and screaming. 47 interminable days of near-constant rain. I couldn’t be sure any of my messages had been dispatched. And then, on the 48th day, they swung the cell door wide and handed me a package. Half a dozen tins of chilled Beluga caviar and a note. “Love, Marvin.” When I think of it – guards on two continents – the bribes alone must have cost you a fortune. I still cannot fathom how you managed to pull it off from inside a federal prison. But you had my undying gratitude, so when the opportunity arose, I facilitated your freedom.
We’ll get to why soon enough. But first, I need to know about Dembe.
Yes?
That’s not possible. Check again.
Scotch.
I did. [ Uncorks and sniffs the Scotch bottle, recalls drinking it ] But there were only two people who had access to the bottle. And I’m one of them.
[ Inhales ] No, it can’t be.
That can’t be.
Why? What’s happened?
Aram?
Dembe has taken a calculated risk abducting Agent Mojtabai. He wouldn’t have done that to harm him, but to use him. For the time being, Aram is perfectly safe.
I am now. Aram’s abduction presents a rare opportunity.
Few can truly comprehend the fierce tenacity of a man like Dembe Zuma. I taught Dembe everything I knew regarding the tactics of evasion and survival. And now, despite dedicating every resource at my disposal to finding him, he has completely eluded detection.
[ Continues ] Dembe’s timing is impeccable. And his most deadly attribute is patience. Which is why Aram’s abduction presents two trails. And clearly, two very motivated parties to follow them. You focus on locating Aram and leave me free to find Dembe. With any luck, we’ll meet where the paths converge.
To find the Sanctum Corporation. A refuge, an enterprise that specializes in relocating criminals who are on the verge of being arrested or being dispatched by an adversary. An underground railroad for miscreants.
Not for himself. Last year, Matias Solomon used Dembe’s family as leverage against him to get to me. Afterward, I told him to hide his daughter and granddaughter.
I wanted Dembe to pick a vendor I knew nothing about to keep his family as far from my world as possible. He did as I instructed– so well, in fact, that I haven’t been able to identify the vendor he contracted. Sanctum is the last on my list.
[ Scoffs ] I have no idea. But I’ve tracked down someone who’s used them. Richard Fickman. A fence known for moving uncut diamonds. Disappeared after botching a shipment for a Yakuza Oyabun. We share a podiatrist. Chatty fellow. Apparently, Sanctum set him up selling discount men’s suits. 
I don’t believe in coincidence. Someone wants to obstruct my path. Baz. Phone. [ Click ] [ Speed dialing ] Glen. I need an appointment. Today. 
I’m in no mood, Glen. Did you access the footage I asked for?
Good afternoon, Chuck.
Someone with a schedule that leaves demonstrably less time to hit the gym than you. Let’s see if it’s been worth it.
Richard Fickman.
That’s unfortunate. Who put you up to it?
Was it the Sanctum Corporation?
How did you find him?
Who hired you to kill him?
Who?
Please go on.
She must’ve given you a way to contact her to confirm the job was done.
We’re done here.
We don’t have time for this. Baz.
How about the last parolee for whom the good doctor testified?
And he was released?
Except his name isn’t Alex Sato. It’s Daniel Nakamoto, a master forger of antiquities. 13 years ago, he was paid a pile of money for a cuneiform tablet by the boss of the Sacriponti crime family. Daniel claimed the tablet was part of the Sippar Library. What Daniel didn’t know and what Mr. Sacriponti was rather upset to learn, was that two weeks earlier, looters had broken into Iraq’s Museum of Antiquities and destroyed the entire collection.
Daniel Nakamoto disappeared shortly after.
I don’t know. But if Sanctum helped him disappear, only they can make him reappear.
I have no idea. But she certainly understands the dynamics of leverage. She gives these prisoners freedom in exchange for murder. I’m sure many of them would feel it’s a small price to pay.
Circling his prey.
Afternoon, Daniel.
Oh, I assure you, I have not. In fact, I’m something of a fan of your work. I saw a Xuande Ming urn you fabricated fetch quite a price at the King Family’s final auction. It was near perfect.
Now that we’re speaking plainly, I’m afraid your cover has been blown. I suppose that’s fairly obvious at this point. But nonetheless, I’m here to tell you that an assassin is coming to kill you.
The Sanctum Corporation has given you up. But I’m willing to help you vanish again in exchange for–
I’m warning you, Daniel. Your life is in grave danger.
Everything you can tell me about the Sanctum Corporation.
Thank you, Daniel. I suggest you return home and pack your things. I’ll be in touch.
Glen. I need information on a deceased couple. Tony and Maria Lopez of Ohio. They were apiarists.
Apiarists. Bees. 
You got to be kidding me.
This lacks even a modicum of discretion.
What did you find?
Then that’s where we’re headed. [ Spanish: ] Please, stop at the corner.
] [ Laughs ] [ Spanish ] Good luck with your test.
Fascinating. I hope you don’t mind me diving right in. I’ve been looking for you for quite a while, and time is of the essence. 
It’s hypnotic.
You knew I’d get to you eventually. I’m not one of your parents’ clients.
We just don’t know why.
There’s an entry in that ledger I need to see. For your sake, I hope it’s not crossed off. 
I need to be the judge of that.
People run when they’re scared and when they’re guilty. You can afford to hope for the best, but to survive in my world, I assume the worst. 
Hello, Isabella.
I need to speak with your father, Isabella.
I don’t know.
I hope not, but I won’t know until I find him.
He does not, but I have to. And I must insist on your help to do so.
He didn’t. [ Dialing ]
Yes, she’s okay.
Trying to find you.
They’re perfectly safe. What are you doing, Dembe? Because everything you seem to be doing is making you look guilty.
Who– who’s not? What are you saying?
Dembe? Dembe? Dembe?
What did you and Dembe find, Aram?
I spoke to him. He began to tell me something. But he was attacked.
The person he thinks is coming for me, it may be a woman.
He released you. Why? Did you discover something?
[ Shocked ] S-Say that again.
I’ll find him. I’ll find him.
A man’s greatest enemy is the dark forces pent up within himself. But not for me. My dark forces had a name. A person I entrusted with the most heinous offenses of my life. Every trespass I committed, expunged. Cleansed as if it had never happened. My confessor who doth now condemn me.
[ Clicks tongue ] Kathryn Nemec.
A name that came to represent my darkest hours. My friend. [ Smacks lips ] Mr. Kaplan.
When I pulled the trigger, I– I left without checking. I would never have been so careless if there wasn’t a part of me that wished I hadn’t done what I had just done. It’s been her all along. Retribution for what I did to her.
All I know is I need to find Dembe. 
I’m sorry, Dembe.
Where did you last see him?
You need a doctor. Keep that tight.
I am. He’ll lead me to Kate. Get Dembe to a hospital, please.
We should double back, find another path. This is all too exposed.
You must know my friend Kate. 
I can appreciate the kindness you showed to an injured woman in need. It’s commendable, as is your loyalty to her. Even under the threat of death. But you do need to call her.
Yes, that was a mistake I won’t make again. Call her.
This may seem ironic considering the circumstances, but I abhor violence. I only resort to it in times of extreme necessity. So believe me when I say, this is both extreme and necessary.
Call her.
She said I’d do what exactly?
Baz!
I’m not as unknown as you might like to believe, Ms. Nemec. We shared the affection of Katarina. We have a common bond in Elizabeth. I presume your love for the child abides. After Katarina’s sudden departure, I felt a responsibility to watch over the girl from a distance. I’ve provided for her and Sam financially.
I make no apologies for who I am or what I do. Katarina was a traitor to two countries, both global superpowers. God willing, Katarina’s daughter will live a private life of quiet courage. But if anyone learns her identity, the only way I can stop the threats from rising is to rise up as a greater threat than all of them.
Yes, Kate. Help me protect the girl we love.
A trusted voice. A cool head. Undaunted initiative in a messy situation. All the things that you gave to Elizabeth’s mother.
Yes. I would insist on that. 
I’m aware of your feelings, Kate.
As I feared would happen, elements from Katarina’s past are circling Elizabeth like a pack of wolves in the night. I put Tom Keen in her life to keep an eye on her, and he married her.
Indeed, I need to control the danger to Elizabeth. I’ve built a vast criminal network predicated on that very principal. It’s time to live up to my mission statement. 
Yeah. Well, we’ll see about that. [ Chuckles ]
Hello, Kate. Took some searching. We found your friend’s phone buried in the rubble.
He would’ve made you proud right to the end. You know how to engender loyalty in others, Kate. You always have.
Happy thoughts?
They’re one and the same. They always have been. What we’ve done, we’ve done for her.
It wasn’t best. You almost got her killed, and you betrayed me.
It’s time for us to meet and talk.
Are you familiar with Master James of St. George? Favored architect of Edward I. You know why? Concentric construction. He literally built castles within castles. Impossible to penetrate. You could breach the outer wall only to be faced with a heavily fortified gatehouse and barbican and a high inner wall lined with archers. Pity the poor foot soldier who made it that far. The architecture of my organization has risen stone by stone over decades. You can’t get inside to hurt me, Kate.
You’ve been busy. 
Excuse me. Carl? Sorry to bother you at work. Ethan Begby. Sheriff gave me your name and address.
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing like that. I’m looking for my aunt Kate. I understand you picked her up along the highway a few months ago. Apparently, someone happened to spot her in your truck and mentioned it to the sheriff.
Ah, I was afraid of that. We think she was in an accident. We found her car in a ravine along with her medication. Sweet as pie, Kate. And still fairly sharp when she’s on her meds. But without those pills–
Oh, I’m so sorry. It’s a terrible, terrible thing. The whole family’s been frantic since she disappeared.
Yes? Where was that exactly? 
 Good afternoon. I’d like to inquire about one of your previous guests.
Officer Simmons. State Police.
I’m looking for a woman traveling alone. She’s gone missing, and all evidence indicates she may have stayed here on the night of November 10th. I’m hoping you have some record.
I need to look at that room.
Yeah?
What? How?
It would seem Kate has started her endgame. Pull the fire alarm, Marvin. Let the others know. Go to ground.
That includes you. Wherever you are, leave. Assume you’ve been made.
You’re not safe. Nobody is. I’ll be in touch.
You’re entirely too helpful. I wanna hear those tapes.
I’m not here to judge. I just need to hear Sheila’s tape.
She uses a mononym Philomena. This woman has elevated the rickety practice of bounty hunting to a sort of performance art. One of the most effective ways to retrieve an unwilling target is to slip under their radar, get close, make a friend. That’s where Philomena shines.
Yes. Unfortunately, Mr. Kaplan’s efforts ran counter to her intended consequence.
I’m sure they have.
Not an innocent bystander in the bunch, Harold. Still [ Inhales sharply ] 86. I suppose it’s lucky they haven’t started popping up overseas. Still in all, the problem we’re talking about, Harold, is a political one. Rest assured, your government will sweep this whole tawdry mess under a rug, providing we continue to deliver the goods on my list. So – Philomena. After studying her subject for weeks or even months and acquiring whatever skills she might need along the way, Philomena enters her target’s life
… as if by mere coincidence or accident.
Philomena’s patience and subtlety are what make her so credible.
Joe Peracchio, yes. And if my instincts are correct, she’s going after more of my people right now. I’m off to see an individual who I believe also employed her services. I suggest that you start at the bar where Peracchio was last seen.
So I get a babysitter now? I haven’t had a babysitter since Brenda Gilroy. My God, pot pies, Lawrence Welk, bath time with Brenda. Still my perfect Saturday night.
Excellent, excellent.
Yes, congratulations, Congressman Edelstein. Aron’s going to make you and your wife very, very proud.
Howard Klein. The Swidlow bris. It’s okay. Just consider me a fellow traveler, one who understands and appreciates the importance of strong family bonds and the critical role these milestones play in forging them.
And well worth defending, by the way. Or hiring someone to defend. Like, uh, ah, Philomena, for instance.
You engaged Philomena to compromise a certain tennis instructor at the Town & Country Racquet Club who was carrying on a long-term fervid affair with your wife, thereby preserving your marriage for this happy occasion. I believe his name was Chip. What kind of name is that? Chip? Is that short for something? Chipper, Chipwick or–
All I want is to know the means by which you contacted Philomena. Consider it a mitzvah.
Tell me, how’s Tom?
Is he?
How’s Agnes?
May I come up and see her?
Name it.
It wasn’t about you. She made her choice. Her. Not you.
I can’t do that, Elizabeth.
With you down for the count the last few days, I’ve felt the consequences of your absence on my soul.
No, no, no, not now. They’re not shoes. A parting gift.
Most of my associates are under the impression that once I’ve granted them a favor, they’re indebted to me for life. But it’s a false assumption. They’re indebted to me because I make them a lot of money. They’re loyal to me because I’ve earned it. It’s good business.
But you can. At any point of your own choosing, I’ll insist that you do. No questions asked, no debts accrued, with our friendship intact and flourishing. For we’ll have new lands to discover. Not as coworkers, but as cohorts. Whether that’s today or tomorrow or 10 years from now, that’s when you open the box.
You’re the dirty rat, Diane.
What’s going on?
No, first, secure Marvin. I’ll call to alert him you’re coming. Once he’s safe, you see to the sister. Write down this address.
You’ve been targeted, Marvin. Our people are on their way.
Until they arrive, don’t let anyone in. Marvin?
Ah! Springtime in Vienna. The market’s are a bit crowded, but the flowers – oh, my gosh. A simple walk to the U-Bahn is full of glory. I’ll let you two talk.
Excellent work, Agent Keen.
The fingerprint?
I assure you I know nothing of it.
What are you doing here?
You should be resting.
Okay. Let’s get some supper first.
Ah, I hate Mozart.
Just heard too much of it. It’s like pop music to me. Kate, on the other hand, simply adores “Don Giovanni.”*
That was taken 18 hours ago at the Café Grundstein in Vienna, where Mozart held one of his last public performances. In the end, we’re all creatures of habit.
Dr Bogdan Ivanovich Krilov. One of the few people who have mastered the science of memory manipulation.
You of all people should know the answer to that.
The memory of an accident, a tragedy, a fire in which a 4-year-old girl killed her father.
That’s how Kaplan knows him.
I don’t know. But we have to find out, which is why the next name on the Blacklist is Dr. Krilov.
Hello.
[ Speaks German: ] Two pieces of Sachertorte, please.
Keep the change.
Perhaps I’ll add to the order. [ Shows a photo of Kate ] I’m looking for this woman. I represent the estate of a dear aunt who left her a sizable bequest. I was hoping you might have some information that would help me find her.
Thank you, my dear. We’ll take the Sachertorte to go.
You found him! Grand. Please, sit.
Marvelous. I have such a fondness for the little snacks from the bar car, the crackers and cheeses, the sausages. It’s like camping. Try the peppered one there. It’s surprisingly good.
He does. But he’ll have little use for it so long as you assist me in locating a passenger. [ He shows the Conductor a photo of Kate ] Her name is unimportant, as her ticket was likely purchased under any number of aliases, which is why I’ll need to see all of the various passenger manifests leaving from Wien Mitte.
How long has it been since your rail line has had a robbery?
A robbery, a stickup, like the Old West.
I’m talking about making you stop this train while my associate and I rob your passengers of their money and jewelry. I must admit, I’ve always been somewhat seduced by the idea. Bill Miner, the old gray fox. Butch Cassidy. But I’ve never really felt the itch until now. So you’re gonna walk back to wherever it is you walk to and get the manifests, or I’m gonna stop this train, take your money, and give this rail line the most ridiculous PR disaster since the Newton Boys robbed that mail train in Rondout.
Here. Susan Stahley.
The woman – there was a woman.
Thank you.
You can’t keep up this wild goose chase, Kate. I’m gonna find you.
[ Aside, to Dembe ] We’re gonna need the jet. Call Edward. Tell him we’re getting off at the next station.
Kate.
Kaplan sent Krilov to Orchard? I don’t like the connection.
I don’t know. Not long ago, the idea that Kate would hurt you as a way to get to me was unthinkable. But the Kate I’m after now is difficult to recognize. The bodies, the ones Julian Gale is investigating, I need the list.
The FBI’s forensic experts are trying to identify the remains. I need a list of the ones who’ve been identified so far. As quickly as you can and send it to Dembe.
Hans.
Kate. You made good time.
You don’t need to do this.
He was Werner’s son. A formidable young man, early 20s, already in the family business. Understand this was 25 years ago now. I was younger, myself. Intent on building an empire, intent on becoming the powerful criminal the world had been told I already was. Werner was very impressive to me then. International weapons dealer, a smuggler, a jack of almost every illicit trade one might imagine. I wanted an alliance – to become Werner’s most trusted associate.
The idea was simple enough, to make it appear as if Hans had been kidnapped, to send Werner a ransom demand. $10 million or his son would be killed. At that point, I would intervene, talk to the brutal abductors, convince them they should release Hans unharmed. They would agree, of course, out of respect to me and my reputation as a man not to be crossed. Werner would be deeply grateful. And so, my enemy would become my friend.
Horrified. Devastated. In a rage, I obliterated the Taddicken Brothers. And Mr. Kaplan saw to the disposal of Hans’s body. Werner was beyond bereft. But he was also very grateful to me – the man who had killed the animals responsible for murdering his only son. It remains one of my most profound regrets. But, of course, I never told Werner the truth. Instead, we began one of the most profitable alliances in modern criminal history. An alliance that has remained intact for decades.
No. But Werner won’t see it that way, will he?
I have no alternative.
I’ll handle Werner. It’s Kate who has me on tenterhooks. We put out one fire, she starts another. The woman is an arsonist. She’s not gonna stop until she burns me to the ground.
Since today. [ To one of the guards ] Nikolaus, how are you, my friend?
Change in protocol, I see.
Werner. Thank you for agreeing to hear me out.
A tragedy.
I deserve to pay. But I can’t.
I never underestimated you, Werner. I just hoped things could work out.
Nikolaus has been on my payroll since I introduced him to you 25 years ago. I knew one day we would have to look each other in the eye and face the truth. And I knew it would be an event that one of us would not recover from. Your abiding love for your son was always evident to me, Werner. The loss of Hans– There are no words to duly express my remorse. I’m sorry for that. And I’m– I’m sorry for this.
Thank you for your loyalty, Nikolaus. I’ll be in touch.
The jet is sitting on one of Werner’s air strips. No doubt his men are on it right now drinking my Scotch and seeing who fits in my suits.
Without Werner or his contacts, shipping lanes, airfields, I can’t do anything from Gibraltar to the Urals. Every piece of his machinery is up in the air now, and where they land is anybody’s guess. For the time being, we’ll have to be comfortable with chaos.
[ Exhaling ] Every part of this little drama, Kate, is playing out as grand tragedy.
Werner’s dead.
Goodbye, Kate.
Kaplan is using Krilov.
Nothing. She’s using him to pull at threads to continue to unravel my life. He sidelined Ressler. He’s trying to do the same to you.
Yes. When you were a child, to protect you from the memory of killing your father. I hired Krilov once. Never again.
Bogdan Krilov and Julian Gale, directly or indirectly, they’re working for Kaplan against us.
I’d think that would be a difficult distinction for you to make. Speak with him if you must. All I ask is that you don’t do it in anger. I wouldn’t want you to say anything either of us would regret.
Baldur!
Admiring your tasteful decor. You don’t spend much time here, do you?
You’re not still upset about our little misunderstanding, are you?
Prepared. I was prepared to kill you. Being prepared for something doesn’t necessarily speak to desire, and here we are. Congratulations. I’m told you’re opening offices in Paris and London. My accountant’s untimely demise left the door wide open for you to purchase that fleet of cruise ships for a song.
Yes. Werner’s death has cost me my travel routes in and out of the continent. And I’m sure whoever has my jet at the moment is trying to decide whether to keep it or at what astronomical price they’ll sell it back to me. In the meantime, I have urgent business in the States and no way to get there.
Are they? Baldur, you and I are deal-makers. We buy low and sell high. Getting that cruise line on the cheap was better than sex with your mistress. Either of them.
I’m a little down on my luck. A penny stock. Invest in me now and when I rise, you’ll be able to afford three mistresses.
Done. My goodness, I haven’t been in steerage since Li Yanping and I stowed away on a Chinese destroyer off the coast of Pulau Belitung.
He’s known as the Debt Collector, a mercenary paid to exact revenge.
All I can tell you is he’s coming to Washington.
No. Kate may be targeting people around you, but not you. Someone else put him up to this. Unfortunately, I’m in no position to help.
Not there. You need to take this to Cooper.
I’ve spent 30 years building an intelligence network of spies, informants, patriots, traitors. I’ve used it to build an empire that exists for only two reasons to keep me free and you safe. Elizabeth, I may not be there, but I have eyes and ears everywhere. And they tell me the Debt Collector is coming for you, which means he’s the next Blacklister.
Elizabeth, tell me something good.
We don’t have time.
Elizabeth, you can flip through every Rolodex at the Bureau, but when it comes to the matters of death and necropsy [ Cellphone ringing ] there is one technician who has gifts that simply cannot be matched.
Kate, I need your services.
I wish I were that clever. This is for Elizabeth. I need you to look at a body.
It’s true. Agnes is safe with my people, but it appears the Debt Collector grabbed Elizabeth before she made it to the safe house.
So did I.
Do you have him?
I don’t believe Kaplan is behind this. We’re not seeing the whole picture. Find your suspect and do it fast before he collects on whatever debt Elizabeth allegedly owes.
Traveling. I’ll do what I can from here, but my reach is limited. You need to find Elizabeth, Harold.
She’s gone, Kate. Elizabeth’s been taken.
You tell me. Her home was breached. Whatever our issues, please tell me you didn’t–
You may not have ordered her taken, but because of you, I am here. If Elizabeth is harmed because of all this–
Yes, Edgar Grant. And the FBI is doing everything they can. But he’s already got her. Whatever it takes, whatever you need, this conflict of ours can wait.
I am. I haven’t loved many people in my life. Kate is one of them. You know, as much as her betrayal hurt, what really hurt was [ Breathes sharply ] knowing what I would have to do in response. She was wrong to think Elizabeth and her child were safer without me in their lives. But in the end, she was [ Inhales sharply ] she did what she did out of love for the little girl she swore to protect what seems like a lifetime ago.
I agree. I’m just not at all sure of the right way. And depending on the way, whether I’d be up to it. I need to look her in the face and see if I still recognize her.
What if I’m the one who can’t see?
Have you called Harold Cooper?
Then call my people.
[ On phone ] We’re talking about Elizabeth. I guarantee you won’t be harmed.
If something goes wrong–
Please be careful, Kate.
 No need for alarm, Edgar.
I’m sorry to have misled you, but Tyson Pryor didn’t hire you. I did. Hello, Elizabeth.
From you? Nothing.
Yes. By taking advantage of her love for you. The only emotion powerful enough to get her to set aside the rage that consumes her. A rage that I’m not sure she’ll ever recover from.
That must’ve been dissatisfying for you. You’re a glutton for vengeance. I understand. There’s almost nothing as satisfying as revenge, wanting someone to hurt because you hurt. An eye for an eye. Feels like God’s work, until you realize there is no God and you’ve committed sins for which there is no absolution.
Word to the wise – before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.[ Gunshot 💥 ] [ Shell casing clatters ] [ Edgar falls ]
Confucius. Stunningly applicable even after all these years.
Neither, I hope. That’s up to her.
I thought I was until I was able to trade one of my last supply routes in the Balkans for a ride on Prince Hajjar’s jet.
Agnes was never at risk. And I gave explicit instructions you were not to be harmed in any way.
I wish I could.
I assume so, yes.
As I said, that’s entirely up to her. I want to believe there’s another way.
She doesn’t have to convince me. You already did that. But for a war to end, both sides have to be willing to find peace. And up until now, it seems Kate has believed the only satisfactory outcome would be if one of us dies. If that’s true, it has to be her.
[ Beep ] Pascal, she brought a lot of backup. Is this gonna be a problem?
[ Beep ] On my command, fire only if you have a clean shot. Remember, she is not to be harmed.
Hold.
[ Beep ] No. Hold.
Said the fly to the spider.
[ On phone ] We go where our hearts take us. Yours took you to Elizabeth.
You underestimate yourself, Kate. The deaths you’ve caused in the name of crippling me have been more than adequate to prove what you’ve become.
I wanted her here to bear witness. I regret any hardship it caused her, but I believe, in the end, she’ll agree it’s a small price to pay for the truth.
I’ll show you mine if she’ll show you hers.
[ On phone ] Any sign of Kate?
You let her get away.
Well, you heard it yourself. Her truth. That we cannot coexist.
So we have a new actor in the mix.
No. That’s what makes our mystery guest so intriguing.
I have found in my experience people rarely change. And when they do, they’re not to be trusted.
As I said, there’s been a slight delay at the border.
Salaam seems grouchy. Perhaps he’s hungry. God knows I’m starving. What the hell are we doing, standing around in this warehouse? Let’s get a meal, break bread, drink some Arak. When the shipment gets here, we’ll finish our business.
What is that supposed to mean?
What are they whispering?
The truck will be here.
Rhinehart, assure your client, as much as I detest him and his dirty little war, his shipment is en route and will get here when it gets here. However, if he expects to take delivery, he needs to put his gun back in his pants.
Tell him to put the gun down.
And what do you know?
What happened?
Indeed, the rats are fleeing, Dembe. If the payment wasn’t made, it’s because Kaplan’s making a run on the bank. Get Abe on the phone. Let’s find out what deals are in play.
[ On phone ] Livio, the deal will be fine. Things are nowhere near as bad as you’ve been led to believe. No. No. No, the Latvian route is defunct, which is fine. I-I’ve many other resources.
[ To Dembe ] Has she said anything? Call Brimley. [ To Livio on phone ] What? Yes, of course. I’m confirming that as we speak. [ Snaps fingers ] [ To Abe ] What the hell is going on with Bank Rheinfelden? 
[ On phone ] Yes. Yes. Von Hauser is gone, which is unfortunate, but indicative of nothing. I can assure you the passage is safe and the documents are clean.
Your only risk is if you step out now and your clients end up with inferior material or worse yet, end up in custody. Fine.
Well, what did he say?
I thought Kaplan was removed from the account.
Brimley. At last, a friendly face.
[ Laughs ]
There’s a woman in the other room. I need you to get her to divulge the name and the address of Kaplan’s new driver.
Please, we can discuss that later.
I need you, Teddy.
And then it’s rabbit stew for dinner.
And?
[ Voice-over ] Donald, I want you to know that I do understand how you feel.
Don Julio.
I miss Alonnisos. No money, shack on the beach, dreams of infamy.
Ha!
Don Julio, I’ve never known you to be brusque, certainly not at mealtime.
I have a name. Squeezed it out of a contractor in Kaplan’s employ. Phillip Roque. I understand he used to be your driver. If I get to him, I get to Kaplan.
Can’t or won’t?
That’s all you know?
Send my love to Chitra.
Incentive– the currency of politicians, dog trainers, and criminals.
I’m Raymond Reddington. I’m looking for a customer of yours– Phillip Roque. In the last four weeks, he purchased an automobile from one of you fine gentlemen, tricked out with all the bells and whistles. Anyone? No?  Perhaps an incentive.
You get to keep all your fingers and toes.
And who was that exactly? 
Hello, Abe.
You won’t be using that arm again. But it’s your left arm. I know you’re right-handed. I know that because we’ve worked together for 11 years. I know your wife has diabetes, that your daughter’s favorite animal is a hippo. I know you love Chinese food, that you eat it every Wednesday when you shack up with your girlfriend in her apartment above WuFat Noodle House. I know you skim an extra grand every week to help pay for that girlfriend.
Abe, you steal my money so you can get laid, which I’ve ignored because you’re an accounting wizard. What I cannot ignore is your betrayal. You are how Mr. Kaplan has drained my accounts.
Phillip Roque.
You wired money to buy him a car. Where is he?
Mario Dixon?
Who’s Mario Dixon?
[ To Dembe ] We have a new target.
Elizabeth, I need you to find out what you can about a Mario Dixon. Kaplan wired him $300,000 two days ago. Whatever her next move is, Dixon is helping her make it.
What do you know?
A warrant won’t be necessary. Just the address.
[ Laughs ] My land! Look at this, Dembe. Gaited trail saddle. Do we have any need for a saddle? Wouldn’t it go great with the chaps and the spurs? Look at that crescent wrench. How fun. What a handy little store.
[ Laughs ] Look at you. [ Wrench clatters ] What might this old thing be worth? [ Gun cocks ] Perhaps a trip to the back room? I trust there’s a back room.
Now this is more like it. [ Door creaks ] Where might we find Mr. Dixon?
You ever have one of those days when nothing goes right? People give you the runaround, everything seems to take twice the effort. The kind of day you’d kill to get your mojo back. I’m having one of those days. So you can either be honest with me about Mario Dixon or I can get behind the wheel of this fine automobile and run you over.
Dembe, call an ambulance. Why on earth would she do this?
Why did she take your eye?
To what? Where do you work?
I don’t know what that is. Stone Canyon. What’s stored there?
I was thinking about that poor soul whose eye you stole. What a shame. [ Inhales sharply ] Disfigured for life, caught up in all this nastiness.
Mr. Kaplan? I will, when you tell me where to find her.
She had you steal that agreement. Must’ve had a plan to bring it to her. You can tell me where and when, or you can tell him [ indicating Dembe ]. One way or another, the truth will come out.
There’s a “but.” Please, do go on.
In exchange for what? 
I didn’t touch him.
Yes. Southwest Waterfront. 5:00 PM. She’ll be there personally to take possession of the agreement.
Then you’ll just have to hurry, Elizabeth. I’ll be in touch as soon as I know more.
They’ll have time before the meet. I’m sorry. I have to go.
I have to take care of something. 5:00. The war ends tonight.
Perhaps.
Hello, Dom.
Yes, without me.
I know what it means.
I’m under attack, Dom. Most of my business has been destroyed, many of my people killed.
I’m trying. But regardless, this isn’t for me.
[ Grunts, exhales, pulls out a smaller metal box ] For Masha. She’s alive, Dom. I thought we lost her once. I won’t lose her again.
Dom, will you wait a second? You’re gonna give yourself a heart attack.
That’s not fair.
I wasn’t lying when I told you Masha was gone, I believed she had died in childbirth. She deceived me, faked her own death. At the time, she wanted to get away from me.
She had help from one of my people, a woman close to me who betrayed my trust. Dom, I know you’ve been conditioned to assume my selfishness. I’m sure that’s largely my fault. But this is different. This woman, she’s made it her mission to eliminate me, to remove me from Masha’s life, whatever the cost. And the truth is, she’s proven to be remarkably adept at killing the people closest to me. She knows everything about my operation. I kept her at my side for years. But the one thing she doesn’t know is you. I haven’t told you about Masha because I didn’t wanna risk coming here or making contact with you again until this fight was over.
You don’t have to say anything. You don’t have to believe me or help me or like me. You never have. I don’t know why you’d have to start now. But this isn’t about me, Dom. This is about Masha. If I don’t come back–
If I don’t come back, you need to find her, Dom. Tell her who you are.
I have to go. I’m sorry.
All of it. I wish I’d been the person you wanted me to be.
Elizabeth.
I’ll be taking that meeting alone.
I don’t know what the outcome will be.
You asked if I could promise you that I wouldn’t. I said no.
Where did Kaplan tell you to meet?
This is no mere box. Inside, you’ll find travel vouchers, security codes, boat keys, and ownership papers for a private 96-acre island off the coast of Brunei. It’s a self-sufficient turnkey property with a desalination well, a solar and wind farm, full-time waitstaff, a grounds crew, security team, and a property manager, all paid for in perpetuity by a very healthy trust fund. Paradise with no extradition treaty.
Right now, the island’s owner is legend. Nobody on the island knows who it belongs to. [ Opens box ] All they know is that one day, someone will arrive with a key that fits into an old lock on the front door. [ Holds up key ] Whosoever opens that lock with this key, the staff will loyally serve and the guards will forever defend against all comers. [ Latches click box shut ] The location of the meeting.
The box is actually intended for someone else.
Hello, Kate.
I have to hand it to you, you did it. My associates, my accounts, cash reserves– gone. About the only thing you left me is a hat on my head. And this. The way out.
Too many killings, Kate, on all sides. I don’t want more death, and neither do you. I simply want this to end. You can have the island.
Yes. In paradise. Elizabeth is who she is, Kate. She’s not Masha anymore. With little to none of my presence or influence through the years, she has grown up to be Special Agent Elizabeth Keen. Her area of scholarship and expertise is the study of criminals. The habits and inclinations, the curiosities and proclivities, the psychiatry of criminals. That’s who she is. That may be the world she was born to, but it is most certainly the world she has chosen to live in. I can continue to give her more distance, but she is going to continue to be who she is. And I’m not going to stop watching out for her. So either you go and save yourself, or this ends right here. Now.
Kate must’ve made a deal.
Once Kaplan testifies, an indictment is inevitable.
Harold has to work within the system. Henry Prescott does not.
A man who knows how to bury problems. If you find yourself up against impossible odds due to poor judgment, Henry Prescott’s the man you want on speed dial. He’s the courage you never had, cool head in a crisis.
Finding him is the key to sweeping the grand jury under the rug.
The House is back in session. Oh – and those are the charred remains of 16 false identities that Kate has somehow compromised. At the moment, my resources are scant, which is why I need your help in finding Prescott.
Four years ago, I surrendered to protect you. From Tom, Berlin, Cabal. And now you may go to jail because of me. It appears Kate may be right after all. Maybe I am the person you need protection from.
[ Walking in ] Mermaids!
Really? You’re not in Miami anymore.
Someone who knows better than to mix themes in an entertainment venue.
Ooh, that’s a long list. But at the moment, I’ll settle for Henry Prescott.
Well, let me ring it for you. A few months ago, you were tweaking on whatever you were tweaking on at that nightclub in Vegas and inadvertently discharged your handgun in the general direction of a crowded dance floor, sending a Belgian tourist to the emergency room. Henry Prescott is the man who made that all go away.
[ Laughing ] Yes. Yes. [ Click, gunshot 💥 Drug dealer falls ]
There. There’s a problem. Your drug dealer’s bleeding out on the floor in your VIP room of your new nightclub. With the morals clause in your new contract, you won’t collect a penny.
Henry Prescott. Call him.
I happened.
My apologies for the forced introduction, Mr. Prescott, but I require some information. On November 19, 2015, your services were engaged to pick up a package in Dupont Circle. I need you to tell me the exact disposition of that package.
Ah, come now. If you don’t give me the information I’ve requested, it’ll all be over.
I don’t have to. To be effective, people like you must operate from the shadows. Anonymity and discretion are your stock and trade. And I’m about to make you famous. Once you, Jay-Jay, and gunshot wound here make the headlines tomorrow, your phone will never ring again. Or you can tell me what I need to know. Where’s the package? 
Yes. He has something I think you’ll find of particular interest. Mr. Prescott, my associate, Frank Sturgeon. I’ll need him to confirm the findings.
A depository of sorts. Prescott’s insurance policies.
We’re looking for 11-19-15. You’ll want these.
And here we are.
I’m certain of it.
Ready? [ Barrel lid clatters ] Dive in.
Congratulations, Donald. Your hunt for Reven Wright is over.
Ah, the straw in the wind.
Yes, proving her guilt.
If we provide her with the proper motivation. I’m sorry, Donald, I know you’ve been longing to prove Hitchin’s guilt. But the only way to survive now that you finally have that proof is to trade it away.
Donald doesn’t cavort. In fact, I think you’ll find our little meeting today rather serious in tone.
There’s a federal grand jury investigating whether Donald and his task force have been enabling me to continue to commit crimes.
It seems inevitable that my immunity agreement will be revoked and the members of the task force will be indicted forthwith.
Fortunately, for us, our problem is your problem.
Unh-unh-unh-unh. As you can see, Laurel, Donald’s upset. And what has him wound tighter than a $2 watch? His impending indictment? No. It’s this. A slug the medical examiner just pulled out of Reven Wright’s body. You and I both know ballistics will match it to the Glock 19 in your nightstand, and as I understand it, Agent Ressler has a team standing by as we speak ready to enter your home and seize the firearm.
Let’s give Prescott a call so you can hear for yourself. With that bullet, Donald finally has what he’s been looking for since the day you killed Reven – irrefutable proof.
I see. Then we’ve wasted your time and ours. I do wonder what else Donald’s men will find in your nightstand. Are you a vibrator kind of gal, Laurel? We’ll see.
Deal.
Ah. Julian. It’s been a long time. You look fit. Jumping jacks?
When was the last time you and I saw each other? London? No. Cape Town? No, that’s not right. Don’t tell me. [ Laughs ] It’ll come. Ah.
As a matter of fact, I did. Ah, anyhoo, Mr Kaplan I need to know how to reach her.
She uses burner phones. You must have her latest number.
No, I’m gonna take your phone. [ Red takes Gale’s burner phone from the dashboard ] Ho Chi Minh City! [ Laughs ] That’s it. I got away from you aboard that catfish trawler on the Saigon River. My God, the humidity. But fun times indeed. More to come, Agent Gale.
More to come.
I’m gonna give you a cellphone number I need you to trace.
I haven’t been able to reach Elizabeth. Is she there?
Kaplan’s burner. If we find it, we find her, and I think Agent Keen. She doubted my plan, Harold. I believe she had another one in mind.
Who was relying on the grand jury to separate us. I fear Kaplan’s backup plan will be more extreme.
[ To Dembe ]  We need to take 501 North. [ To Cooper ] We’re closer. Keep us updated.
Hello, Kate.
You’re so focused on destroying me, you’re willing to hurt one of the few people you’ve ever loved.
I don’t know what that means.
What have you done?
Look around you, Kate. It’s over.
I don’t see what choice you have.
There’s one flaw in your plan, Kate. I’m not gonna hurt you. I never should’ve pulled that trigger in the first place. I certainly won’t now. Not again.
I won’t.
Kate!
Broke is such a harsh word. I prefer illiquid.
[ Inhales sharply ] Elizabeth, if you need to walk away–
I didn’t.
Yes.
Not yet.
It is gone.
We gotta find that goddamn suitcase.
It’s not here yet?
I had the maitre d’ call for my car about 20 minutes ago. I’m gonna be late, pal.
[ Scoffs ] The hell it has!
Now, wait a minute. I haven’t picked my car up. I’ve been in your restaurant eating lunch. A lemon-verbena iced tea and salmon salad, – which was overcooked, for what it’s worth.
And I’m certainly not one of these meatheads who tells you to keep it close. But if my Range Rover is gone–
The ticket is collateral for my $100,000 vehicle, and if it’s not– This is a waste of my time. I need to speak to your manager, okay?
I am so sorry. We’re having a little employee situation.
Elizabeth. How are you today?
Just bumped into a few old friends, just catching up.
Yes. [ Chuckles ] We’re outside. It’s very noisy here. Perhaps I could call you back.
Never been better. Hey, why don’t you drop by my new place. You’ll love the pool. I’ll send you the address. Sorry, sweetheart. I need to get off.
Yes. Yes, she is.
Like Bergita Olofson in her parents’ rumpus room on a Saturday night.
[ Laughs ] This should cover my outstanding debt, along with the rest of the month. And, Dariush, if it’s not too presumptuous, I’d like pay for drinks at tonight’s social hour.
Elizabeth. You’ve just missed the Ludeman family. I must’ve thrown quarters for that little girl to fetch for over two hours. Soda pop?
I make my bed where I lay my head.
I got to tell you, I’m thinking about making it permanent. Dariush, the owner and I, are somewhat the same size, which has been a Godsend. I think you’d quite like it here. They host a social hour at sunset– music and cocktails. It’s a lovely crowd, really. Eclectic, to say the least.
Dip your toes in. I swear Dariush keeps the pool at body temperature. You can’t even feel the water.
Oh. I didn’t realize you were here on official business.
Then I suppose I’ll need my pants.
Good afternoon.
I’ve always wanted to hunt for bounty.
And you’re a bail bondsman, which means you’re likely looking for a fugitive. I believe I can help.
Yes. Your biggest case. Who is it?
And as much as it pains me to hunt one of my own, it pains me more to admit I need the cash. So, a name.
How fun. Even better. I love a good carnival.
Harold needs a Blacklister. I need to pay the rent, and beggars can’t be choosers.
And we have one. [ To Maurice: ] Smokey Putnum. Please, do tell.
What do skip tracers usually get?
I couldn’t sleep right if I took a penny over 50%. $40,000, and I’ll have Smokey to court on time. Elizabeth, you’ll need to pack a bag. We’re taking a road trip.
Yes, please. I don’t have a car.
See you in 36.
Tell me you have news.
Dembe, one of Kaplan’s associates has to have it. We need to find that suitcase before it finds its way to Elizabeth.
Hello, Harold.
Have you ever had deep-fried butter?
Clogs more arteries than a car accident during rush hour, and, yet, people out here can’t get enough of it.
And you’ll have one soon, after we do a little rebuilding.
Perhaps you’re the one in need of some clarification. The Blacklist has value because it is based on the best possible intelligence – information that was not available yesterday and will be obsolete tomorrow. The criminal underworld is not static, Harold.
We’re looking for Joe Putnum, or “Smokey,” as they call him.
[ Laughs ] Ah. [ Grunts ] Wh-eaz-at, uh, d-eaz-id y-y-eaz-ou– Ah, the hell with it.
It’s a private language carnies use to keep outsiders from understanding what they’re talking about. I spent two summers operating the Whack-the-Cats at the Emmet County Fair. And to be honest, I had no idea what the hell any of them were saying. But I’m pretty sure this one was telling this one not to cooperate. Bad advice.
Why not? Putnum stole from you.
The lady asked you a question. TL? Who’s TL?
And where might we find Tammy Lynn? 
I’m sure you didn’t. Smokey still doesn’t know. Loretta spent her last five years trying to find him.
Just under a year ago, which is why we must find Mr. Putnum soon. If I can’t conclude the paperwork by week’s end, the entire inheritance will be forfeited to the state. Tammy Lynn, I’ve worked with Jacobson and Orr for 36 years. I have never seen an estate payout this big. We’re talking life-changing money.
Oh, dear. [ Stands up ] Where is he? [ Gun cocks ]
[ Loudly ] Mr. Putnum, you need to come out right now, or we’re gonna make a mess in Tammy Lynn’s living room.
Mr. Putnum? I’m gonna count to three. 1, 2, 3. [ Gunshot 💥 Red shoots into the ceiling ]
[ Gun cocks ] No? Let’s try again, shall we? [ Gunshot 💥 ]
Smokey? [ Chuckles ] Funny. The janitor at my elementary school was called “Smokey.” No idea why. He never smoked a day in his life. But I tell you what– If you don’t come down here right now, they’re gonna be calling you–
Now, there’s an entrance.
Tell me it’s true. The file says you were a gaffer with the Ringling Brothers. I’ve always been fascinated by your line of work.
Elizabeth, this man was responsible for moving the greatest show on earth from city to city. The Pentagon sent its top people to study his logistical legerdemain to learn how to move troops in and out of battle. Imagine the trains, all the performers, their equipment, the crew, roustabouts, the animal wranglers, veterinarians. An entire city moved at night. Not to mention the lions and tigers and bears, oh, my. What a showman. What a mind.
How do I know you still have it?
Fine. I’ll take it.
After I surrender you to the court and collect my bounty. Now, it’s just over 600 miles to DC, so if we push on, we should be there in 10, 12 hours. That said, if time permits, I would love to stop along the Bourbon Trail and try a Honey Ginger Buck.
Must be US Marshals.
If you do stop, they’ll search this car, and while it may be Mr. Putnum they’re after, they’ll be thrilled at their unexpected discovery.
Elizabeth, no.
Trouble. These aren’t Marshals. [ Gets out of car ] Elizabeth!
[ To Liz ] Get in!
They’re skinheads? What the hell do you mean, skinheads? Other than the fact that they happen to have skinheads?
The carnival?
So, your brilliant criminal enterprise was founded on the concept that you steal money from the most ruthless, bass-ackwards groups of racists you could possibly find?
No.
If the Feds take Putnum in, I don’t get my 40 grand.
If I give him to you, you’re gonna take him to the nearest FBI field office, where he’ll demand an identity hearing or fight extradition. In either case– He’ll miss his court date, and you won’t get your money.
Next one goes in your leg.
“Planned”? [ Laughs ] I don’t have the foggiest idea how to get you back. That’s what makes it fun– the surprises. Your carnival people, your skinheads, your mouth that won’t stop running. So buckle up, Smokey, because before this is over, you and I are gonna get to know each other better than either of us would like. And my 40 grand– I’m gonna enjoy earning every damn penny. Uncuff him.
I don’t know. I feel pretty good.
I feel alive. Zipping off in that car, bullets flying. What a thrill. [ Chuckles ] And the driving. Dembe’s always driving. I should do more driving. I am sorry about your car, however.
Good morning.
No, not yet. I do have a funny joke about Cincinnati, though. A priest, a rabbi, and Pete Rose walk into a casino and–
How is it?
I’m just happy you’re happy.
Just eat your pie.
Yes.
[ Cellphone rings ] Oh, it’s my boss. Well, that’s a sentence I never expected to say.
Maurice, great news. We have Putnum is custody.
Well, there was a slight hiccup in our plans. We’ll be taking the 2:00 PM Cardinal out of Cincinnati. Should arrive with plenty of time before the trial.
Train’s delayed again.
Another hour. We’re gonna miss the cut-off. I’m gonna find us a car.
I’m sorry, my dear, were you about to suggest something else?
Elizabeth, please keep an eye on our fugitive.
Let’s go.
I doubt he’s dead, and I think I know where to find him. Get in.
Mr. Putnum, go find your money. [ To LeMarc ] You, sit.
Mr. LeMarc, I understand you’re upset. You trusted a man to launder your criminal nastiness, and instead, he absconded with it. I’m here to make things right– a proposal. You get your money, and I get the man who took your money.
Because I have the guns.
[ To LeMarc ] Take your money and go.
I don’t want to get involved in your affairs, so if you take your money and leave, you’ll never see me again. And Mr. Putnum will not be telling anyone – the courts or otherwise – about the intricacies of your business operations. I’m his rabbi now. You’re free to go.
Mr. LeMarc was just leaving.
I put a bullet in your head and keep your money.
Mr. LeMarc, she won’t shoot you, but trust that I will. On three. 1, 2–
[ Chuckles ] Now, that’s a nasty look that takes practice. You must have sisters.
Mr. Putnum, I believe turning you in is the right thing, the legal thing. Do you agree, Elizabeth?
Right there.
For a moment there, I didn’t think we were gonna make it.
You weren’t willing to shoot an unarmed man in the back. I think that’s something to admire, not regret.
Because of his father? Perhaps. Or perhaps it’s the dumb luck of a gambler.
[ Laughs ]
What the hell? What happened? What’s going on?
I did. Thank you.
Please don’t make me return the car. I’ve always secretly wanted a Wagoneer. It smells like Dad’s car. Like peanut shells, gasoline. [ Laughs ] Elizabeth, if it helps to salve the wound, we did bring a fugitive to justice.
Hey, Morgan. Chuck. You have the package? Any trouble?
Make sure the guard gets his money. And thank you, guys. I’m in your debt.
Your Fairy Godmother.
Your deal with the prosecutor got your sentence reduced to four years. With me, it’s reduced to none. [ Handcuffs rattling ] Care to hear more?
That’s half of it. I’d be happy to explain, but there is something I need you to do for me first.
You may think you want to be off the pool, believe me, up and ba– Smokey! Hawkins: What the hell is he doing here?
Okay, take a breath. Let’s celebrate. Can a diabetic drink wine? – Dariush.
Earlier today, you two were both on your way to trial, to prison, and now, thanks to us, you’re both free. Free to greet opportunity knocking at your door.
Imagine owning 2% in a multi-national conglomerate with interests in travel, beverage, technology, cyber, defense, revolution, with gross profits that would be the envy of most companies in the Fortune 500.
Mine.
I have every confidence that the FBI is in the process of finding whatever rock LeMarc and his men are hiding under.
Hawkins here knows money laundering like the Pope knows the Bible. And you, Smokey– You know everything there is to know about logistics and tactics. It wasn’t your fault the greatest show on earth went out of business. That says more about lack of vision than anything else. And sure, you’re down on your luck and you made some poor choices that put a wedge between you, but I removed that wedge today. And if you’re as smart as I know you two are, you’ll agree to this proposal. And together, we’ll take a wild ride.
Yes? More wine! Help yourself to the pretzels and the cheeses. We’re all family here. [ Chuckles ]
Oh, my gosh.
So you get your bad guys, and I get mine.
How’d you do?
Dembe, that suitcase We need to find that suitcase.
Myron, I’m in your debt.
Your associates are buzzards. But you, my friend, will always be welcome at my table.
his man gets us to a man named Dennison, and Dennison gets us to the suitcase.
Harold, Elizabeth, please sit. Have a siu mai.
Greyson Blaise.
You want a Blacklister, I’m giving you one. Or are you here to play ColorKu? An absolutely infuriating game. Although, I do love the way it looks.
And raced at Le Mans and trekked across the Sahara and stole Van Gogh’s “Poppy Flowers” from a museum in Cairo.
A thrill-seeker. A Van Gogh in Cairo. A Picasso in Rio. And last night in New York, a necklace – The Napoleon necklace. Blaise is a rising star, and he’s using dark money in politics to spread his influence, buying loyalty for the inevitable day when the next thrill ride he chooses to go on is to run for something. King, perhaps.
There’s an auction in Zagreb 36 hours from now. I’m told Blaise will be there.
Yes. Unfortunately for you, Harold, I’m not telling you about Blaise so you can take him down.
I’m telling you about him so you can help me go into business with him.
Because you need a powerful CI, someone people fear. And if my world learns I’m aligned with Blaise, people will be terrified.
Which is why we must convince him that I’m not.
Who’s arguing? I need a ride, you’ve got a jet.
I know the rules, Donald.
This is fun. Out and about, a glass of bubbles
Truth be told, being stuck stateside has left me feeling somewhat smothered as of late. Oh, my goodness. Look at those Guan vases. And that flatware. Did you know Nancy Reagan – She could dress a table specifically for that night’s guest at a moment’s notice.
Let’s find a paddle card and a catalogue. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy dickering over an heirloom now and then.
I can’t resist.
Elizabeth, we’re at an auction. I have to bid on something.
Harold does, and it’s important for me to keep up appearances. I can’t go around looking like a party pooper.
Anything under 3 for the bronze Lincoln penny is highway robbery. It’s a steal.
Well, at least we got his attention.
Yes! But $3 million for a book of coins is a bit rich even for my blood.
If you’re struggling, you’re alive.
Anna, those are lovely earrings.
Cheers!
Rumor has it you may be in the mood to unload a certain waterway in the Aegean Sea.
Perhaps, or perhaps there’s a leak in the boat, Greyson– One we’d need to plug before hopping into the canoe together.
Yet you understand that running an enterprise such as mine requires a network of trade routes which could prove quite profitable to a man with your resources.
What am I thinking? This is neither the time nor the place to talk business. Let’s go somewhere, have a drink.
A nightcap – Amaro, perhaps?
Well, if you change your mind or care to see the Rembrandt, give me a call.
“Storm on the Sea of Galilee.”
[ Chuckles ] Missing? The thing’s hanging on the wall of my house on Lake Como. Oh, my gosh. That’s it. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it earlier. We’re having a get-together at the house Saturday. You should come.
It’s a fairly recent acquisition, papered, of course to ensure my privacy. I’m throwing a birthday party for a friend. Drinks in the garden. We can talk a little shop, and you can experience “Sea of Galilee” in the flesh.
I don’t.
It was the first thing that came to mind. I hope Harold’s still in the office. Can you call him?
That we need his checkbook. We’re throwing a party.
Because I told Greyson Blaise I was throwing a party. I-I’m sorry, I’m just so confused, Harold. Do you not like parties?
I had to say something.
The man is an art collector who has an opportunity to see a magnificent painting that’s been missing for 27 years. He’ll show.
Let me worry about the house and the party. I only need your assistance acquiring the painting.
Amalia Hammett sees it every day. It’s sitting on an easel in the living room of her apartment in Paris.
I brokered the sale.
The woman is in possession of a stolen work of art. The FBI can’t seize it in Europe, and while you could request a joint operation with the French, I’m not sure they’ll let you lend it to my estate on Lake Como. So yes, you should steal it.
I haven’t, but I will. Sometimes being notorious has its perks.
I know I’ve thrown a lot at you, so please, take time to discuss.
Ah, not take. Borrow.
We’ll let you two talk.
One doesn’t simply rent the kind of estate I would have on Lake Como. Besides, I told Blaise we had a garden. They’ll come around.
What?
Analia, who plays the piano?
I see. Please tell Paolo he’s hosting a party tomorrow afternoon. He can either drink champagne and tickle the ivories or spend the rest of the night locked in the wine cellar.
[ Laughs ]
What do you mean she sold it?
That back-stabbing old bird. She promised that if she ever decided to let that painting go, she’d allow me to broker the sale. Donald, we need that painting.
Dale, hear me out. I’ll double your highest fee.
Right. You know what, never mind. It would’ve been impossible.
No, I get it. I’ll go.
“Galilee.”
Uh, forget I asked. It was a mistake. You’re on to other things.
24 hours.
[ On phone ] Christoforo. [ CHUCKLES ] Hello, old friend! Yes, a party [ LAUGHING ] Yes, yes. Why would I not invite you?
No, no no. Where are you? Yes, a party. Yes, yes! 
No, no no! No, no, bring Basillo and his wife. No, no no. Yes, and the sister, too. 
Yes. Grazie mille.
You look nice.
I only brought one suit. I had to borrow something from Paolo.
His wife says it’s Tuscan Sunset.
Where’s Ressler?
Ah, yes, the tracker. About that.
To gain his trust. I told Blaise he had a mole. The tracking device confirms it.
No, she’s a con artist and a thief.
She won’t be killed. She’ll be banished. To rebuild, I need Blaise. And to get to him, I need his trust. Where the bloody hell is Ressler? 
And the bad news?
Of course he did.
Greyson! – Welcome.
Fake news, curse of our times. [ CHUCKLES ]
I have absolutely no idea. So many rooms, so many masterpieces. Let’s wander. I’m sure we’ll stumble upon it eventually.
I’d be a completely silent partner. Harold Lloyd hanging from the clock tower, risking all, saying nothing.
My goods run through your ports. If I’m caught, you disavow; If I’m not, you get 5% of the profits.
Yes. Of course, it looks even better if you’ve got a glass of champagne in your hand. Where is that young girl? Don’t move a muscle.
Analia, just in the nick of time.
As a matter of fact, I don’t. Truth be told, I’m broke.
It belongs to Analia here.
A-And the pianist, Paolo. They lent it to me under duress.
I don’t. You do. That’s why my men were taking it down. A gift to commemorate our new partnership.
Dale has spent two long years restoring it. And now it’s yours.
You could, and you will. Wrap it up and load it into his vehicle.
Go. Enjoy. We’ll talk tomorrow, set things in motion.
Almost.
Inspector Scutari? Yes, hello. I’m calling about the stolen painting. Si­, the Rembrandt.
I told you. The reason we’re here is to rebuild my empire.
That is a lily I may have gilded, but it’s a lovely evening on Lake Como. Let’s not spoil it picking the sense from the nonsense.
Blaise’s mansion is about 15 minutes from here, and inside it is the cornerstone on which I can begin to rebuild.
Yes.
Cool?
What are you doing? Why aren’t you destroying everything?
They haven’t notified you? We’re on the brink of a Level 4 breach!
My name? Caden Gard, Chief International Council for your employer.
I don’t have time for this.  I-I’m only here because Blaise has been arrested less than 20 minutes ago, and within another 20, this place is going to be crawling with Carabinieri.
That Blaise was arrested. What do you think I’m standing here for? Miss Chloe and I are only here because this is a Single Scope SCI sweep.
Oh, my God. Where is Peniford?
All right. Radio your team – Everyone! Tell them I’m on site and we’re at Tier 3, okay? Miss Chloe, contact our man in Interpol. Find out how much time we have. If anyone shows up, the alert word is “pumpkin.” You, inside.
Cellphones, pagers, anything with a chip needs to go in the microwave right now!
You. Can you access the security feeds?
Get there and destroy them. Okay people, listen up –  Sugarfoot has been arrested, and time is of the essence. We’re Tier 3, but this is what we prepared for. You all know the protocol. This is now officially a Single Scope Operation. You and you, I need you to find anything with a hard drive, get it in the bathtub. You two, you’re on paperwork. Anything with numbers gets burned. Somebody show Miss Chloe the financials. And you, show me Yankee Bob White.
The safe! Where’s the safe? 
Oh, my God. He’s keeping financials on the entire staff. This could implicate all of us. Take it downstairs and burn it. You, get me the combination to that safe.
Blaise’s passports – Find them, shred them.
Miss Chloe, time?
The passports! Go, now!
Get it out of here, anywhere. H-Have them put it in my car.
Take it.
Take it.
Do you have the thumb drive?
[ Earnestly ] Listen to me. Good God, man, listen. If you make it out, there’s a small hotel in Paris – 3241 Rue de la Mare. Say it back.
Go there. Get a room under the name Mr. DeLacey. Say it!
Right. I’ll make contact when it’s safe. Until then, talk to no one. Do you understand? Good luck, mate, and Godspeed!
Yes. That was a nice surprise.
Harold, you’re obviously upset.
My mistake. I thought you might be upset.
To be fair, stealing back a painting. Or trying, at least.
Right. Please don’t forget to pay the catering bill. Those folks were very, very nice.
True, the Italians will get credit for arresting Blaise with “The Sea of Galilee.” Of course, it’s not “The Sea of Galilee,” which they will undoubtedly realize shortly, at which point they will be forced to release Blaise with apologies.
Wrong. You get him, Harold. You and this Task Force.
Because while the Carabinieri have bogus evidence, you have the genuine article. Fast, hard proof of Blaise’s criminal activities all over the globe. Art heists, missing masterpieces. That necklace alone should be enough to put him away and get your new Director off your back for a long weekend, at least.
Penny for your thoughts.
Why’d you let me? It wasn’t the wine.
Because you’re my daughter?
Albert? Albert, look at me. Do you know who I am?
You’re a tough son of a bitch. Your loyalty to Kate is admirable. But you will die, Albert here and now, if you don’t tell me where that suitcase is. Who has it? I won’t ask you again.
Elizabeth, good evening.
Tom didn’t tell you? I was invited to dinner.
Thank you, Tom. I regret I can’t stay. I have another engagement. Sorry to have inconvenienced you, but at least you’ll have plenty of leftovers. Before I go, let’s have a toast.
Tom’s return, of course! Your family must be very happy to have you back. I remember warning you not to embark on that silly adventure. But nothing ventured, nothing gained. Welcome home.
Yeah. Uh, tonight? Maybe.
Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no! Gary’s – Gary. I’m just distracted. I locked myself out of my room. I certainly don’t want to go down to the lobby. I was hoping I might use your phone.
Piper, I have no idea what that means.
[ On Piper’s phone ] Dariush! It’s Bruno. I’m sorry. I- I somehow locked myself out of my room.
I was hoping– Oh right. No. Oh, no, that’s fine. That would be gre– Wait. [ Chuckling ] I found it now! Never mind. I- Yeah, right here, in my pocket of all places. [ Chuckles ] Okay. I’m sorry. Thank you.
Don’t forget the pickle-bites.
Dembe. Yeah. Did you get a plate number? Okay.
Sadly, my time at the Terrace Vista has run out.
Yes. While you go on a hunt for some dirty cops.
I believe the unfortunate incident with Officer McGinnis was far more than the stuff of headlines. I believe it was premeditated murder.
I still have a few friends among the men in blue. They’re whispering that the scene was staged by a well-compensated mercenary.
The perfect alibi – an officer well-respected by his peers, paid by your government to carry a weapon to protect and serve the citizenry. But I’m telling you, Officer McGinnis is a killer, and he’s not the only one.
Whoever it is, this isn’t the first police shooting they’re responsible for – and unless you find them, it won’t be the last.
Word to the not-so-wise–
When you come for someone, don’t show up in a rental car under your own name with a local address.
Well, he won’t get them if I’m dead. By the by, what’s with the boots? You guys do a lot of riding?
How many has Rivera sent for me?
Tell him that won’t be necessary. He’ll have his guns within 36 hours.
Or money to buy them.
No, Dembe – that periodontist from Tarkio? She was impossible. This is simply improbable.
I think this is the first time you’ve made it a priority to see me, and I appreciate that. Thank you, Glen.
Your heart?
It’s been – unpredictable.
A million dollars.
Of which you don’t spend a cent. You live with your mother, and I’m confident you’ve amassed quite a nice nest egg from all your various extracurricular activities.
I need a million cash. Not to keep, to borrow. For two days. Glen, please, this is important.
Smokey. Please.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen, you two need to find a covert runway. I don’t care if you have to build it yourselves, just find it and try not to kill each other in the process.
Tom. Right on cue.
Yes. About a certain business venture I’m pursuing. I think you’d fit right in.
Yes. And to think I’ve always had such good fortune with older women.
Levi Edwards. My munitions man. He’ll be inspecting the merchandise.
I believe I said walrus. I don’t remember, I was drunk at the time.
The money won’t be a problem.
Adika, I didn’t come here to waste my time or watch you eat. You’ve been trying to get me to kiss you into the business for years, I’m here at your table to do just that, so put down the fork–
I said it won’t be a problem.
On the contrary, I’ve never felt better. Now put away the gun before you do something you’ll regret.
A million reasons for you to have faith in my financial fortitude. We’ll need the merchandise delivered by the end of day.
Forgive the overt mistrust, but I’m not going to hand you a penny until Mr.
Then take Edwards. If there’s a bump in the road, do with him as you wish. Now get your merchandise in order. I’ll call you with a rendezvous site shortly.
I’ll take your word for it.
Smokey, Buhari’s plane is supposed to land here in four hours. If I were throwing a picnic, it’d be lovely, but there are trees.
Shovels and chainsaws.
Smokey, if this doesn’t work–
[ Hanging up ] Who the hell are Leroy and Quackers? 
[ Chuckles ] My land! They don’t make men like that anymore, do they?
Smokey, you were born a century too late. You’re a miracle worker. Heddie, I can’t thank you enough for keeping us on budget.
[ Chuckles ] Well, there you are.
This ought to be interesting.
Adika! How was your flight in?
Well, I picked the site for its magnificent views. Levi, you look well.
Adika, I appreciate the good faith. And if your merchandise is as good as I hear, there’s no end to what you and I could–
Shh.
You hear that? There it is again.
A piping plover. Their breeding grounds are along coastal beaches and alkali marshes, so to hear that bell-like call from a shorebird this far inland – my gosh, poor little fella must be lost.
Not if you’re a lonely little plover.
Dembe, if you could please grab Mr. Buhari’s payment. Levi, you look fit. You can help me load the merchandise.
Adika, what the hell have you done?
Women.
And here I was thinking she had finally made peace with me.
You’re certainly living proof of that.
Do you now?
If you’re gonna leave me locked up with someone, perhaps it could be a redhead with a nice smile and a friendly demeanor.
I use Epsom salt baths.
Not just guns. [ Indicates the parked plane ] A man needs to travel, and when traveling, I like to stretch out a little.
Tom, if I wanted to get rid of you, I’d put the bullet in your head myself. However, you are important to Elizabeth, so, like it or not, you’re important to me.
There’s a piping plover out here somewhere. Have either of you heard it? 
Yes! I can’t wait to get airborne. This is the longest I’ve been grounded in some time. But not to worry, Harold, it’s a two-for-one special this week – You not only get Miss Rebecca Thrall, you also get that despicable African gunrunner your agency has been hunting for years. I need you to arrange for him to be taken into FBI custody directly from my people.
I make friends easily.
Not this time. We mustn’t look a gift horse in the mouth.
 You know, Donald, before I turned myself in to the FBI, I held people like you in extremely low regard.
But I’ve found your determination to do the right thing, your genuine commitment to the thin blue line that separates order and innocence from the likes of me to be quite admirable.
I want you to know you can count on me if you ever find yourself in as difficult position as Officer McGinnis has put himself in.
Nevertheless, my offer stands.
For the day I hope will never come.
No fuel and no pilot, but a plane of our own.
Glen, you came for your money, which has been returned in full and while I’m deeply grateful for what you’ve done, you’re perfectly welcome to go.
It’s a three-day rental Dembe found through some online site. Something b-n-b? Are you familiar with such a thing?
They match hosts who want to rent out their homes with guests who want to rent them and get a commission from each one. It’s a license to print money. The renters never have to meet the owners. The Robinsons simply put my key in a lockbox outside. Completely anonymous.
“Peel.” Ah! Great ideas are like great athletes – efficient, elegant, powerful. I’m aroused by both and mourn the death of either.
Fitzpleasure was the greatest European racehorse in a generation. His stud price was set at 150,000 euros, but he only covered a single mare before the fire. One. Which is why I know he was murdered.
In horse breeding, genes are everything, and Fitzpleasure had the best ones. His owners stood to make millions spreading his seed. Now he’s dead, and another owner is conveniently positioned to reap the windfall. The owner of Fitzpleasure’s only offspring.
What? No. “Pot,” “mustard,” “satchel” – What’s that? Q-I? Qi?
[ Laughing ] Oh, come on!
Honestly. You’re like one of those extraordinary children who knows how to spell “onomatopoeia.”
The last white rhino, the final dodo bird – the only surviving member of a group or species is called an endling. You’re not looking for a horse killer, Elizabeth, you’re in search of the endling himself – the nom de plume of the legendary creator of one-of-a-kind items.
Hello, there.
Pity. I was just starting to feel at home.
I need a name. The person who hired you.
Proverbs 21, verse 10 – Solomon’s dissertation on the wicked and the company they keep. Do you know it?
Stirs up more passion than any other verse we study in Talmud class. “There is no honor among thieves.” I disagree. A few thieves have been among the most honorable men I have ever known. What about you – Sven – are you an honorable man?
Let’s put that to the test, shall we?
I need a name.
I do like a nice, long soak, don’t you?
The Mailman. Where can we find him? 
My apologies. That last one on the right [ referring to the “WANTED” poster ], I’ve see him somewhere.
Have you? And where was that?
[ Chuckles ] 
I received two unexpected packages at my residence last night.
I’m afraid they’re rather large.
They said The Mailman sent them. Imagine my surprise when I realized they meant an actual mailman.
Let me refresh your memory – they’re the men you sent to kill me.
You don’t know who I am?
But you sent them to my house. Why?
I think you know exactly what I’m talking about.
[ Sighs, leans over to unlock the hood ]
When I was 17 and heading off to the Naval Academy, I sent the most extravagant love letter to Sarah Ellen Winstead. She never replied. To this day, I remain convinced that the post office failed to deliver it, and that if your colleagues had simply done their jobs, the entire arc of my life might have been different. I might have been thinner and living in Maine.
I’ll add it to the list.
Drive.
I have enemies. People who want to kill me. Why is not your concern. What matters is that, when it comes to my security, I take extraordinary precautions. Tigger and Pooh violated those precautions at your direction. I assumed it was to kill me. If it wasn’t, I need you to tell me why they did it.
How extensive is the list?
But it could cover more.
The hold lists. Does every post office in the country have them?
And the robbers?
[ Chuckling ] What a marvelous idea. Really marvelous. I mean, except, of course, when the owners rent out their homes while they’re away, but that’s a small burl in the wood we can sand down.
Excuse me.
What else do you know?
I’ve seen him before.
No, but I know who might. Let me grab my hat. This should be fun.
Good afternoon, young lady. I’m here to pick up my labradoodle.
Her name is Edwina. She was dropped off by my dog walker, Hiram Toomey.
Thank you.
The private clinic of Dr Melissa Lomay, general surgeon and owner and proprietor of Doctors Without Morals, the first choice in healthcare for the career criminal. Mm, such nimble fingers. Brings back memories.
Tight as a drum, thanks to you. We were camping in the altogether under the most delightful autumn moon in the Forest of Dean* when a wild pig [ Laughing ] came out of nowhere and gored my left flank, so to speak. And Melissa here not only slew the beast and salved my wound with a honey of–
–yarrow compress, but also made the most scrumptious pork pie in the monarchy.
One of your employees – Dr. Felix Dresner, if I’m remembering correctly.
[ Hushed voice ] Melissa, while I appreciate your desire to protect the good doctor, he is a liability. Miss Rutherford isn’t the only one looking for him. The police are, as well. Help me find him before they do and I’ll cauterize the wound so nothing bleeds back to you.
The less you know, the better. We simply need a location.
I know someone who can.
Is there a force in the universe more powerful than a mother’s love for her child? The miracles of modern medicine pale in comparison. Can be life-saving. But not here. Not now. The next people who come storming in here will be throwing you all in paddy wagons. The best chance your son has is if we leave. Now.
Dr. Dresner can stay to care for the others.
I know.–
I’m asking the impossible for you to trust a complete stranger with the well-being of your son. But if you stay here, the authorities will take him and he will die. Please. Trust me.
I need your services.
It wasn’t a request.
The heart is already here.
Agreed. I have no intention of killing her.
I had no veiled intent in giving you this case, just a sincere desire to stop a criminal I believed to be truly reprehensible.
That a sinner can also be a saint.
Given the same circumstances, I’d like to think I’d be as brave as her. I know I’d want to be.
I’m in your debt.
Name your price.
Anthony.  Welcome back.
It’s not.
It’s about me taking over your business.
Right now, you have 100% of a business that clears maybe $50,000, $100,000 a year – maybe. I’m offering you 10% of a business that will clear 100 times that.
The value of your information isn’t in what you are able to take out of these houses, it’s in who you’re able to put in them. Reliable safe houses are incredibly hard to find and always at a premium. Instead of robbing these homes, I propose we rent them to individuals who don’t want to be found. If you can secure hold lists in every state, we’ll have a network of reliable hideouts stretching all across the country. Can you get the lists?
Only the ones willing to pay through the nose.
Obscenely. In the meantime, what do you have available for tomorrow night? 
Do you have a count?
By next week, we should have eight.
While I appreciate your enthusiasm, we have cash but no business to run it through.
Elizabeth.
I’m sorry to hear that.
I suppose it’s possible Nik was killed by someone with a connection to me, but I have no idea who or what that connection might be.
l- I’ll do what I can to find you one. In the meantime, a riddle to keep you occupied.
Why did that terrorist take credit for a crime he didn’t commit?
Because Ilyas Surkov is dead.
Bring the dog, leave the poop.
Rosie Cavendish had a bulldog. Franklin, named after her great-uncle. Poor guy had eczema, dermatitis, seborrhea – one skin condition after the next. The dog, not the uncle.
Given the lesions on her inner folds, I’d say she has pyoderma. What are you doing to treat it? Topical ointments or pills?
I need to borrow some evidence, Lou.
The personal effects of a homicide victim that are currently in evidence control.
You are the clerk – in evidence control–
–the man responsible for checking in and out evidence?
The deceased’s name is Nik Korpal. You have 24 hours. That should give us enough time to get– [ points to dog ]
–to get Coco the spa day she so desperately deserves. [ To Coco: ] Yeah, you’re gonna have fun! [ LAUGHS ]
Look closely. What do you see?
Our liquidity crisis has been solved.
These are rescued dogs picked up at shelters, given a bath and a professional grooming, then given back to the shelters primped and proud and ready for adoption. They supplement their business with regular grooming. But it’s basically a labor of love – and a 501(c)3.
[ CHUCKLES ] Even the most ruthless IRS agent would hesitate before auditing the books of such a noble enterprise.
Well, most of their business is mobile. They have a fleet of vans that go from shelter to shelter in 10 different cities. It’s 100 vans, a dozen or more dogs a van, 25 bucks a dog. You do the math.
Fiona, you’re an artist.
Ah. And how much do I owe you?
Yes, of course. And how much for the store?
And the vans. All of them.
Bless you. Bless you.
At the right price, I’ve found everything is for sale. Think about your price while I let Coco find a blade of grass. Come on, sweetheart. That’s it. [ LAUGHING ] There we go.
Cheer up, Lou. I’m in your debt.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Giving me this evidence is vital and much appreciated.
But what Coco and I have been up to is a revelation.
She’s always welcome to come in for a grooming, free of charge.
Oh, and her ointments–
Ointments. Funny word. Twice a day, three times on her inner folds. Coco, the pleasure was all mine, sweetheart.
The suitcase key.
But who did Nik entrust it to, and why did he get killed for it?
And who might you be? 
Nothing on Osterman or his team?
Osterman? Nothing.
That’s what you don’t know. Focus on what you do.
Any point of intersection? Kevlar, Cyclone.
What else? Cyclone. If it’s not a person or place–
Good. A military hard target made of a composite material.
So many people find cemeteries to be a reminder of loss. I find them to be a fervent reminder to seize the day.
Nik Korpal saved my life, brought Agnes into this world.
I came to pay my respects. How are you holding up? 
That’s six hold list’s worth.
Can you handle that?
No, but they might.
Wonder what can of worms we’re opening now.
Uh! You’re in my line of sight.
I’m playing the carom.
That’s it. Dembe and I have scheduled a tournament. It’s been in the works for some time, but we couldn’t quite settle on a format. I finally unearthed the Peoria System with a double-par limit, and here we are. The tournament is this week. And I have every intention of winning.
Oh!
Maybe it’s my putter. Mitchell Dunning of Dupont Circle is about to be assassinated.
Dunning. He found me through an associate of mine and is looking to disappear. My problem is that I don’t have the resources to help him at present. Yours is that Mr Dunning believes the hit was contracted through The Travel Agency.
Not a travel agency, Elizabeth. The Travel Agency – a murder-for-hire ring that lived in the shadows for nearly 30 years. Their assassins carried out a variety of contract hits until they mysteriously closed their doors 12 years ago, dashing any hope that law enforcement might one day solve the rash of killings the Agency left in their wake.
Innocents and not-so-innocents have targets on their backs, beginning with Mitchell Dunning.
Mr. Kaplan gave you a suitcase. In it was a skeleton she never should have unearthed and whose identity must remain secret.
I understand the temptation acting on a fine woman’s dying wish.
But your quest has cost Nik Korpal his life, and persisting will put whomever you involve in harm’s way.
You asked Nik to identify the bones, and he was killed for his trouble by someone who knows their identity and, therefore, their value. That killer is likely searching for a way to contact me since, knowing their value, he knows they are most valuable to me. I will allow myself to be found, recover the suitcase, eliminate the man for his troubles, and rebury the body in a place where it will be lost to the sands of time, as originally intended.
What’s in the envelope?
The name and address of the miscreant you’re looking for.
[ LAUGHS ] I understand you’ve placed Donald in charge of the task force.
Yes. You’re going to need backup.
Sounds like a delightful way to spend an afternoon. We can play “Celebrity” on the way.
I must warn you – I know all the absurdists. I kill with Camus.
[ CHUCKLING ] He is to me.
We couldn’t resist.
Fentanyl is like snake venom. 100 times more powerful than morphine. A lethal dose of heroin is about 30 milligrams? 3 milligrams of fentanyl is enough to kill an average-size male. [ LIGHTER CLICKS ] [ Red heats the mixture in a spoon ] In every conceivable way, I’d say you’re well below average.
[ TAPPING NEEDLE ] Anything to say? No? Nothing? Perhaps half a milligram will be enough to loosen your tongue.
That’s not a location. Maybe another milligram will jog your memory.
You just missed the ride of a lifetime.
Whoever you thought you were shooting at, if you tell us who they are, we can help you.
Perhaps you could be a tad more specific.
A criminal.
So you’re a witness he’s trying to get rid of.
Harold, your justice system protects those cops as it will protect you, no matter what you do to Zeke Wilson.
Yes. And if you choose to hold him responsible for what happened to Isaiah’s father or for all the people of color who are killed for saying the wrong thing or looking the wrong way, you can do that. You may be black, Harold, but you carry a badge, and like it or not, that means you’re a made man. Your justice system will protect you, just like it protected the cop who killed Isaiah’s father.
My observation is that you came to this party with an unregistered handgun.
Yes – if I were going in there. But I’m not. You’re taking it from here, Harold. And while your system won’t hold you to account for whatever you choose to do, your conscience will. Though, on the off chance that I’ve overestimated your tendency toward self-restraint, Dembe will be there to watch your back.
I feel like you’re a natural golfer, and I’m just not.
Like what? Like what? 
[ LAUGHING ] Well, that doesn’t count! 
You know what? Never mind.
Are you okay?
[ CHUCKLES ] [ Getting up ] Sorry. Tom and I have had our differences, but I believe he wants what’s best for you. And Agnes. Congratulations, Elizabeth.
Migrants hidden away in a Chinese freighter bound for South Carolina.
“Trafficking” implies the passengers are being moved against their will. These people paid for the privilege. All over the world, criminals are smuggling people into countries they can’t enter legally. Some are hoping for a better life. Others are escaping war or persecution for a price. People like me can help them.
I was. My organization provided access to the Americas, various European countries, select destinations in Asia. For a fair price, I provided a quality service. Mr Kaplan put an end to that. In her feverish desire to destroy me, Kate destroyed my relocation networks.
Because, as you can see, a ruthless and unscrupulous player has stepped forward to fill the void left by my absence. The ship these people were packed into like sardines was a death trap. It wasn’t fit to make the journey, which is why it sank two miles off the Carolina coast.
Elizabeth, whomever has filled the vacuum left by my downfall has to be stopped, or more innocent people will die.
There are much easier ways to earn a dollar than moving migrants. I did it because someone will, and if it’s going to be done, it should be done well by someone who holds to certain standards.
Fair enough.
Greece. The route north, through Macedonia. It’s the most traveled and the most lucrative. It’s a simple plan. We put someone in the pipeline. He gets the name of the person who took over my routes. We pull him out.
I do. Normally, I’d suggest we insert one of your people to get the name, but this time I suggest we use one of mine.
Yes, the Irishman Arthur Kilgannon. I’ve never met him. He lives in Sofia. That’s not a city I frequent.
Hello, old man. Is the sun past the yardarm? Perhaps I’ll have a drink, too.
Your reputation precedes you.
Yes, of which you’ve taken full advantage.
I have a proposition.
[ CHUCKLES ] It’s easy to move quickly when you don’t care about quality control.
My sources say otherwise. The way I hear it, travelers are dying all over the place. In six months, the business you took from me won’t exist. My proposition is a 50-50 split. Colin cedes operational control to me. Mortality rates plummet. Profits soar.
The reputation that precedes you is one of a man with exacting standards. I’m sorry to see that’s not the case.
Absolutely not.
You went in to get a name. You got it. Mission accomplished.
Which is why you mustn’t go.
I’ll fly you back to Thessaloniki, then head up to Berlin and wait for your arrival. If we lose contact, the Task Force will track you from the point of departure. And I can work backwards from the destination until we find you.
It won’t.
I’ll look after your family.
[ SCOFFS ]
What do you mean gone?
Well, they couldn’t have gotten very far.
Elizabeth, somebody in that warehouse knows where to find that truck.
I’m right here. Tell me what you know.
Then find the drivers.
The air stops circulating.
How long?
I have to go. Do what you can.
Where is Arthur?
I need to see your husband. Please, It’s important I speak to your husband.
Your– Uh, your son? If you could get your son on the phone.
Mrs. Kilgannon, someone I care about a great deal is in imminent danger, and I have very little time. The only person who can help me is your son. So unless you want this exchange to become considerably more heated you’ll get him on the phone immediately.
The seven trucks that received burn signals in Macedonia – I need the names and addresses of the drivers.
Allow me to pay you the courtesy of being blunt. I need your help to find those trucks, or I’m gonna have to put a bullet in your mother’s head.
You have five seconds.
I’m– I’m so sorry.
Your mother brought you into this world, Colin. Did you really think she couldn’t take you out?
I want the names of those drivers.
How convenient. Who’s he?
Mm. Thanks, Colin.
Driver’s not here. I’m too late.
He knows the police are after him.
You ever wonder why Dembe stays with me why anyone so decent would spend his days at the side of someone so indecent?
No, Elizabeth. Dembe didn’t stay with me because he saw me as his savior. He stayed with me because he saw me for the man I really was – a man surrounded by darkness. No friends who could be trusted, no faith that loyalty or love could ever truly exist. I was– Well, I was younger then. Angrier. Dembe connected his life with mine to show me, that day and every day, that the world is not what I fear it to be. He is the light in the darkness. Living proof that there is another way, that life can be good, that people can be kind, that a man like me might one day dream of becoming a man like him. He pledged his life, offered it up as evidence that I was wrong about this world. Dembe guards my life because he’s determined to save my soul.
The truck. Where is it? 
The resilience of the young.
I thought I’d lost you.
The world can be such an unsparingly savage place. One could be forgiven for believing that evil will triumph in the end.
If you’d died today, like that, it would be all the proof I needed that you are the one who is wrong.
[ CHUCKLES ] And here you are.
Harold! I’m here with Dembe.
Oh, we have some good news. It seems the young Ana Elazar will live to see a brighter day.
Bleak business, Harold.
Donald!
Well, I’ve found a little bribery goes a long way.
How many?
Tom and the others?
But what?
We’re 20 minutes away. I want an update in 10.
Too many people know about this situation already. This needs to end now.
Yes?
Any problems?
Where are you now?
I can be there in half-an-hour.
I just spoke to you 20 minutes ago.
On Nik Korpal’s death.
Elizabeth, I’m doing what I can. I’m sure Harold is, as well.
Tom is capable of getting himself both into and out of trouble. If he’s in harm’s way, I am quite certain he’s put in motion an escape plan, about which the people holding him are completely unaware.
It appears so. I’m sorry. I know that’s not the answer you want to hear.
 Get in! Tom!
Ah, hell.
I warned you about this damn suitcase. Now look at you.
They’ll be here soon.
I was hoping you could tell us.
And Lena?
We have to move. I warned you and your friends.
You need to keep that compressed.
Away from the road. West. Can you walk?
Please spare me your regret.
We need water, first aid.
Come on.
[ Tapping suitcase ] This is a secret, not a lie.
You couldn’t leave well enough alone. Not then, not now.
I hired you to protect her.
We go in, get fixed up, and get out. They can’t be far behind.
Your curiosity is understandable. A mysterious suitcase bequeathed to you by a dying woman who insists that Elizabeth must be apprised of its contents. But what if instead of happiness or closure, giving it to her has the opposite effect?
How can you be so sure?
You’ve always seen my relationship with Elizabeth as a zero-sum game. You think what’s good for me is bad for her and what’s good for her is bad for me.
Like you?
You’ll need clothes.
 It would’ve been so much easier if the bullet had hit you just another foot to the northeast. [ Taps Tom’s head ] 
We stayed too long.
Put it back.
No, I can’t. I hired you to do a job. The rules were explicit and you violated them.
You’re unreliable.
That’s no excuse.
Shh. [ Red ducks ] If we’re not surrounded, we will be soon.
I was in the Andes when I heard you and Elizabeth were engaged. Agents in the Columbian government had solicited my help negotiating the release of soldiers being held by FARC rebels. At the time, I was a rare intermediary having brokered sales of arms and equipment to both sides of the conflict. I was unable to return until the day of your wedding. Seeing her that day–
She was incandescent. I’d come out of the mountains, blinded by rage, flown 2300 miles, absolutely certain that you must die. And then – I saw Elizabeth. I’m a violent man, a terrible, powerful, violent man. But the way she looked at you, the way she loves you – I’m powerless against that.
I’ll say this for you, you’ve always believed that you were acting in her best interest. Selling me out to Berlin, faking her death – you always thought you were helping her.
You make her happy.
What? You’re always telling me to make peace. I made peace.
Aram, have you spoken to Elizabeth?
I believe Tom Keen is once again entangled in some nasty business, and I worry he may be involving Elizabeth.
What do you mean, “missing”?
Have you tried to reach her?
Do you have any other way of contacting her?
Tom. [ Clicks phone shut ] He’s at Union Station.
This is a horrible mistake. Whatever you’re doing, whatever it is you think you’re going to tell Elizabeth, this is a mistake. Walk away from this, Tom.
And why is that?
He’s in trouble, he’s desperate. But he won’t leave without Elizabeth and Agnes.
No, I haven’t.
I don’t know. I don’t know.
How far until the damn house? 
Call Harold. Tell him we’re going to the hospital.
Call him.
How long?
  … I thank whatever gods may be
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Elizabeth. [ SIGHS ] [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] [ He kisses her hand, holds it tightly to his cheek ]
Agnes will be so excited.
What? Oh, yes. Of course.
Elizabeth. It’s been nearly a year. Ten months.
[ After a long pause ] Tom is dead.
Of course.
Doesn’t work without you.
I think we’ve done enough.
I promise.
Okay.
What about Agnes?
You’ve entrusted Agnes to Scottie Hargrave?
Who ordered a hit on your wedding.
Okay, I will. I want you to promise me something.
That you’ll grieve.
I think you’re running away from your problems when you should be facing them. I’m sure it feels like you’re staring into an abyss, but until you mourn, you won’t be able to cross it.
Some.
That’s what I’m afraid of.
Don’t just go off and hide in the dark. Wherever you go, look for some light.
You look strong.
What for?
It was what you wanted.
Why?
Oh.
What happened?
You will. One of these nights you will. It’s just a matter of when.
Yes. [ Pause ] Will you be able to forgive yourself?
Paris, I’d like you to meet Elizabeth. Paris and I first met when he was a saucier at La Bernadin.
You may want to think twice. He’s making a turbot with a matsutake mushroom broth.
I wish I knew more. All I know for certain is that the men who died in your home were members of the Nash drug syndicate. I believe they were hired to go after Tom. I’ve pursued other members of the organization for more than a year, and they’ve proven to be completely ignorant of the incident or whoever hired them is powerful enough to keep them quiet.
What do you know about the nerve-gas attack in Toronto?
On Monday, the US Treasury will most likely attempt to freeze the bank accounts which financed the attack.
12 hours ago, a man known as The Informant accessed a list of those accounts on the classified computers used by the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Quick work, Harold. Celebratory drink? Paris makes a rye and absinthe cocktail that could blind an elephant.
Ohh. That’s delicious. Wealth is such a privilege. I’ve learned to love it [ chuckles ] Well, it’s not emotional, like hearing Maria Schneider’s “The Thompson Fields” for the first time or watching the sun set over the caldera in Santorini. But for pure, meaningless joy, nothing compares.
Do you know if he’s sold the list yet?
Elizabeth is back.
Determined to find Tom’s killers.
I’m the devil on one shoulder, and you’re the angel on her other. She’s in troubled waters, Harold. Please help her to navigate them.
Herman!
Oh, my God! [ Hugs him ] I’ve missed your tightly wound officiousness all clenched and pink and puckered. Perhaps this will loosen your stool. [ Hands him a piece of paper ] It’s true I had a setback. But I’m flush now, and my assets are seeking shelter from the storm.
Mid-nines. I haven’t read the fine print, but I do believe that meets your minimums.
Throttle back, Herman. You’re the fourth bank I’ve met today. I’ll tell you the same thing I told them.
Account numbers. I need the names behind the numbers.
This is an opportunity. The US government is about to freeze those funds. If I can ID the account holders and notify them before the freeze goes into effect, I’ll be owed a favor by individuals who will be in desperate need of safe haven for the very funds I’ll have secured for them. If you can help me identify those account holders, I’d be only too happy to refer them to you. You must have some means of identifying such promising new clientele.
 And who might you be?
Ooh, a fox in the hen house, Herman. You’ll have to keep a close watch on the chickens.
Name your price.
What do you want?
Hmm. A woman after my own heart. You’re an anarchist. Did you know Charlie Chaplin was an anarchist? I’ve cultivated a healthy hatred for governments and rules and all the incumbent fetters. I understand. Oh well, Herman. We tried. Perhaps next time. Wait a minute. What about Sogi-san?
I helped him secure a very rare dye several years ago.
A reclusive but visionary artist, which is all the more impressive considering he does his best work after drinking himself half-blind. Otaru, Hokkaido Prefecture. You get me those names, I’ll get you an appointment within the week. And if I’m lying, you could always hack into the bank and steal the whole omakase. I’m sure Sogi-san will do wonders with that whisper of unmarked flesh below your suprasternal notch.
Perhaps Tweety Bird or Yosemite Sam. Or a lady riding a monkey wrench.
Hello, Donald. I think it’s time for us to have a little chat.
I made it my business to know.
Why, so you can kill him?
The Informant is a client of Prescott’s. You’re Prescott’s fixer. I put you on to The Informant so Prescott would ask you to get off.
As a test. See how far down the rabbit hole you’d fallen. Good news is, you passed. Prescott asked you to look the other way, and you didn’t.
I thought we’d pay Bishop’s make-believe girlfriend a visit.
As long as you play dirty cop, we’ll be fine. Under the circumstances, I think you can manage that, can’t you?
Judge Fisher, I’m Raymond Reddington. Let me begin by saying I’m a great fan. You incarcerated three of my fiercest competitors. It may come as a surprise, but I appreciate a good law-and-order judge.
I know a man who gets people to talk in the most ingenious ways, utilizing the most unlikely tools for his trade – animals, insects, a well-placed cork. Unfortunately, times being what they are, my associate has taken a job working on an ostrich farm outside of Texarkana. But to get the truth out of a judge, I’m sure he’d come out of retirement.
Speaking of deals, here’s mine. I need to talk to Prescott, and given my relationship with Donald, he’s no longer taking my calls. Tell me how to find him, and I’ll arrange safe passage for you out of the country to the city of your choosing. Might I suggest Montevideo? No better way to forget one’s troubles than a night at the opera at the Teatro Solis. 
I’m almost always honest.
Forgiveness doesn’t mean accepting what you’ve done, Donald. It means understanding that the line dividing good and evil cuts through the hearts of all of us. ♤
You were preoccupied.
I told you to go home. You didn’t.
Nor should you. Your circumspection afforded me the opportunity to take care of Audrey’s killer myself. It was a win-win.
He goes to prison, so will you.
[ Sternly ] Donald.
My good friend Donald Ressler sends his regards.
I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, Donald, but we’ve been seeing an awful lot of each other.
I did.
With all due respect, I didn’t kill Henry Prescott to protect you. I killed him to protect myself. The man knew the nature of my relationship with the FBI, and I couldn’t risk that information coming to light in a public trial.
Sins should be buried like the dead. Not that they may be forgotten, but that we may remember them and find our way forward nonetheless. I hope this will help you do just that. Besides, after today, I’d have no reason to think you’d respond to threats, and blackmail is such a nasty business, particularly among friends, don’t you think?
I haven’t felt this giddy since Herbie Hunnicutt and I pooled our box tops and sent away for the decoder ring and periscope. Why is that? What is this feeling?
And you don’t? Of course, you do. Everyone loves hidden treasures – Yamashita’s Gold, the Oak Island Money Pit. Hell, even DB Cooper, which was more of a mystery and less of a treasure hunt, really.
Mystery? You know why?
Yes! Edgar Allan Poe. “The Gold Bug.” Oh, what a story. It has everything – a delirious search for treasure, the descent into madness, along with ciphers and bugs, a skull nailed to a tree. What a yarn! If he actually has the locations of the other coins, this could be a massive discovery.
I’m glad my misfortune amuses you.
The very rare 1943 Lincoln penny that I liberated from Grayson Blaise was stolen. The thief knew where to find me. He knew I had it. Now he has it. And I need a little help to get it back.
The man we’re looking for – this man is on a quest.
He has killed in service of it, and unless we stop him, he will kill again. Care to hear more? 
In recent years, Federal Reserve Notes issued in the 1930s have turned up in Manila and Singapore.
None, according to your government. It denies issuing any such notes and insists the few that have turned up are counterfeit.
It is because without the pennies, we will never find the notes or the man who’s killing to get them.
No, there are four. Bronze, minted in 1943.
Collectors value them because they believe they were minted in error – bronze one-offs when every other penny was made of copper. But what collectors don’t know, what makes them truly valuable, is not that they were a mistake, but that there is a code put there by the man who minted them – a map to a vast fortune.
Finding the long-lost notes is a quest for the financial holy grail. Hundreds of millions of dollars, redeemable upon request.
Aram, if you would.
After informing our Blacklister that I’d arranged to meet with him. That’s how he got the where and the when, and he used that intel to ambush me.
No, and if he gets it, he gets the code and the treasure, which means we need to locate that penny before he does.
Oh, don’t be such a spoilsport. This could be such fun! Where’s your sense of adventure?
Thank you, Aram. That’s the spirit. Harold, you could learn a thing or two from your subordinates.
[ On phone ] You don’t have the penny?
But it was there?
MPD was there before you?
A tip from whom?
The thief is your concern, Harold. Retrieving that penny is mine.
No, I wouldn’t think so, Harold. [ Hangs up. To Dembe: ] Let’s go to Elizabeth’s.
I’ve been looking for you.
[ Looking at the ad hoc evidence board in Liz’s living room ] Apparently, I’m not the only one.
I’ve cautioned you that in your pursuit of Tom’s killer, you need to restrain your darker impulses.
The help I need violates the spirit of that advice. I wouldn’t even ask for it if it wasn’t critical.
You haven’t even heard the question.
As a result of an anonymous tip, the MPD has the penny. I could use your help to get it back.
Which Harold has shown no inclination to access on my behalf.
Tom’s evidence.
Do you have any?
Remind me again what it is that we think we’re doing here.
Packet sniffer? Ugh.
It is an absolute mystery to me how these gadgets work – the Dick Tracey phones, these blueteeth connections. Quite frankly, I miss the rotary phone. Except for that zero. Watching that zero crawl back. Oh, my God. It was painful.
We discussed this. Your interest is in Stern. My interest is in this treasure.
Harold, always a pleasure.
Yes, I believe he will.
No, but I hope to.
Okay. I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.
You seem quite capable of guaranteeing your own safety.
Fine. Sentiment. This is your inheritance. I wouldn’t dream of taking more than 50%.
Sentiment only goes so far.
Do we have a deal or not? 
Other than secreting away a fortune and hiding its whereabouts in the pennies he minted, I know curiously little about your father. Usually the person who creates a legend becomes legendary. Why not him?
Then the Federal Reserve Notes went missing.
The same year he put the cipher on the coins.
A lowly maintenance worker, and yet, what he did is legendary.
If the pennies hold the secret to your inheritance, why didn’t your father give them to you?
– Whoops.
And you spent the past 40 years looking for it.
And yet, here you are.
Your father was a talented man.
“E pluribus unum” Out of many, one.
I’ve imagined robbing the Mint of the money they make, but never of a fortune they don’t even know they have. But this is a treasure hunt. And if that’s where “X” marks the spot– What do you know about the Denver Mint? 
What about the air-duct system?
We’d still have to contend with the surveillance.
What about the vault?
Which is made of steel and concrete.
Not just any cash. Random, untraceable – the kind you find in a money-laundering operation.
Hey. I need a tally of our current cash reserves.
Will it work?
We’ll need uniforms.
Eaz I eaz-a-gr-eaz-ee.
My associate thinks you might betray me. What do you think?
See, on the grave of his father.
Heddie, please, just get the cash.
We just drove straight from the Reserve Bank.
Run the badge. We’re on the list.
Please, can we move it along? We got another run up to Golden. I’d love to beat the traffic.
So much for your father’s grave.
Right as always, Heddie. Everything in place?
Let’s go to work.
Morning, boys.
I’m sure it’ll work.
It’ll work. Turn it up.
[ LAUGHS ] We’re in business.
[ On phone ] Hello, Harold. Excuse the rush. I’m on a clock. But I wanted to let you know, I discovered what our friend Abraham Stern is up to.
He’s robbing the Denver Mint.
That was my reaction. The gall! I told him he’d never get away with it, but he seemed quite determined.
There’s a hell of a racket here. Harold! Can you hear me?
He’s certainly convinced so. But the more I think about it, I’m not so sure there’s any treasure at all. I mean, treasure? [ CHUCKLING ] Really? Who knows. Either way, I’m afraid I can’t chat. I’ve got my hands full with a bit of a plumbing problem. Good luck with Stern. I have faith in you, Harold. You always get your man.
Morgan, how long?
We’re out of time. Shut it down.
Congratulations, Harold. You got your man.
And the pennies? 
Name your price, Harold.
Try me.
Abraham Stern’s father committed the crime of the 20th century. I just committed the crime of the 21st. Except it isn’t a crime. Hundreds of millions in Federal Reserve Notes payable on demand, which the Treasury says don’t exist.
And so the treasure myth lives on.
What about it?
I didn’t take anything else.
No, I did not.
You’re to be congratulated. I may be old, but I’m not an old fool, and you completely hoodwinked me and Harold. He thinks I stole a bloody rag from evidence.
You were the anonymous tip. You told the MPD that the penny was about to be stolen. You knew if they stopped the robbery in progress, they’d book the penny into evidence. And you didn’t call me to help me steal the penny or to distract you from your obsession with Tom’s killer. You called me to help me help you retrieve a rag covered in your blood evidence that might have convicted you of murdering Robert Navarro.
Where’s the body? Cooper says it’s a missing-persons case, but if they find that corpse–
I’d like to make sure of that.
Look at that.
Of course I’ll help you.
Ohh.
I’ve had my eye on a castle in Trieste. I’m flying over there in an hour to make a ridiculously large offer on it. Care to join me?
Oh, Bernard!
[ CHUCKLES ] [ LAUGHS ] I just can’t believe that’s it.
Hidden treasure, indeed.
Ah. [ Hands Bernard the penny ] As promised.
A bargain at twice the price.
[ Solemnly ] The Homburg he wore during The Blitz. Under its brim, he beat back Hitler with style and grace and unwavering confidence. I’m an eager, if unworthy, heir.
What do you think? Be brutal.
[ Laughs ] I’ll take amazing.
He can see us this afternoon. Did you bring it?
The truth?
My contact lives with his mother. She’s not particularly fond of me. I’m not quite sure if it’s actually me or what I represent. I believe she feels I’m a bad influence on her son. I thought a gesture of goodwill might smooth things over.
[ LAUGHS ] The mother’s family operates a pet café in Kyoto. You can enjoy the most savory tsukemen ramen in and around a variety of animals native to Japan – cormorants, katydids, the occasional tanuki.
Joro spiders. In Japanese folklore, the joro is said to be able to change its appearance to that of a beautiful woman who seduces men, binding them in her web before devouring them. Hence its name “joro-gumo,” or “whore spider.”
Here’s the mother’s work address and a note. If you could please drop them off?
I have a time-sensitive case for the Task Force. You did ask me to hold up my part of that deal in your absence.
Tom was a man of many truths. Which of those he was going to divulge, I can’t say.
My sincere apologies. I hope Paris has taken good care of you. [ To Paris: ] Tea, please.
And why is that?
[ LAUGHS ] What are the most expensive crimes in America?
Top three.
Arson. 500,000 arson fires occur each year, costing over $2 billion in property loss.
In those 500,000 fires, about 500 people die – one per thousand. Arsonists are many things, but rarely premeditating murderers.
Because they’re looking at the case the wrong way. This wasn’t arson that resulted in murder. This was a murder committed by arson.
A fact which makes The Cook both rare and dangerous and the next name on the Blacklist.
Why didn’t you deliver them?
You left them. Spiders.
No, he is not 16. [ KNOCKING AT GATE ] He’s 15.
Elizabeth, this is Tadashi. Is your mom home? Has she said anything about the gift I sent?
Who turned down Harvard a year ago, and a job at Face– whatever.
Look, I’m a technological moron. I just don’t get it, which is why I surround myself with people who do. Tadashi gets it!
I sometimes feel as if I should pay more attention to pop culture. Then I see this “Star Wars,” featuring this giant in a bear costume piloting an aircraft and a little green guy swordfighting. And I say a silent prayer of thanks for Tolstoy’s moral crisis.
This green fellow is considerably too short to be effective in a swordfight.
This is the world we live in now. I suppose we have to trust it.
What is this about?
For what?
I don’t know what that is.
And to me.
What is it transmitting?
Mrs Ito.
Did you get my gift?
Venomous members of the golden orb-weaver genus. For your sister’s pet cafe.
Out the back, the hole in the fence.
They’ll shoot you if you do.
Dembe.
Yes, and he could have the advantage.
Which is why we have to go. Because we don’t know.
I feel terrible, Mariko. I know it’s a small consolation, but I’ve made arrangements for you and Tadashi to stay in the hotel. A two-bedroom suite is yours until it’s safe for you to go back to your home. Room service, 24-hour spa, tickets to any of the shows in town. I hear there’s a revival of “The Music Man” that’s supposed to be marvelous.
[ To Tadashi ] She terrifies me.
What makes her happy? Does she like a good foot massage?
I do know, by the way.
What Tom figured out. The truth he uncovered has to do with me.
I told Tom not to pursue it.
An item Mr. Kaplan unearthed that I wish to keep hidden.
I can’t say.
Tom ignored my warning. That is why he died.
Yes.
We want the same thing.
But I am being honest. I do know, but I can’t say. I’m not trying to be clever. It’s not an ambiguity. It’s the truth. I have a secret, and I need to keep it even from you.
Samar, any news?
And Fagen?
Apparently the number four is bad luck in Japan. Who knew?
Ah, yes! Please, do come in. I ordered an avocado/cucumber scrub. [ To Mrs Ito ]  I guarantee you’ll feel like a new woman.
Or not.
I have no idea what you’re talking about.
We need to get this thing analyzed.
We don’t need the data. We need the person who built it. It’s sophisticated, custom-built by someone who does business with Damascus. I want a name and a–
Hello, Mr. Fagen.
You owe me your freedom. It doesn’t matter how I obtained it. What matters is that I did.
I expect two things in return. First, you won’t so much as light a match. Second, when you do, it’ll be at my instruction.
I’ll be in touch.
I know how hard this is.
You won’t miss a day more with her than is absolutely necessary. You have my word.
Which was?
I have to say, ­I would’ve done exactly the same when I was a kid. It’s a ghost story – creepy woods, rumors of corpses walking around in the dead of night.
What a dear. Yes. You’re a good girl.
All right, off you go. [ LAUGHS ] A few days ago, Tim Gorman, the owner of Ballistic-Nine, a controversial ­gun manufacturing company based in Reading, Pennsylvania, disappeared.
Murdered, I believe, by a provocative group known as The Invisible Hand.
The criminals here aren’t really criminals at all. That’s the point. The Invisible Hand chooses targets who aren’t actually aren’t committing crimes under existing law.
Yes, but morally reprehensible in the eyes of The Hand. “Eyes of The Hand.” What an odd turn of phrase.
Anthony Pagliaro?
The man works at a post office. What kind of emergency could we be talking about? Bring him in.
Emergency. Dembe said. In my experience, everyone has their own definition of an emergency.
That fits my definition.
I’m remembering now why I make the plans when we do business.
Imagine the confidence a man has to have in his own genitals to take on a nickname like “Big Willie.”
Does Momo know you’re the one who falsely accused him?
What did you need the money for?
[ CHUCKLES ] It does to me.
Come, let’s take a ride over and see this Large William and explain the misunderstanding.
Relax. In a matter like this, honesty is always the best policy. Probably.
There’s something a little “on the nose” about a drug operation in the back of a candy factory. I can’t get Sammy Davis Jr. out of my head. Big Willie! I appreciate you taking the time.
[ LAUGHS ] Certainly not me! Although I must admit, there has been a modicum of chain-pulling of late. I believe you know my associate, Anthony.
He is.
Oh, for God’s sake. Your package was stolen, Willie, but not by Momo Marinello. I’m afraid your first instinct was correct. Anthony took it in an extremely misguided effort to finance a personal procedure he’d rather not discuss except amongst friends. What matters is, now that you know the truth, you can call off whatever search you’re conducting. Anthony will pay you back in full with interest. No harm, no foul.
Oh, Willie. You certainly work fast.
You didn’t have to kill him.
Leadership is about more than the showing of strength, William. It’s also about knowing when to show restraint.
My associate here is the least of your concerns right now. Do you realize what you’ve done? Momo’s guys are going to have to retaliate.
William, you’ve started a drug war.
Great.
Oh, shoot. Anthony? Anthony!
Dembe!
You’re not gonna die. We’re gonna get you help right now.
Have a seat. [ Pause ] I’m not asking, William.
You’re here because I want some information. Truth be told, my desire to help Anthony with his little situation was not entirely altruistic. I have a project that would benefit from your experience selling narcotics.
The Nash Syndicate. I want to go after the Nash Syndicate.
I’m not a big fish, William. I’m Moby Dick.
Why not?
[ On phone ] What’s wrong?
Because you’re calling, and I don’t hear from you unless it’s urgent.
How?
What did she say? Be specific.
I can’t talk about this now.
We can talk about this later.
Hello, Bobby.
You know, I once knew a man who was shot 20 times in the torso and survived – 20 times. Achiko Takahashi.
You see, poor Achiko found himself at mortal odds with a particularly vengeful yakuza kumicho–
Oh, never mind. It’s not a great story. Except for the fact that young Achiko lived. God, apparently. He was absolutely certain it was God who saved him, which may be true, but science, believe it or not, was somewhat on his side. They say over 80% of targets on the body are not fatal. What about you, Bobby? After all those people you and your friends have killed, you think God smiled down on you today?
I want the one they call the Toymaker. I know he did work for The Invisible Hand.
Answer the question, Bobby.
Or I’m going to do to you what those 20 bullets couldn’t do to Achiko Takahashi.
I appreciate your optimism, Mr. Bandicott, but I fear we aren’t going to be friends.
You know who I am, Cleveland? [ Bandicott nods ] Good. That’s helpful, and only
Here, you take mine.
[ LAUGHS ] A VCR? Gosh, I’ve got a couple of boxes of VHS’s in a storage unit somewhere. My God, I haven’t seen them in years. A bunch of Laurel and Hardy’s, “The Conversation,” “Singin’ in the Rain.”
That’s not all you know, Cleveland. He had specifications.
And this man was familiar with the state of the art?
A cop? Thank you, Cleveland. You’ve been a terrific help.
Best I could do. They were fresh out of “Sorry I Shot You” balloons.
Careful now. Dr. Lomay says to expect some light bruising around the ribs, and don’t remove the compression garment.
I figured since you were going under the knife anyway, it would be a good opportunity to get it over with.
Give my regards to your new girlfriend.
Get some sleep, Tony. Big Willie won’t bother you again.
What?
Where did you get these?
Where are you on reinstatement?
50 minutes of pure reflection and self-evaluation.
God, yes. Therapy helped me become – an entirely different person.
Several years ago, one of my bankers in Liechtenstein shared with me some unpublished works by Carl Jung – handwritten notes on napkins, journals, and such. It was easily the most enlightening, consequential five days I’ve ever spent in a chalet.
Yes. Well. That was a cottage.
Agent Navabi, are you familiar with the Innocence Project?
The majority of the convictions they overturn are based on eyewitness testimony. People who swore they’d seen something they hadn’t.
Mr DeMarco was brought in for questioning in connection with the untimely demise of his business partner. As it occurred in the wake of a bitter falling-out between the two, the police identified Mr DeMarco as a prime suspect.
People think memory works like a video recorder. The mind records events and then, on cue, plays back an exact replica. In truth, memories are reconstructed more like putting together an ever-changing jigsaw puzzle than replaying a video.
Manipulated. Into providing a killer with an airtight alibi by a master in the art of misdirection.
A man appropriately known as “The Alibi.”
I assume it’s a pressing matter.
Yes.
He’s using doubles.
Some guess. Others know. May I?
[ CHUCKLES ] It’s been too long, Marty. You look wonderful.
I give, and I get the eyes and ears of an invisible army. Speaking of which, [ Shows photo ] Kahil Shula. Homeless, in considerable trouble. I need to find him. So please circulate the photo and the word.
Sounds absolutely delightful.
Marty. Any good news?
Delores. Hello. Thank you for agreeing to help.
That’s right. Kahil Shula. What can you tell me about him?
A fancy car?
Delores, do you like veal? My chef is preparing osso buco for dinner tomorrow night. Would you care to join me? I could have a car pick you up. Say, 6:30, quarter of 7:00?
What? Wait. I-I’m confused. I don’t– I have nothing to do with your reinstatement.
It can be transformative for people who need it. We don’t.
That won’t happen again.
Yes, I do. [ Reluctantly: ] Text Dembe the time and place.
Dr Fulton. I understand you’d like to talk.
Nothing personal.
Please.
I was told you wanted to talk about Elizabeth.
Remind me. Was “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” a psychological theory first pioneered by Piaget or Lucy in “Peanuts”?
Are we finished?
Would you honestly believe any answer I gave?
No. Elizabeth’s future with the Bureau depends on her giving it her best shot. And your willingness to judge her on her merits, not mine. Push her. Provoke her. Figure out a way past her grief and anger, and you’ll see her for who she really is.
Everything that I am not. Oop! Time’s up. I’m afraid that’s all for today. Good session, though. Tough stuff.
Mmm. Thank you, Paris.
Yes.
Every day. He’s also a hell of a chess player. Even better than Dembe and way better than me.
Delores, the man Kahil left with. Did you find his picture anywhere in the book?
The man Kahil left with, the one in the fancy car – I worry that he may hurt your friend. Please help me to protect Kahil.
I’m an honest man.
You should call Harold. Tell him we have an address for the Blacklister.
Agent Navabi, what a pleasure.
And that presents a problem?
Maybe you should keep looking.
I’m sure it’ll turn up somewhere, and when it does, let me know. Then we can celebrate. Your treat.
They’ll put it together. They have the face. And we have a long drive.
He’ll take the gun.
Please, and thank you.
You were about to leave.
Mr. Eckhart, go now, and you’ll live to die another day. Cover up. It’s mucky out there.
[ To Sinclair: ] I’ve been looking for you. Let’s go for a little drive. [ TAPS ON GLASS, signaling to Dembe ] 
A pacifist. How refreshing.
Mr Sinclair, I have no idea who Mr Hulton is or what he’s up to in Jakarta. My name is Raymond Reddington.
I know who you are. You’re obsessive-compulsive. You have a mind-numbingly patient and thoughtful attention to detail. I’ve admired your work for some time.
I’m a strange fellow. I’ve heard whispers of your work for years now – stories of your legerdemain, your ability to put a man in two places at once. The concept of bilocation is appealing even if not without consequence. I suspect you’re a fan of quantum theory. I’ve read quite a bit of Schrödinger myself.
[ LAUGHING ] Yes, of course. “The Double.” I love a good doppelgänger story. What about Ursula Le Guin?
And “Aiding and Abetting.”
It’s not important. What is important is that you and I may have much more in common than just reading.
Yes.
Oh, goodness, no. I brought you here to protect you. From the FBI. I have it on good authority that they’ve taken possession of your files. Without me, they’ll take possession of you.
Yes. If you do as I ask.
I cut a deal, Donald. You do it all the time.
The Alibi had 51 clients that we know of. Because of his handiwork, none were ever convicted of murder. With the evidence you obtained from his place of business, you can file charges against 27 clients who never went to trial. But thanks to your justice system’s quaint notion of double jeopardy, it’s too late for the 24 who were already tried and acquitted – even though you now have proof of their guilt.
Yes, who he murdered. Murders you can accuse all the clients of conspiring to commit.
Yes. In exchange for that list.
Not quite.  I want something from you.
To give me one of the doubles when you unearth him – Kahil Shula. I want to give him a proper burial.
Yeah.
We’ll stay as long as you like.
I took the liberty. Is this latex or memory foam?
Yes. Of jail. Because of me. And in exchange for said freedom, you owe me one genuine bona fide Earl Fagen electrical-wires-somehow-got-crossed inferno. Then you’re out.
Then take a snort. This isn’t a negotiation. It’s an assignment. I have a business that’s become a liability. I need you to burn it down.
[ Calls out ] Critter Cabin. We’re in the book.
There you are. I have a case.
For now. Because he’s afraid not to be. I find a good bedside chat to be effective and exhilarating.
And then what? If it turns out to be a cop, what are you gonna do then? Let the system close ranks around one of its own? Let him lawyer up? Stand trial? Juries acquit cops even when they have video showing those cops shooting innocent victims. You think a jury will take your word over his, your memory? The memory of someone who suffered such significant brain trauma she was in a coma for 10 months.
Because you and I both know this doesn’t end in a courtroom. It ends on the street. I want you to be prepared for that. About this case–
Well, unfortunately this is an urgent one. There’s been a rather acute viral outbreak in New York City, and I’m afraid it was not a natural occurrence.
Smokey, as you well know, Heddie did not take a powder. She’s lying in her bed right now, sneezing and wheezing, swollen up like a puffer fish. I’m afraid all the dogs and cats finally got the best of her.
I want you to go to our vet and find out how he disposes of the animals he puts down. We’re gonna need about half a dozen.
Skeletons. To make it look authentic. Couple of dogs. Cats. I think we shampoo the occasional marmot.
Earl, you have a gift. Others create, you destroy.
Mr. Hepworth. Thomas Dekker.
Let me ask you – How come you get to audit me and I don’t get to audit you?
Granted, you use my money for some worthy causes – roads, schools – but building a border wall, prosecuting people for smoking pot, building even more prisons to hold even more young men of color? Why should my money finance that?
Hershey. Hershey. Hershey. You’re missing the point.
The point, the essential point, is this – we’re all sinners.
That’s the point. Lust. Gluttony. Sloth. Three of my favorites. But you’re here because of my greed. Tell me, what’s your sin, Mr. Hepworth?
Of course you do. “For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God.”
[ Voice sonorous ] Testify, Brother Hershey.
Don’t think. Flow.
That’s it. Let it out. Let it out. [ Red pushes Hepworth’s head back ]
Amen, to that.
Don’t despair, Brother Hershey. Your job is what kept your son out, and now it will be what gets him in.
I’m going to do that. In exchange for services rendered by you. Or, to be more precise – not rendered by you.
Very sporting.
Yes. Very impressive. What a gymnasium – a real shrine to athleticism. I can just feel the testosterone.
The charming lady who just left?
[ CHUCKLES ] Well, then allow me to make it an even better one. Every great athletic facility requires spectacular locker rooms for all those inspirational pre-game sermons, the half time pep talks, all that post-game towel snapping and rump slapping. Let me be forthright. If you’re willing to offer enrollment at the academy to a very, very promising young man that I know, then I’d be willing to pay for those locker rooms.
His name is Charlie Hepworth. Now, I know there’s been some bad blood between you–
Yes, but to be fair, should poor Charlie really have to suffer the consequences of
Mm. There must be something I can do to change your mind.
Well, let’s see if I can.
As Old Man Quimby, my fencing instructor, used to say “If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, oh, what a Christmas we’d have.” My God I loved the foil.
Well, as it turns out you weren’t offering quite enough. [ CHUCKLES ] She accepted my proposal over the most delicious buckwheat blini and a tour of her surprisingly vast collection of ceramic salt-and-pepper shakers. But the funny thing is, I have absolutely no use for the place. If only there were something you could do to help me think of a constructive way to develop the property. Any good ideas?
Really?
Maybe a massage parlor. The athletes would love it!
“If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.” Ah, Quimby. The man was a walking aphorism.
Smokey, as it turns out, that won’t be necessary.
Who knew an IRS agent would be so amenable?
Brother Hershey, behold a miracle. [ CHUCKLES ]
Of course you can. That’s why I did it.
But it is in your power. You’re the auditor.
So am I, Brother Hershey. [ Red snatches back the jersey ] So am I.
It appears we’re going to need that chinchilla after all.
Earl, I’ve been thinking, who am I to stand between you and your calling? You can make disappear in one hour what it took 100 men a year to create.
There may have been a slight hiccup.
The audit begins tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.
Can you do it by then?
Is that a yes or a no? Or is a haiku sometimes just a haiku?
Well, then–
I do see the fire in your eyes. And it’s terrifying.
I couldn’t bring myself to burn it down. I like it here.
I don’t think so.
Smokey, shut your mouth and look and learn.
Why is that?
That is a bit of luck. [ LAUGHS ]
I assume that you assume the fire was the work of an arsonist.
Hah! How ironic.
Mr. Fagen.
I realize that I’ve stoked the flame, so to speak, which is why I brought you this. 
Zig Ziglar at his most persuasive. Are you familiar with his work?
Who motivated me to quit smoking and shoot from the neck down.
A retainer. For services not yet rendered. Read the book, think positive, control your urges, and I’ll put your gift to good use.
Will also be credible. Any questions about your memory will go away. So will Mr.
Not until I get what I want.
Garvey provides protection for the Nash Syndicate. I know some of the players. I’ll shake them loose while the Task Force questions the witness.
I’m going to help with the former and prevent the latter. 50-50 split. Like a good divorce. Harold.
My word is my bond. My currency. I gave Peter Caras my word that I’d move him before the Nash Syndicate learned that he’d cut a deal with the Feds. But that didn’t happen, did it, Mr Gabinelli? The Syndicate found him here. Killed him in this very room. At the time, you gave me your word that you had no idea how that happened.
Mr. Caras was a federal witness, so I didn’t give it a second thought when the Marshals sent Ian Garvey to investigate his murder. But now I know Garvey wasn’t here to investigate the murder, was he? He came to cover it up. You betrayed me to Garvey. So, now, as absolution, you’re going to betray Garvey to me.
And I am but a humble killer with a gun pointed at the withered prune that passes for your heart. The next time an associate of the Nash Syndicate shows up, I want a phone call, a room number, and a key.
Good. Turn the lights off on your way out.
You have someone?
A romantic! How counterintuitive.
It’s not so much appreciation as good planning.
[ To Gabinelli ] You’re gonna need a colostomy bag. You deserve worse.
But let’s talk about what you’re going to do which is name your price, and quickly, before policemen who actually uphold the law arrive to clean up this mess.
You have the bones. You already know the truth.
The whole truth is that we are all clinging to a lovely blue ball floating in a sea of blackness. Everything else, including and most especially, the truth you’re looking for, is “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” [ from MacBeth, of course ]
You could, but you haven’t. And you won’t. I’m not sure why. There’s something I’m missing. Something holding you back. I won’t kill you until I have the bones, and for some inexplicable reason, you won’t go public until you know this whole truth. We may have a stalemate, but with the FBI, you’re at a distinct disadvantage. They’re hunting for you. And as you’ve killed a cop, they will make it their life’s work to put you on death row. Unless you give me the bag, in which case, an accommodation may be possible.
That’s my offer.
And why would I do that?
[ On phone ] Of course I can get them.
Send me the list. You’ll have the records this afternoon.
[ CHUCKLES ] I’m sure you do, but I’m not going to tell you.
Did he?
And you have him in protective custody?
[ On phone ] I want all this to be behind you.
Dembe, is everything in place?
You never will. I’ve taken him away – from you and the FBI.
Yes. A thuggish order I immediately disregarded because I don’t take orders from you. The witness and his grandmother are safe and secure. And as long as I’m alive, he will not testify against you.
I don’t have to because, where she is concerned, you have no leverage. Secret or no secret, if you reach out to her, I’ll cut off your hands. If you look in her direction, I’ll cut out your eyes. And if you ever utter her name again in my presence, I’ll cut out your tongue.
Oh, I have plenty of questions, but none I’d pose to you. The answers will have to wait for me to find out on my own.
Mr. Garvey, might I suggest you enjoy what little time you have left – crab cakes, scalp massages, perhaps a double feature of “The 400 Blows” and “Jules and Jim” – whatever floats your boat. Do it now, because I will find those bones, and when I do, I’m gonna kill you.
Yes?
Of course.
What’s this about?
You have my word.
I’ve already told you.
I promise Ian Garvey will not get away from me.
[ On phone ] I detest waiting. Tell me something good, something worth waiting for.
When will I get it?
He won’t. Leave now. You can be here in 30 minutes.
But- Jerry? Jerry?
Nothing good.
I hope you have indigestion.
Excellent!
Medicinal South Sudanese cuisine.
Thanks to Dembe. His cousin was recently named foreign minister.
I’m not here hiding from American law enforcement. I could dodge those raindrops and never get wet. I’m here because of Garvey and you should be, too – for your protection, and to cure what ails you.
Did you bring the file?
I’m trying to.
Jerry Jawal wasn’t just a port manager. He was an important associate for the Nash Syndicate – the man responsible for bringing product into the country safely and with the proper documentation. He was killed yesterday while talking on the phone to me.
He worked with the Nash Syndicate, not for them. I’ve known Jerry for some time. We were in the process of making a deal. He’d agreed to bring me a ledger – a list of every Nash Syndicate shipment and its point of origin for the last 14 months.
There’s no mention of a ledger recovered at the scene.
To make a hate crime look like a robbery? Now I have indigestion. Tell me your theory. Who’s your hater? And what does he hate? 
Good afternoon.
“This”?
I’m looking for Coogan Hudnutt. You must know where he is. You’re the guys who provide security at his tiki-torch rallies. $10,000 [ Waves a wad of bills ] goes to the first man to speak up and tell me where to find him.
Oh, dear.
Aah! Looks like we have a winner. [ Plops bills on table ] Where’s Coogan?
Rumors are you’re the man who killed Jerry Jawal. You must have an item I’m looking for.
And here I was afraid you might make this easy on yourself.
What the hell are you gonna do with pastrami?
Oh, well, I mean, is he–
[ CHUCKLES ] I’ve missed you, Teddy. It’s good to have you back on the job. May we join you for lunch?
I have no idea. I would think it was an even number.
Elizabeth, I have news.
It appears we were both wrong. Our killer is neither Garvey nor a white supremacist.
You were half right about Jerry Jawal’s death. The ledger, the contents of the safe – the whole robbery scheme was clearly staged to cover the crime.
The young lady who fainted, was she taken to a hospital? 
Yes, please. And if you won’t tell him, do tell me.
A friend – or a foe. I’m fine with either one. Let’s just say, an interested party. My name is Raymond. The woman who killed your husband – am I right in assuming it was a woman, Reva?
I understand why you’ve been protecting her. She saved you. Freed you from the unimaginable nightmare of a forced marriage with a man three times your age. I need her name, Reva.
Your husband was a drug dealer. [ Adesh and Puja are shocked ] He worked with a particularly vicious organization, helping to smuggle their drugs at the port. And now you killed their man – a critical asset. What do you think they’ll do when they realize it was you this gang of killers notorious for showing no mercy to their enemies?
I don’t want to hurt her, Reva. But she has something I need. It means nothing to her and everything to me. Who is she?
You referred her to another client.
Elizabeth, hold on.
Well, now I’m confused.
You know that I did.
I betrayed no one, least of all you. I told you I was going to get that duffel bag. If Garvey is in your custody, that will be impossible. If Garvey goes on trial, that will be impossible. So, until I have that bag, I will do what I must to prevent that from happening. But I will get it, and then Garvey is going to die.
You know the answer to that.
I owe you an apology.
I suggested you take refuge here. You chose not to. So, yes, I was watching you in Boston.
I’m not apologizing for that. I’m apologizing for telling Garvey that I would kill him if he ever came after you.
Think like a criminal, Lizzy.
Yes.
I don’t expect you to accept my apology – not until this ends. And when it does – maybe.
I understand you have the young girl who killed Jerry Jawal in custody. I need you to ask her a question for me – for us.
Ha! Some kind of back scratcher, I think. [ GRUNTS ]
Your witness presented a legal threat. Unfortunately, Mr. Garvey isn’t afraid of legal threats.
No. But he is afraid of losing his power, which is exactly what I intend to take from him when we find this damn ledger.
[ Sips Scotch ] Ah.
You tried. You failed.
You’ve had your turn. Now it’s mine.
Mm-hmm. But now I’m not the only one who’s missing something of value.
I’ll be in touch. 
I have a lead on Garvey.
They put Rita Hayworth’s picture on the side of an atom bomb.
Talk about a femme fatale.
Righteous.
The port manager who was the go-between for the Nash Syndicate and their supplier in Afghanistan. Zarak Mosadek. You’ll see his name several times in there. He runs an international opium operation in the Helmand Province.
You didn’t have a lead, Elizabeth. You had an unreliable witness. A witness who says he saw what he saw–
From across an alley through a window. No jury would convict based on his testimony.
I told you Garvey isn’t afraid of legal threats. He’s afraid of losing power. The ledger tells us how to take it from him.
Garvey is a drug lord masquerading as a cop. If we get leverage over his supplier, we get leverage over him. Once we have that, you’ll have your revenge.
Must be nice.
Not having anything precious you want to keep to yourself.
Do you trust him?
Then I would trust him with mine.
Where’s Elizabeth? 
Bonjour.
Agent Navabi, quel plaisir.
Dembe and I were detoured. We’re in the Latin Quarter at the moment, having a quick visit with an old friend.
[ To Dembe: ] Mmm! Ah, the Reblochon. See if he has some quince paste or a handful of walnuts around here somewhere.
Uh, yes. About that–
 STAMMERING ] A small wrinkle. Nothing to fret.
Uh, truth be told, I anticipated a dear friend and contractor by the name of Bunyan Dufour would be handling Mosadek’s security in country. He’s a trusted operative who’s worked with Mosadek in the past.
Overbid the contract. Worse yet, it appears Victor Manzon is now running point on Mosadek’s security.
Unfortunately, Victor and I have something of a sordid past – [ CHUCKLING ] I’ll spare you the details, but the long and the short of it is that if Victor were inclined to hand over Mosadek’s security detail to anyone, it wouldn’t be me.
[ CHUCKLES ] Oh, I wouldn’t suggest we do anything.
Welcome back. How’s the noggin? You went down like a bag of rocks.
Save it, Victor. I’ve had too much to drink to care what you’re saying in any language. The only thing you and I are going to discuss is Zarak Mosadek and whatever rock you and your security firm are hiding him under. So, let’s get down to brass tacks before you and I and your noggin have another go with the bottle.
Thank you, Donald. Ever the gentleman.
I do. Zarak Mosadek and his entourage are currently staying in an eighth-floor penthouse on Avenue Kleber in the 16th arrondissement. Now, in addition to the two guards who are with him at all times, there will also be two men assigned to the room and a scout watching from an apartment across the street and two armed guards in the lobby of the building.
No. He has three vehicles parked on the street below and assets in the French police, and, oh, we mustn’t forget the usual building security and CCTV feeds.
Oh, come on. Where’s your sense of adventure? Your esprit de corps?
The elevator.
Oh, my God! You had the same idea!
Well, the first obstacle is access to the building. Fortunately, Dembe has a Sudanese contact who helps to find work for young immigrants in the city. Dembe’s contact will arrange for coded security badges, which gets us into the building, which brings us to Jean-Philippe.
A delightful little firecracker with whom I’ve become acquainted. He’s a proud Parisian, which can be frustrating at times. He understands English perfectly, but refuses to speak a lick. Perhaps you can brush up on your French, Agent Navabi. At any rate, Jean-Philippe will work ahead of us and run an intercept to the building’s security feeds, making it possible for us to throw them into darkness and steal their feeds at the flip of a switch. While that’s in the works, I need you to handle the exit strategy.
Mm. Vehicles. Ones that have been reconfigured to blend into the city. The Police Prefecture need to know nothing of this adventure. Rather, I thought Agent Navabi might have a contact in Mossad who could assist with such a request. I’m sure she’s owed a favor or two.
Right. Well, while rigging the CCTV network, Jean-Philippe will also set charges–
–that will detonate at the precise moment that Mosadek and his men are alone in the elevator, out of reach from the rest of their security team, thereby dropping the car down the shaft, then engaging the emergency brakes just as they arrive in the basement, where we’ll be waiting to dispatch the guards, grab Mosadek, and flee while the rest of the security team scrambles.
Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.
[ CHUCKLING ] Yes, but one thing at a time. Isn’t it funny how things work out? Five years later, and here you are with me in Paris, preparing to steal a wanted man off the elevator. It’s almost as if you didn’t try to kill me in Belgrade all those years ago.
[ LAUGHS ] Well, either way, if we pull this off, you’ll have something to tell the grandkids. With a nick-nack, paddy-whack, give a dog a bone, this old man came rolling home.
You and I share a problem. You’re here to help me solve it.
Did you?
I’m afraid there’s been a misunderstanding.
Ian Garvey.
Cutting his supply. Taking away his power. That’s my price.
[ CHUCKLES ] No. Because I didn’t take him.
To convince you to cut ties with Garvey. I was planning on forcing the issue. Now I can give to get. You do what I want, I’ll make sure you get your son back.
Ah, forgive me. I’m Raymond Reddington.
Are having a bit of a dustup, which I imagine has taken a toll on his various business interests, including yours. Our shared problem is Ian Garvey.
Maybe. But we’re going to do it for you. I get Garvey, you get Mateen. Are we agreed? [ LAUGHS ] Of course we are. You won’t leave here alive if we aren’t. So who took your son? 
Apparently, they believe Mosadek’s an informant for the US Military.
Because the relationship is only valuable to the Pentagon if it’s a secret. If your Sea Lions showed up in Paris to save the son, it wouldn’t be.
Boarding school.
Excellent. I’ll be at the Louvre. When you’re done dotting your I’s and crossing your t’s, you can find me gazing in erotic wonder at the beauty and power of the Winged Victory of Samothrace.
[ On phone ] What do you mean you lost him?
Either Mosadek lost your tail and has no intention of being found, or he was taken by the very same people who abducted his son.
What? What is it?
It was a ruse. They knew you’d be watching and needed a way to get Mosadek out.
The catacombs.
Dembe, Quartier De La Gare.
I’m hoping we can intercept them.
Pinky Schmidt – remember him?
Tried to convince me to come in on that plan to steal the medieval tapestry from that church here in Paris.
And the tapestry remains. Pinky’s always been a little flaky on the follow-through, but he did have an ingenious plan of how to get it out of the church without anyone knowing.
The same cemetery where Mosadek was abducted – the closest access point to the catacombs. We’re going to that church.
Excuse me. Excuse me. I am sorry, but we have an emergency. You don’t understand a word I’m saying. Uh, English? Yes, English it is! We have a bit of an emergency some kind of gas leak. Gas leak. Evacuate, please. Uh, and we need everyone to exit through the front. Now. Evacuate now.
Ah, gas leak. We need everyone out right away.
We’re not sure. We think from the furnace in the basement. The- the thing could blow–
Right. [ Loudly ] Uh, please, everyone, we need to clear the church immediately.
Whoever you are, you aren’t walking out of here.
[ Loudly, to those cowering in the church ] I’m truly sorry for all of this. I hope everyone is okay. You’ll be happy to know the issue of the gas leak is completely resolved. I’m sorry for the disruption.
[ To Mosadek ] The stones.
[ To the Docent ] My apologies. I hope this helps to cover the damages.
Au revoir.
You can express your gratitude by making good on our agreement.
[ LAUGHS ] I have a long and unhealthy list of wants, but when it comes to Garvey, I have but one. It has to do with a meeting I need you to arrange. A meeting that concerns your operation.
Which was?
You have the bones. You already know the truth.
If you ever utter her name again in my presence, I’ll cut out your tongue.
I promise Ian Garvey will not get away from me.
I trust he knows why and what he must do to regain your patronage?
Unhappiness motivates whimpering. Action is motivated by fear.
Then he’ll bring me what I need, and your debt will be paid.
[ CHUCKLES ] As the Russians say, “Trust but verify.” Having saved your son from those who suspect you work with American intelligence, I’m sure you wouldn’t want them to see photos proving that you do. [ Red shows him a folder of photos ] Goodness knows the next time they take your son, I may not be in Paris.
I’ll contact you with a time and place. When I get the bag, you get the photos and Garvey gets your good graces. Everybody wins.
Extraordinarily human. Nothing more. Nothing less.
After more than two decades on your Most Wanted List, I’ve become something of an FBI buff. I know all about your Wacos, your Ruby Ridges, COINTELPRO, going all the way back to John Dillinger, Al Capone, all those communists, the incorruptible G-Man, a colorless if admirably professional lot.
This apartment. Right here. Oh. My God. To have been the proverbial fly on Clyde Tolson’s duvet.
[ LAUGHS ]
This was their secret hideaway. Imagine the conversations. Cooing over JFK’s lovers. Slandering Dr. King. What peignoir to wear to bed. When I saw the apartment was for sale, I couldn’t resist.
Allegedly. I wouldn’t admit this in mixed company, but J. Edgar and I have a surprising amount in common. For instance, we both always get our man. He got Tolson. I got Garvey. Or I will, by this time tomorrow.
Mosadek has ordered Garvey to bring me the duffel bag. Garvey thinks he’s going to give it to me and walk away. I wanted you here to tell you I’ve made other arrangements.
To get our man and keep my privacy.
That is ridiculous.
I won’t tell you something that’s none of your business. It was none of Tom’s business. You may feel entitled to know what it is because he died trying to figure out what it was, but you’re not. A fact which I have patiently tried to get you to understand. Be hurt. Blame me. Howl at the moon for all I care. But this is my problem, not yours.
How convenient.
Yes! [ Referring to the game ] You gathering intel that indicates I shouldn’t go to a meeting you don’t want me to attend.
I have oxen.
Where’d you get your information?
Then, no, I’m not listening. [ Slaps phone shut ] [ Reading: ] “You have died of dysentery.” Damn it!
So do I. [ DIE CLATTERS ] But I’m still going.
Mr Sinclair. Raymond Reddington. I told you a day would come when I’d need you to perform your peculiar brand of magic. That day is arrived.
Yes.
 LAUGHS ] Perhaps! However, I’m afraid the meeting is unavoidable.
A trick that allows a man to be in two places at once – an illusion I believe will come in handy, given the circumstances.
You don’t have a year.
I don’t need an alibi. I simply need a double.
You have 16 hours.
I must say, Harold, I’m flattered by your concern, but I’ve spent a good part of my life in situations very much like that.
I’m sorry, Donald. I missed that. I was still basking in the glow of Harold’s concern for my well-being.
[ LAUGHING ] You’re the FBI. My God. What would J. Edgar think?
I have an idea. How about you say you were looking for the most-wanted man in America, and in a valiant, but fruitless, attempt to capture me, you stumbled upon him.
This is about justice for the man who murdered Agent Keen’s husband – a dangerous and dirty cop who not only runs the ground troops for an international drug syndicate, but who also has exploited his considerable resources within the U.S. Marshals Service.
Ian Garvey has been untouchable. I’m giving you a chance to do what the Bureau has been unable to do for over a year. And along with Garvey, if you’re lucky, you might even capture Zarak Mosadek, who somehow slipped through your fingers the last time.
That’s what he thinks he’s doing. In actuality, he’s delivering Ian Garvey to you on a silver platter. You just have to catch him in the act of killing me, not after he already has.
I feel confident.
God doesn’t want me, and the devil isn’t finished. The meeting is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. Do get a good night’s sleep. I’ll need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed at the ass-crack of dawn.
Well, that’s a start!
[ LAUGHS ] This reminds me of our high-school production of “Guys and Dolls.” A rousing rendition of “Fugue for Tinhorns.” Stubby Kaye has always been something of a role model.
Stubby Kaye? “40 Pounds of Trouble”? Sam the Shade in “Cat Ballou”? Ah. Doesn’t matter. Let’s hear about the plan.
Anthony!
We’re here. Garvey and Mosadek’s men will likely take up positions here and here. The feds will hang back. They’ll want altitude for clear sight lines here, here, and possibly here. Which means–
Chuck and Morgan can handle the vehicles. Whatever we need.
[ CHUCKLES ] Raleigh, are those new spectacles, or is that a twinkle in your eye?
[ LAUGHS ] That’s the spirit. Let’s have a little fun. But, please, do your very best to make sure Tony’s not killed in the process.
Were it not for all the trouble the contents of that bag have caused, you would’ve been dead long ago.
Let’s not forget Detective Singleton. It takes a special kind of man to kill his own colleague.
The bag.
Hello, Ian.
Welcome back. I hope you had a good rest. There’s much to discuss.
It feels good to be wanted, doesn’t it? 
The impossible. I put you in two places at the same time.
As a general rule, a magician never explains his tricks.
But this one is just too good to keep to myself. It started yesterday just after lunch.
While you were plotting with your minions from the Nash Syndicate, I was hatching a plan with my men to meet with you.
“With a butterfly kiss and a honeybee hug, sleep tight, little one, like a bug in a rug.” [ Trad. ]
Then came a plaster mold of your face, a willing double, a little makeup, a little make-believe, and, voilá!, two Garveys with one stone. While the real one slept, the imposter picked up your men just in time for them to see your Off-Broadway debut in all its theatrical glory.
They already do. The FBI believes you killed an Afghan government official. Mosadek’s colleagues believe you killed the head of their cartel. And the Nash Syndicate believes you killed their biggest supplier.
I’ll perform another magic trick. My jet will take you and the missus out of harm’s way. I know a lovely little spot on Namibia’s Skeleton Coast.
Where’s the bag? 
What’s that smell? Is that lavender? [ SNIFFING ] And mint. Is that your head? [ SNIFFS ] What kind of products do you use? I’m dying of curiosity.
You smell that?
I’ll say. [ INHALES DEEPLY ] Absolutely lovely. Whatever it is, you and I need to get some.
[ GRUNTS ] The other man. The one who was with us. Where’d he go?
[ To Dembe ] You all right? Come on.
Is that yours? [ Indicating the man’s car ]
Please. I need your car.
Thank you.
There was an accident.
Garvey got away.
You knew the meeting was an ambush. You have a source. Someone close to Garvey.
If that source was assisting you, Garvey knows that, and he’ll try to get to him. I assume that’s what you’re trying to do. Tell me. Where are you going?
I can help protect you from him.
Aram, I need to find Agent Keen. It’s urgent.
No, everything is not okay. She just hung up on me, angry and desperate, and I fear she’s blindly walking into a trap. I need to find her.
Aram, if your intent is to protect Elizabeth, protect her from Garvey, not from me. She’s in trouble.
I did. He got away. And now, like a hound on a hot scent, she’s going after an item Garvey took from me, and I have no doubt he’s headed the same way.
Where?
Do it. Now.
Because you killed him before he could. And if you try and tell it now, I’ll do the same to you. Utter one word. One article “A”-“An”-“The” – and I’ll shoot you.
Except to yourself.
Jennifer.
That’s entirely up to him. Dembe.
Smokey? Just a quick visit. Bless his heart, he was worried about me.
No.
So it seems. Dembe and I were in a minor car accident.
This is all wildly inconvenient.
So, how does it feel?
To know the man responsible for killing Tom is dead.
Garvey must have hidden it. Now that he’s gone, we have to accept the fact that it may never be found.
It was Jennifer, wasn’t it? How you knew that Garvey would betray our agreement and try to kill me at the meet.
You knew where she was, and you didn’t tell me.
I agree.
I do.
You heard the good doctor. It appears I’m not supposed to go anywhere.
I’m fine. Dr. Lomay has always been a Nervous Nellie.
I told Elizabeth I understood why Jennifer wouldn’t want to see me. I never said I wouldn’t try to see her.
Ian Garvey. I know he meant a great deal to you.
And I’m sorry for your loss.
Yes, I believe you.
If Garvey didn’t give it to you, it’s possible he gave it to your mother.
Which means you know where she is.
I need to find Naomi.
Anything from Stav?
He’s on her person and her phone?
Garvey must have had a death switch in place a way to get one of them the bag. We just need to find out what that is.
I’m sure Smokey’ll find out as soon as he’s finished adjusting his collar.
Judson.
Can we trust him?
As Alexander Fleming should have said but never did – good intel is the best antibiotic.
You all right?
See? ’66 Mustang, burnt orange metallic, white racing stripes? Ronnie, I couldn’t take my eyes off it. Stunning, really.
Oh, I know quite a bit about you, Officer Glanton. I confess, my first thought was to kidnap your wife, but word on the street is you may love that vehicle of yours even more than the wife.
That won’t be necessary. [ Red shows his gun ] I just need a small favor.
There’s an inmate on the cellblock you supervise. His name is Judson. I need to have a word with the man.
Help me make contact, and we’ll return the car unharmed.
I took the liberty of calling you a cab. Think about it.
[ On Walkie-Talkie ] Officer Glanton, welcome aboard.
That’s the agreement.
Look to your left, Ronnie. You’ll find the car right here when we’re done. The keys and a bonus prize for playing will be under the left rear floor mat.
[ Over earphone ] Mr Judson, good to see you up and about. For a moment there, I thought you might’ve suffered the same fate as your employer.
We have unfinished business. You have something that belongs to me.
Careful, Mr Judson. You’re at a crossroads. What you say next could determine the rest of your life.
Where did he go?
You’re a good friend who takes better care of me than I deserve.
Why would they tell you that?
Hello.
What changed?
A car will pick you up in half an hour.
You still are. Track down that address. Call me when you have.
Best-case scenario, Costa Rica tells us where the bag has been and where it’s going. Finding Naomi Hyland may tell us where the bag is. Dembe, inform Edward there’s been a change of plan.
You said you had some questions.
Please. Would you like coffee or tea, something to eat?
You haven’t asked any real questions yet. You’ve expressed curiosity about the tricks of my trade – a pedestrian form of legerdemain mastered by any number of experienced outlaws. That’s not why you’re here.
You want to know why your father abandoned you.
I’m saying a perfectly plausible narrative was created.
Secret societies exist. The Cabal, the Trilateral Commission – private organizations that harness powerful forces to tip the scales in their favor – military engagements, UN interventions, treaties. The Cabal is the one I stumbled across – and tried to destroy. To prevent that, they tried to destroy me.
You weren’t abandoned. You were protected.
In 1990, the KGB and the CIA had almost nothing in common except the mutual determination to hunt down one individual.
Being a fugitive from American law enforcement is a lot easier than being a fugitive from the two most powerful nations on Earth. And anyone close to a target of theirs becomes a target themselves.
Especially family. Unless they’re abandoned on the side of a road on Christmas Eve.
Put where the Cabal wouldn’t find you.
An effective, albeit excruciatingly painful solution.
You survived, as did your mother, to whom I hope you are now willing to take me.
This cannot be right.
What happened?
How?
No.
I’m sorry.
No, it’s not. It wasn’t nearly enough.
Yes.
Any word from Smokey?
I said those are the doctor’s orders. I never said that I would follow them.
Ah. Best laid plans. Now, if you’d excuse us, we’re wheels up in about 10.
Why is that?
In 1990, the KGB and the CIA had almost nothing in common except the mutual determination to hunt down one individual.
Being a fugitive from American law enforcement is a lot easier than being a fugitive from the two most powerful nations on Earth. And anyone close to a target of theirs becomes a target themselves.
I don’t, but I can get your prisoner to give it to me.
In my experience, conventional torture doesn’t yield much truth. Which is why I employ a man with a more holistic approach to enhanced interrogation. If his oxygen tank is full, he can be here in an hour.
What else do you know about her abductor?
Take advantage of my offer, Harold. Brimley’s an old friend, and I love him dearly. He’s not up for grabs. If it weren’t Samar, I wouldn’t offer his services.
[ On the phone ] Slow down, Smokey. Take a breath.
Carrying what?
I want you to secure an invitation to the party.
Call me when it’s confirmed.
I offered Harold my assistance. Now I’m just juggling.
You are absolutely right, Harold. It is not a weasel. It’s a badger.
Harold, understand, Bernice is a seasoned professional. Recently retired after years in the film and television industries, where she had a prolific career playing a long list of heavies. She’s worked with Eli Wallach, Faye Dunaway. I think she did two pictures with George Kennedy–
But don’t be fooled by her off-screen persona. She is an absolute devil who has never missed her mark and will perform whatever the scene calls for. Believe me – 10 minutes with Bernice and Brimley, and your prisoner will give us the name of Samar’s abductor.
Julius Hannelore?
He’s a broker of sorts. An associate recommended him to me after Mr Kaplan passed.
I’m on my way.
Listen, if my bringing Teddy here suggests a new open-door policy, let me set the record straight. My associates are just that – mine. And unless otherwise indicated, my meetings with them are private.
[ SCOFFS ] 
Julius. How do you do it? How do you make a person more presentable in death than they were in life?
I’m looking for Steven Feltmeyer.
This is a pressing matter. I don’t have time to go through channels.
I’m afraid I’m going to need my mackerel now, or else the Sulzbergers are going to need to close the casket.
I’d sooner take a knife to the “Mona Lisa,” but Feltmeyer has an associate of mine, and I’d like her back. Preferably before she needs her lips sewn shut.
Good luck with that. Where can we drop you?
If there was more I could contribute, I would do it gladly, but there isn’t. So, yes, I’m leaving.
My thoughts and prayers will be with you in your search. I hope that provides some consolation.
[ Reading ] It’s not on the list.
Or maybe it already sold.
Then there may still be time.
Excuse me. The person in charge, where might they be?
Tell him it’s Raymond Reddington.
Please, just tell him it’s Raymond Reddington.
I’ve heard steroids make your penis shrink. Have you found that to be the case?
He does know I’m Number One on the Wanted List, right?
[ LAUGHING ] Oh, I mean, obviously, he’s joking.
Yes, of course. If you could just direct me to the bathroom.
What about before it starts?
Or sold at auction.
Maybe. Maybe not.
[ WHISPERING ] I genuinely don’t want this to become unpleasant.
Hmm. You know, it’s awful, but people do tend to associate a thick neck with a low IQ. How about shattering that cliché by reasonably persuading him to change his mind?
Mm.
[ Loudly ] Point of order!
[ To the bidders ] Does it bother either of you, the terrorism of it all?
Either of you? No? Good. That makes this so much easier.
Ah, I thought you’d never ask.
How about $4 million for the Assyrian relief? That’s more than twice what your two highest bidders were offering.
And normally, I’d respect that, but I’m pressed for time, something a smart businessman such as yourself should take full advantage of.
Surely you can do better than that.
Done. On two conditions. First, you keep the proceeds. The terrorists get nothing. Tell them the shipment was lost or stolen or intercepted by Customs. I’ll find a more appropriate home for the relief.
I get the duffel bag.
The final item–
Ian Garvey came here. He brought you a duffel bag.
But- But he was here?
Then I have a third condition – I want to see your surveillance footage.
Yeah. That man. There.
I can.
Sutton Ross. He died years ago. [ CHUCKLES ] Or so I thought.
Garvey was a US Marshal. He put people in witness protection. Made them disappear or appear to be dead. Garvey must have made that happen for Sutton Ross. We came all this way to find the duffel has been handed from one enemy of mine to another.
I have no idea.
I spoke to Harold. 
He told me about Agent Navabi.
His guard, actually.
We developed something of a bond.
You follow me to where you don’t belong, watch tapes that are none of your business.
You do what you know I don’t want you to do.
You disappoint me. And yet, somehow, at the same time, you impress me. You persevere.
[ CHUCKLES ] I suppose it was inevitable.
Our sprint to the finish. The bag is just out of reach now. After everything we’ve been through, it won’t be long before one of us has it.
What would you say to flying back with me on my jet, enjoying a few hours of peace and quiet before we repair to our neutral corners?
Yes, it would be, if I was to offer that. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] Which I’m not. Goodbye, Elizabeth. I’ll be waiting at the finish line.
Ah, what a lovely shop. You certainly look busy as a beaver.
Yes, and I’m terribly sorry for the intrusion, but I need a moment of your time. It’s about a customer.
Oh, go for the side tabs. They keep you honest in the midsection.
Yes, I understand. Oh, my gosh! You’re– [ LAUGHING ] Oh, dear. I am such a fan.
Your films, your writing, your artwork. I can’t believe this. Do you get all your suits done here?
You probably get this all the time, but I must tell you, I absolutely adore–
Well, yes, but your Christmas show. I had tickets in Baltimore, and I was running so late, I only saw the last 20 or 30 minutes, but I have to tell you, it was one of the most surprisingly warm, incredibly nostalgic, funny evenings in my memory.
[ LAUGHING ] That story about the squirrel – the one with the tiny nuts. Oh, my God.
Oh. A lightweight merino. Super 120, natural stretch. I swear by it.
I’ll tell you if you tell me. [ Shows a photo ]  Your client, Sutton Ross – I’ve fallen out of touch with him over the years, but I do need to find him right away.
Mr Lundgren, take a closer look. The suit he’s wearing has your label stitched into the lining of the jacket.
Hm. No matter how powerful you think Sutton Ross might be, if you don’t help me–
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ]
Well?
Oh, John, yes. I like that. But go with the Snowy River Collection in the Glen Urquhart plaid. It worked for the Duke of Windsor. And, just my opinion, consider a vest.
Vests have never been out.
Ah! [ LAUGHS ] Good afternoon, Mr Jordan.
My name is Raymond Reddington. I don’t have time to explain all that that implies. Suffice it to say, I know you handle accounts for Sutton Ross. You’re gonna help me find him.
Where’s Elizabeth?
You need to leave Ross to me.
Advice.
You need to pull over.
Turn around.
Dembe, turn around.
Let me look at you. Come here.
Ah, that’s a deep cut. You’ll need stitches.
Yeah.
Keep pressure on it. I’ll call you an ambulance.
You’ll try, but there’s a fine line between fishing and standing on the shore, looking like an idiot.
It better, or we’re not gonna find Sutton Ross.
I didn’t give Sutton Ross bogus plans for the [ CHUCKLES ] Grayscape Seventeen.
Did he talk?
And the duffel bag?
What about Ross?
I don’t know what it is, but I know what it means. Ross is on to the next job, and the duffel may already be gone.
I’ll call the Twins in for cleanup. You alert Morgan. I want him on-site at the pharmaceutical plant.
We got eyes from about 200 yards southwest.
I want Ross and his hostage.
[ Over his phone to Morgan ] Wait. Hold, hold, hold, hold.
Stand down. Abort.
I want Ross.
It was a clever ruse, detaining the Serbians and inserting Ressler in their place.
Yes, clearly. So allow me to put a fine point on the cost of that decision. The duffel bag is mine. Its contents are personal. I want my privacy respected. You and Agent Keen are not honoring that, so I see no reason to honor our agreement.
Mine with the Task Force. It’s a simple ultimatum. I get Ross or the Blacklist ends.
I told you what I want.
You need to breach that room, right now.
“Trying” is the operative word. [ CHUCKLING ] He’s not gonna make contact. He’s not interested in negotiating.
Cut the power, blow the door, stun grenades followed by CS gas, and extract.
You can’t do that.
She’s right. He’s bluffing.
I’m not wrong. He’s bluffing.
Harold, if you give him that code, it’s unlikely you’ll ever see Agent Keen again.
The car’s a dead end. By now, he’s ditched it and stolen another one.
Yeah. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] Elizabeth?
Done.
Let me speak with her.
I want to talk to her.
That’s exactly what I’m going to do, Harold.
Now who’s putting her life in danger? 
Yeah?
You knew I couldn’t get here without the feds keeping a close watch. They’re rather protective of Agent Keen. But if you’re half as smart as you think you are, I’m sure you have a plan as to how we can lose them.
No.
Doesn’t matter.
You have nothing to apologize for. Not to me, ever.
My life for hers. That was the agreement. Let her go.
You don’t need to hurt her anymore.
If I tell, what guarantee do I have that you’ll let her go?
Enough.
The truth? The truth is that I am not–
Yeah. There are more of them in the back. They have Elizabeth.
Elizabeth. It’s over.
Done.
I want to talk to her.
Let her go.
I can’t let you do that.
Elizabeth. It’s over. [ Hugging her and stroking her hair ]
This is no way to rob a bank. This is– I Honestly, I don’t know what the hell this is.
It’s a disgrace. That’s what it is. You have a young mother on the ground. Her child is terrified. What the hell’s wrong with you?!
Don’t you bring that gun back up. Joe, put your gun down.
Joe. Come on. Clearly, this isn’t going to work out according to plan.
I’m on my sixth and final scout to rob the place. This Tuesday, in fact. That’s obviously been moved up. Charlie, would you please escort Lucinda to her desk where she keeps the master key to the safe-deposit room? I need box 604 post-haste. Don’t worry about him, Charlie. Just get the box. There we go.
Joe, you seem like a guy who gets distracted. If I were you, I’d forget about the box and worry about the bank’s new metal-detection system. Because it was specifically designed to silently detect the larger kinds of weaponry that marauders such as yourselves tend to be enamored with. Truth is, your cannons tripped the security system the moment you entered the building, which means you don’t have the precious seconds you thought you had.
Not quite.
Going to jail, evidently. You know, enough is enough. Everyone up. This is just unpleasant all around.
Except you can’t because the bank is surrounded by police. Now, I can get you out of here for 50% of the cash that you have on that cart.
Thank you, Charlie.
55 percent. Joe, my number’s only going up until you say yes or you get yourself arrested.
[ On phone ] Eli. About the truck for Tuesday. Yeah, uh, there’s been a change of plan. We need it now. No, no, like right now. Same place. That’s right. Now.
Liquor built that bank. Boss Varney ran the bank and half a dozen bars in the city. During Prohibition, Varney’s son operated the bars as speakeasies. They made a fortune off of bootleggers, moonshiners, and wine pirates. Laundered all the profits through the bank. The tunnel provided safe passage for all the cash and a warm way to walk to lunch during the winter months.
You made good time, Eli. Hop in, boys and girls. We’re going for a ride.
They’re shooting at the police. Honest to God, these guys.
[ CHUCKLES ] – Oh! – [ LAUGHING ]
I come bearing gifts.
Van Gogh’s “Poppy Flowers.” Everything about it just breaks my heart.
Yes. Twice, actually. From Cairo’s Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum. Once in 1977 and then again in 2010. Terribly embarrassing. It’s exchanged hands a couple of times over the years, but it came to my attention that the current owner was holding it here at your bank. Not to worry. I’m sure you had no idea. But I do think it’s time for the flowers to go back home again.
Yes, to the museum..
Well, I guess third time’s a charm. But now it’s your obligation to see that it’s returned to its rightful owner. My God, I hope they can manage to hold onto it this time around. Please don’t mention my name. I’d prefer it to be an anonymous donation.
Ha! That was sort of a gift to myself. I’m turning 60 this year. I wanted to see if I’ve still got it. Turns out I do. I have a feeling it’s gonna be a very good year. [ LAUGHS ]
You said this would be good for my health, Dembe, and you were absolutely right. I feel like a different person.
Hmm! I’ve turned over a new leaf. Spinach. Steamed. No butter, no oil, no salt.And very, very little taste.
What do you know about a man named Hans Koehler?
He’s the plastic surgeon of choice for the criminal underworld. A wizard at facial reconstruction. He’s hidden some of the very worst of the worst behind a larger nose, a pointier chin, higher cheekbones.
Find the doctor, find the criminals.
Opportunity. Dr. Koehler’s been sighted, which is as rare as sighting the pygmy three-toed sloth. Only 79 of the dear creatures are left.
On Koehler?
Basil Vladakis. Dear Lord. I haven’t heard his name in ages.
Changing a man’s face is one thing. Changing his predilections? Quite another.
Basil Vladakis was a vicious and wanton gunrunner whose love of money was only rivaled by his love for losing it at the track.
I know he was a regular punter at Mardale. Perhaps Dembe and I should be off to the races to see if we can’t scare up The Mad Greek. I certainly wasn’t the only one he stiffed before skipping town, but I’d still like my money back. And if he knows anything about Dr. Koehler’s whereabouts, well, then, as they say, “two birds.” Dembe, this could be fun. We haven’t been to a race since Smarty Jones cost us a bundle at Belmont. Perhaps Dame Fortune is ready to smile on us after all.
Is the across-the-board really the wisest bet? As I understand it, they’re expensive and have far less profit potential. Is that true?
[ LAUGHS ] It’s funny. You look like an old pro with a new face. The kind who likes taking other people’s money. I once knew a Greek arms dealer who took my money. Do you know how many times I’ve stood in this lousy sports bar looking for you? Clever to have your face reorganized. Looks good. Cute nose.
Blow your cover? [ LAUGHS ] That’s about to happen very quickly. Can you imagine? After all that nipping and tucking, the sucking and plucking. All that goes into changing a man’s face, creating a new identity, a new life, then be outed by some old pal at the same old racetrack? What a colossal waste of money and time.
Of course you will. But I’ll need a little something else to sweeten the pot, make up for lost interest.
I want you to put me in touch with the friend who fixed your face.
But you know how to reach him.
Then start dialing, because if you don’t, you’re gonna be naked and penniless in this lousy sports bar at Mardale.
Ooh. Oh, my God. You were right! Who would’ve thought the Daily Double – would be a smart bet?
Oh, my God.
Yes, absolutely.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I asked Mr. Hunt to page you, not for himself, but because I’m one of Dr. Koehler’s former patients, and I need to get in touch with the good doctor. My name is–
–Ah! Then you know I’m serious when I say it’s a matter of some urgency.
Until when?
May I ask you something? All the work that was done on poor Vladakis I mean, Mr. Hunt and yet, still, these earlobes. It’s like the grandkids have been hanging and swinging on them. Is there really nothing one can do to – I don’t know – shrink them up even just a little bit? You said the doctor texted you.
Perhaps I could borrow your phone.
Aram, it’s me. I’m gonna send you a cellphone, one I need you to examine as soon as possible. Yes, it’s about Dr. Koehler.
What the hell is really going on with Dr. Koehler? He wouldn’t simply pack up and go “on holiday” to France. He hates the French.
Yeah. Trouble. Never a truer word.
That’s it there? The brick one?
The FBI served their purpose in finding him.
Let’s go find out how badly Dr. Koehler’s been compromised.
[ SOFTLY ] Where is it?
What’s that?
He had information that’s important to me.
Our professional relationship is symbiotic. I help you, you help me.
I don’t have an alternate agenda. I have secrets. Like the skeleton. I thought you’d come to terms with that.
One has nothing to do with the other. Being honest means one doesn’t lie, deceive, or cheat. Where you are concerned, I don’t.
Dembe keeps things from me.
So one can keep certain things secret and be in an honest relationship?
The last thing I want is to push you away. So if we need a little truth and reconciliation to prevent that, well, what the hell? Just don’t get greedy.
You want to know my secrets, why I’m here, what the good doctor told me?
Then I’ll tell you. As soon as you tell me.
The secrets you keep from me.
Studies show that at any given moment the average person is keeping 13 secrets. 🔘 [ See Note ]  So come on. I actually think this could be quite fun. I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours.
It could be. If the secrets you keep are as loving as the ones Dembe keeps.
[ LAUGHS ] Well. That is interesting.
Tell me.
Hans Koehler was a friend of mine. I suspected he was being held against his will. I wanted to save his life. Sadly, I failed.
All? No. Enough? Certainly. The guard. Who was he?
The Corsican.
One of the world’s deadliest assassins is now one of the world’s most anonymous men. Which means he can act with impunity. Whatever he is up to I fear Dr. Koehler is only the beginning.
Mrs Koehler, I’m terribly sorry for your loss.
A friend of your husband’s. My name is Raymond. I’m here for the Picasso.
Well. This is unexpected.
How much do you know about your husband’s line of work?
He was away for months at a time, wasn’t he?
He did. Many of those clients were criminals. Some of them terrible men and terrible women.
It is. I should know. I’m one of them.
Your husband’s client list.
Yes. And to give you this. It’s a numbered bank account with $5 million in it and also the name of a man who’s standing by to create your false identification.
Other clients will come looking for this list. I don’t know how many or when. Just that they will. And you do not want to be here when they do.
As I said, Hans was a friend of mine. I wouldn’t be the person I am if it weren’t for him. I recommend Cairo. Beautiful, historic. And thanks to a combination of the Muslim Brotherhood and international Islamophobia, completely abandoned by Western tourists. You and Picasso will have the pyramids to yourselves.
Ah. I meant what I said before about our relationship being symbiotic. I help you, you help me. We help each other.
An insurance policy. Dr. Koehler was a not only a gifted surgeon, but also a man smart enough to know that his life was threatened by the very men and women who paid for his services. For that reason, he kept a dossier – a list of every face he changed.
Which is why he abducted Dr. Koehler and his team and forced them to operate at gunpoint.
No. But the names of countless others are men and women who abandoned their lives to hide. Now you can find them.
I told you mine. Now you tell me yours.
No, it’s not. One file has been deleted.
[ SIGHS ] I prefer to keep my nips and tucks to myself. Forgive an old man his vanity.
[ LAUGHS ] Not a pretty sight.m
Was I? I can’t remember.
Elizabeth?
Bad time?
May we?
As a fugitive from justice, I prefer not to linger in public hallways.
Hmm. Five pounds.
Seven pounds when it’s in the morning.
I feel like a different person.
I have news about the Corsican.
I warned you, Aaron. How many times? The arms business is like Ring Around the Rosie compared with this business you call show.
I once provided transportation for a Chinese cobalt magnate who insisted on funneling his ill-gotten gains into a three-picture deal with Woodman Blake. Huge hits, each one bigger than the last. Careers were made. Awards were won. A single dollar over a billion in net profits, and he stood to double his investment. The movies grossed almost $3 billion worldwide. In anticipation of his windfall, my associate purchased a mansion in Sydney and a yacht in Montenegro. When the studio accountants were finished sharpening their pencils, the net was $999 million to the crooked penny. He went into receivership, and his wife left him for a talent agent. Not that that’s gonna happen to you. I mean, financially, you’re screwed, but look at the bright side. Your wife’s dead, may she rest in peace.
Yes, his whereabouts. I’m told he reached out to you recently.
Aaron, I wouldn’t ask you to divulge information about a client if it weren’t urgent.
Oh, then how about the place where you’re sending the material he ordered?
And who was that?
Like a blast from the past. Hmm.
Elizabeth I have news about the faceless assassin you seek.
Yes, to deliver a bomb.
The device was purchased from one Maxwell Ruddiger. A lush, a scoundrel, an old friend, and a consummate technician of all things explosive.
Moreau simply needed a way to get his device into the building.
Unless they don’t. Moreau didn’t choose just anybody with security clearance. He specifically chose someone carrying a diplomatic pouch.
Elizabeth, the contraption you’re hunting for is a binary device that contains enough ammonium nitrate and hydrazine to wipe out the entire General Assembly if not take down the building itself, and it’s volatile. The slightest bump or jostle could detonate the thing without warning.
I know this because I’m sitting with the madman who built the damn thing.
We’re en route to you as we speak. You need to clear the building, locate that device, and find a way to get us to it, but do not let anyone near that widowmaker until I can get Ruddiger there to undo the devil he’s created. Understood?
Max, perhaps you should put down the gin and tonics. You have a job to do, and you’ll need steady hands.
Better have another.
[ CHUCKLES ] This is certainly a first.
The police and I have a special kind of relationship.
Yes, except the President gave Elvis a badge, and I don’t really need one.
Funny, it’s all so much smaller than I’d imagined. A little tacky. Reminds me of that road trip we took.
Yes, exactly, Graceland. I had the same reaction at Graceland. All rather unimpressive, actually. [ SNIFFS ] It smells kind of funny. How much time before this thing goes off?
Elizabeth, maybe we should find someone to get the man a drink. 
Ahh, honestly, the suspense.
[ SIGHS ] Do I really need to be here?
Ugh, I hate needles.
[ LAUGHS nervously ]
Okay, I really don’t need to stay for this part. All of the smacking and the whacking and–
What is it?
Oh, okay. Ruddiger, if there’s nothing else I can do for you, I think I’ll go exploring.
You can come to the U.N. any day of the week. For me, this is once-in-a-lifetime. The tug of history and all that. You should be fine.
[ LAUGHS ] 
[ LAUGHS ] 
Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, distinguished members of the General Assembly [ LAUGHS ] I come before you on the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – 
– Humbled to be the latest in a long line of politically questionable, formerly dashing strong men to address this hallowed hall. Castro, Gaddafi, and my personal favorite – 
– [ CHUCKLES ] Ah, Nikita. You may have helped the Soviet Union lose the Cold War –
– But you did it in style. Today, I want to bring to your  attention a topic of great interest to me – 
And I believe to anyone who cares about this revered institution – Cary Grant, or, specifically, his acid trips. 🔘 [See Note] 
Through five marriages, numerous lovers, allegedly both male and female, and over 70 films, including “North by Northwest,” arguably the greatest work ever produced here, he just kept right on tripping, and why not? Before LSD was weighed down by the counter-cultural baggage of Timothy Leary turning on, tuning in, and dropping out LSD was used to treat addiction, anxiety, and depression.
Standing here in the heart of an institution dedicated to diplomacy, I can say, from personal experience, LSD has made me significantly more enlightened, kind, considerate, and loving, and if people are more kind and loving, then the world will be, too.
There will be less crime, fewer acts of terror, more joy, more diplomacy, and far more fun.
Cary Grant once said after a particularly evocative LSD trip, “I imagined myself as a giant penis launching off from Earth – “like a spaceship.”
I’m not surprised. After all, he did build it.
What?
Did you know that Cary Grant’s original name was Archibald Leach? That he was born into poverty, the son of an alcoholic father and a depressed mother, and then reinvented himself as the paragon of WASP virtue and charm? [ Looking up ] Good for you, Archie. I’m a great fan of reinvention.
Or of becoming your true self, even if you have to take on a new identity to achieve it. Care to join me and Dembe and Ruddiger at the Red Brau Tavern? Celebrate with a warm pretzel and a cold beer?
[ SCOFFS ] After saving Manhattan, I feel I deserve a few carbs.
Max, we can fly you tonight, just as long as we are back in the hotel in time for the tennis. I don’t want to miss a moment of the women’s doubles, all right?
[ To Dembe ] Go ahead. I’ll meet you inside.
As if there was any other way.
[To vendor ] Three salted, two with mustard.
I am, metaphysically, but aren’t we all just a little?
George Murphy, Senior VP at Fine and Clean. We sell shower curtains, curtain rods, liners, the occasional soap dish.
Is there a problem, Officer?
Assistance with what? Deciding whether to go salted or unsalted?
Fine, salted. Just don’t blame me for the aneurysm.
Isn’t this exactly the kind of harassment that makes people hate the police?
And here I was hoping to surprise you.
Shower curtains, mildew-resistant fabrics.
Trick of the trade.
You know what you fellas always say, that phrase? “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”
Actually, it’s entirely up to you. One way or the other, I’ll be set free. Indictments and trials are obviously the hard way. The easy way is for you and your family to suddenly become grotesquely rich, buy one of those offensive mega-yachts, and travel the oceans like a nouveau Jacques Cousteau.
A statement of fact. You simply haven’t lived until you’ve skinny dipped in the clear blue waters off the coast of La Ciotat.
A pot of gold waiting at the end of the rainbow for anyone smart enough to make the call.
My autograph, and a short dedication. Something to make it personal. If you insist on being a flatfoot for the rest of your life, you should sell it on eBay, buy some orthotics.
Ah.
Would’ve been a nice boat.
As pleasant as that sounds, I’m afraid I’ve made other arrangements.
Winning always is.
I need you to focus.
Focus on what happened.
How it happened.
This wasn’t an accident. My luck didn’t just run out. Someone tipped them. Someone close.
The cops were tipped off. Not specifically about me. That would’ve triggered a larger presence, and I would’ve noticed. Whoever did this told the cops as little as possible. Something about a middle-aged white male carrying a concealed weapon, something a couple of cops could follow up on quietly, discreetly.
That’s what I need your help to find out. Forget about the prosecutor and all this. I’ve been a step ahead of them for decades. I’m confident this won’t change that.
I need to find the person who betrayed me.
I’d say that depends.
They won’t let me see Marvin Gerard.
I’m being denied my counsel of choice.
Of course they are. They’re political animals. In the short run, justice always loses to politics.
I’m confident I’ll prevail. I want to talk about the news. The Marshals have been watching all morning.
I’m not talking about me. There was a story about bodies found in a Virginia warehouse.
What if I told you I knew who conducted that experiment? His name is Dr. Spalding Stark, and he’s the next name on the Blacklist.
Dr Stark presents as as renegade, a biohacker, devoutly dedicated to enhancing human life by hacking our genetics.
He approached a company of mine about a year ago, asked for help acquiring some advanced gene-editing equipment. I must say, he was very convincing.
Some of our most revolutionary scientific achievements come from minds outside the mainstream. I helped him because I thought – he was quite possibly a visionary.
And now there are five dead bodies in a warehouse suggesting otherwise. Now I fear Stark may be the worst kind of charlatan, the kind who preys on the weakest among us for his own financial gain.
Y-Your Honor, may I be heard?
And I would, Your Honor, no question, but given how quickly things are proceeding, I get the distinct impression that Jerry here has a bus to catch.
[ CHUCKLES ] I’m just saying there are important matters to discuss.
Well, for starters, Your Honor hasn’t really considered the issue of bail.
Okay. I, for one, feel better knowing it was considered.
I’m afraid so. May we approach?
You hang here, Jerry. This will only take a sec.
And I assure you, neither am I. But the fact remains the prosecution has intentionally failed to inform the court of a critical factor in this case.
My Immunity Agreement with the federal government, an agreement that expressly covers the charges before you and protects me from overzealous beavers like Mr. Sima and his bosses.
Assistant Director Harold Cooper of the FBI is here. He may be able to shed some light on the matter.
[ LAUGHS ] Shouldn’t judges at least pretend to be impartial?
Oh, it exists. Harold and I have been at this for over five years now. Of course, some of the people who originally approved it are either dead or have moved on, leaving Director Cooper to deal with the cover-their-asses crowd, who, by the way, are perfectly happy to milk this cow all the way to the slaughterhouse. I’m sure the first question they asked in response to my arrest was whether I could still continue to be an effective asset while locked up in jail – am I right, Harold?
Actually, I don’t think that’ll be necessary.
Because after careful consideration of the circumstances, I feel it more prudent to represent myself.
Thank you. Hello, Harold. Thank you, by the way.
Being honest. I regret I had to rely upon your integrity just to get this hearing. I wish there’d been an easier way.
I haven’t even asked anything yet.
Just one, Your Honor, and it’s this. Would you do it again?
The deal we made – my cooperation in exchange for my freedom. As the man who oversaw the arrangement in all its grand and often gory detail, would you do it again?
Why? Sorry, I had two questions.
Oh, for goodness sake.
Objection.
Your Honor, I object to almost everything about him, beginning with his power tie – and ending with his general demeanor.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Objection. He’s arguing with the man, and, frankly, being incredibly self-righteous.
Well, now he’s just being insulting.
[ EXHALES DEEPLY ] [ CLEARS THROAT LIGHTLY ] [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] This decision was made many years ago. The fact is, a small group at the Department of Justice did their due diligence, and with the blessing of the Attorney General and Legal Counsel at the White House, they concluded that the benefit that law enforcement and, consequently, the American people would gain from my assistance would exceed that of the rather abstract benefit of seeing a man of my alleged infamy being punished in a public fashion.
The point, Mr. Sima, is that your outrage doesn’t concern me. What concerns me is that the powerful men and women who made this deal and those who reaped the benefits of it for years actually considered it an option to deny its existence. They decided to say that what happened never happened.
Thank you, Harold.
Thank you, Your Honor. We really should do this again some time.
Oh, please. Violated it how?
But that’s a state crime.
To prove that, the gun would have to be admissible in evidence.
Because the officer who seized it was conducting an unreasonable search and seizure.
I am, a-and I do.
Where are they taking me?
Elizabeth, I’ll be fine. Will you do me a favor and ask one of the Marshals where I’m being transported?
Harold? What happened yesterday on the stand –
You testified because you value the truth. I know it couldn’t have been easy.
Yes, well – a lucky confluence of interests. I admit, for a moment, I thought you might decide that our time together should end.
We can talk more once I’m settled.
You got him?
And this Webb, he confessed? 
Do you smell that?
Would you be so kind to reach out to facilities? I’d like to put in a repair request.
No, no, no. Please stay. I’m happy for the company. Raymond Reddington. Awaiting trial.
[ CHUCKLES ] Such hyperbole. I don’t know whether to be flattered or horrified. What’s your name?
Hello, Vontae. Nice to meet you.
Ha! “The Bunker.” Is that what they call it? I’ve always wanted a home with a name. So much more evocative than a simple address. Fallingwater, the Dibble House, Sinking Spring Farm. I must say, The Bunker compares rather favorably to a Malagasy cave I once had the misfortune of inhabiting.
The Bunker.
Who’s the warden speaking with?
And if my tastes run in other directions?
Oh, I love cinnamon toothpicks.
I’m familiar with the incident.
That’s not your lunch meat.
You must not have heard what I said. I said that wasn’t your lunch meat. He’s just a kid. Maybe you can cut him some slack. Just a thought.
[ CHUCKLES ]
If you so much as look at Vontae’s pimento loaf again, you’re gonna end up with your teeth sticking out the back of your head and sipping your dinner through a bendy straw.
[ Looking up, COUGHS ]
[ WEAKLY ] So far, so good.
An old acquaintance.
Getting caught after 30 years? The odds were, I’d be caught after three. It’s no one’s fault, least of all yours. Besides, I welcome the vim and vigor of prison life, the law of the jungle. I am the lion, after all.
[ CHUCKLES ]
That’s a terrible idea.
Elizabeth, I’m the one who petitioned to be put into the general population. I need to be treated like the criminal I am. Anything that may hint at any involvement with your Task Force is a liability I cannot afford.
Which is why I need you to get Rod and Delaine Uhlman.
It’s time to go to work.
Shh, shh, shh, shh. I’ve been trying to free this ornery thread for nearly an hour.
I finally got a good hold on the little rascal.
Ah, damn it.
He’s still stuck on that?
Day after? What’s wrong with tomorrow?
[ LAUGHING ] Oh, come on. It’s like high-school fisticuffs.
Maybe you could find me a pen.
Vontae, one other thing. I wonder if you’d be willing to find out who’s playing that music. I hear music, and I’m certain that’s a record. If someone has a phonograph on the block, I would love to borrow, rent, or buy it.
Like a good son. Be proud.
Did you bring the meat?
Ah, perfect – right there. [ Indicates where to put the meat down ]
I found myself with something of a rodent situation.
Vontae, might I offer you a bit of unsolicited advice?
Fear is a liar.
It activates the enemy. All we can do is what we can do, and right now, what you can do is help me tie more of this string. Careful. It tangles easily.
That’s it. Come on – 
[ CHUCKLES ] Hello, there, little fella. We’ve got a lot of work to do.
Aah, there’s a spot.
Greetings, gentlemen. Please don’t get up. I come in peace. I’ve heard rumblings on the wire that you’re planning some sort of school-yard ambush, and I thought it prudent to see if we can work things out over a meal, break bread, settle our differences. Pimento loaf isn’t really my thing. In fact, when I get out of here, my very first stop will be Augustine in Manhattan for a simple omelet. Yum. What about you?
You must be the one with that record collection I envy so dearly.
Jack-o’-lantern.
A pumpkin is a gourd. A jack-o’-lantern is the carved pumpkin. Either way, it doesn’t matter. I knew what you meant. I still envy your record collection. Baldomero, what do you say we call this whole thing off? What happened in Iztapalapa was a terrible mistake. I regret it dearly, and I had no idea she was your mother.
Okay, in our defense, it was incredibly dark, and we’d been drinking heavily. Honestly, [ CHUCKLES ] I regret the entire weekend. Of course, don’t tell your mother that.
A Romani fortune teller once gave me an astonishingly accurate peek into my future, and I’m gonna do the same for you. You and I are never gonna see each other again after tomorrow, but when you do walk out of this calaboose, I promise you this within 24 hours of your release, you’ll be lying on the floor with a blade in your belly, gurgling my name and begging to die. Okay, then. Good talk. Get some rest, fellas. It’s gonna be a big day.
The plan is a bit of a work in progress.
He’s not an inmate. He was a cave explorer in Kentucky around the turn of the last century. He explored Kentucky because of the hundreds of miles of interconnected underground caverns. But in the winter of 1925, while trying to find a new entrance to Crystal Cave, Collins became trapped in a narrow crawlway 55 feet below ground. But it’s rumored that, in order to find an escape, Collins lit a candle, held it up, and let the smoke draft point him toward an exit. Here. Hand me the rat.
If this little fella found his way in, I bet he can find his way back out, like a draft of smoke or a carrier pigeon.
Well, either way, we’ll likely be dead by Friday.
[ CHUCKLES ] Collins actually died in the cave – thirst and hunger compounded by exposure, hypothermia – after 14 days in a cave?
Ah.
[ CHUCKLES ] That’s a lovely sentiment, Vontae, but I’m afraid this conflict predates out acquaintance.
Thank you, Vontae. Just don’t get in the way of anything sharp.
[ To Vega ] Where’s my record player?
Any last words, Baldomero? I’m sure we’d all like to hear them.
My accomplishments are an open book, but you – I don’t know. Coming clean might be good for your soul.
Well, surely, your prison-yard playmates would love to hear the truth that you’re awaiting trial for and bragging about a crime you didn’t commit? Well, it’s true, isn’t it? Don’t get me wrong. You deserve to be incarcerated for any number of ungodly crimes, but you didn’t heist that armored truck.
I know because Ziggy Chapman and his kid brother Tip stole the rig to pay off a debt they owed me. I refused the cash, of course, as it was unlaundered and the boys were way too hot, what with the dead guards. The brothers had to pawn the damn truck along with its contents.
Listen, at least you’re in here telling lies with your buddies instead of on the street, looking over your shoulder for Anunzio Ross. Why you did him dirty, I have no idea. Anunzio has a long memory and a passion for vengeance, which is, presumably, why you’re not trying particularly hard to get out of here. Am I wrong?
That acrid scent lingering in the air is bull feces, the stench of a man who’s in prison for a crime he didn’t commit but takes credit for because he’s afraid of Anunzio Ross.
[ CHUCKLES ] Well, what do you know?
What? I gave you the Pawnbrokers. I thought you’d be happy.
Is that why he was released?
I know I did what I had to do to stay alive long enough to win my freedom back.
I assume that was a rhetorical question.
That may be. But life is often surprising. And death is even more so.
Ah, Vega. Look at you, bearing gifts. Come in, come in. Ah.
Vontae, you look excited.
I heard. I spoke with Officer Frye. I think you’re gonna be a lot happier in there.
I’ve grown rather fond of my dark, little corner.
[ CHUCKLES ] Well, let’s give it a shot.
To the small things in life.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Yes, Your Honor, on the grounds that the search was unreasonable and therefore a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
One of my favorite Amendments. Top three. Maybe five.
Your Honor, please. I’m on pins and needles as it is, and you’re not helping the matter.
And I appreciate your concern.
Which I have.
We’re both legal professionals. Your business is to apply the law. Mine is to break it. You studied your profession. Why would you assume I haven’t studied mine?
If you’re referring to the reasonable-suspicion standard as articulated by Justice Warren in Terry v. Ohio, I am.
A-Apologies, Your Honor. If I could request a brief recess.
I’m sorry. Did you say something?
Michael, really. The process is brutal enough. I’m doing my very best despite my feelings about you. You could at least make the effort to be civil.
That it is. I need to meet with the FBI about a time-sensitive case. My immunity agreement may be in jeopardy, but while it remains intact, I intend to live up to its obligations.
I have a situation.
Ever since word of my capture hit the press, certain associates are looking to kick me to the curb.
Harris Van Ness.
Do you know who I’m talking about?
Van Ness was murdered because of his business affiliations with me.
[ CHUCKLES ] There are no accidents around me. Not unless they’re on purpose.
Ah! [ LAUGHS ] What a pleasant sight.
Thank goodness for the prison chaplain.
Oh, it had the dual benefit of getting you in here and also being true. Van Ness is dead. Without him, I don’t have the votes to prevent Androssani from cutting me off. I need you to reassure Androssani. Reason with him. And if that doesn’t work, kill him. That should scare up a vote or two.
We’ll see.
You do know I didn’t really ask you here to give me spiritual advice, right?
I need that vote.
Everything rests on this.
Something has to be done.
I make my own fate.
[ BREATHES DEEPLY ] I’m asking you to do this.
I’m finished serving the public good for the moment, Your Honor. So, yes, the Government may once again go about its business of trying to execute me.
Uh, o-objection.
That’s not entirely correct, Your Honor. The suit is actually a prunelle weave blue with a subtle overlay of red. So in the right light, it goes quite plum.
Furtive? Is that what it was?
Objection.
No. A bulge at my waistline? I’d prefer that the witness leave my bulges out of this entirely.
I want that struck from the record. It’s embarrassing.
That radio run – According to your arrest report, it was based on an anonymous tip.
So someone called 911 and said that a white man in his 50s wearing a suit and a hat was in the vicinity of the Red Brau Tavern – and that man had a gun.
And this tip came from someone you never spoke to, someone who also refused to give his or her name – to the police operator.
Completely anonymous, not a trusted source known to have been reliable in the past.
What investigation was that?
Which I provided immediately.
[ CHUCKLES ] No, you didn’t know that at the time. That license was created by the preeminent document forger in the world. Not in this country. On the planet. There’s not a chance you could have known it was a fake.
Officer Baldwin, I’ve been evading the police and law enforcement for almost 30 years. I’m the most wanted man in the world. At the time of our encounter, I was armed with a Browning 9-millimeter semi-automatic with a round in the chamber and the hammer cocked. Do you really expect this court to believe that a marshmallow disguised as a patrol officer, a comic figure in an ill-fitting uniform, could possibly make me nervous?
[ LAUGHS ] There he is. There’s the real Officer Baldwin. You didn’t search me for looking nervous. The truth is I was disrespectful.
I was disrespectful, you got angry, and you decided right then and there to show me you were in charge.
I was a wise ass. You said as much to your fellow officers at the scene. Tell you what – I’ll apologize for my behavior if you apologize for the illegal pat-down that has exposed me to the death penalty. No? Think about it. No further questions, Your Honor.
I want to hear the tape.
Of the anonymous call.
Exactly. How do I know it even exists? How do I know you’re not fabricating the entire call as a way to justify the search?
Oh, come on. The government pretended my immunity agreement didn’t exist. How do I know you’re not pretending the tape does?
Yes, and he relied on the information that was relayed in that call.
I was targeted. I want to know why.
I have a Sixth Amendment right to confront my accusers.
What history? I haven’t made any threats. And in case you’ve forgotten, I’m in federal custody.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Objection.
What did he have, Your Honor?
Officer Baldwin. A tip from a source who refused to give their name. No explanation as to how their information was acquired, no prior history of reliability, no compelling reason to believe the tip was even credible. And the details? A white man in his 50s wearing a suit and hat? On a busy street in New York City? I couldn’t possibly have been the only one.
He’s still dead. When he expired, so did his vote.
Van Ness doesn’t have an heir.
What a pleasant surprise.
Mm.
So, I guess I’ve got that going for me.
I was wrong about Van Ness. I was so sure my enemy was out there when he was in here all the time. I must be getting old. Either that, or I’m facing a particularly worthy adversary.
I was set up.
There’s a recording of the person who tipped off the cops.
What goes on in court – yeah, there are rules, people play their parts. Your enemies are known. It’s a fair fight. And despite losing today, it’s only just begun.
No.
[ INHALES DEEPLY ] – But I intend to. And when I do, I’ll know who betrayed me. And at that moment, no matter where I am – on the street, in solitary confinement, or on the receiving end of a firing squad – at that moment, whoever set me up – his fate will be sealed.
We are not. Uh, the royal “we” – me. I am not.
Like it or not, I have to be open to the idea that there may be certain mental abnormalities that are the cause of my criminal conduct.
Well, I cannot proceed to trial until I know how to [ CHUCKLING ] defend myself, or whether I can even self-advocate in an effective way.
And if the facts indicate that I’m not competent to stand trial?
[ LAUGHS ]
While I’ve come to appreciate the innate facility Mr. Sima has with the obvious cliché, I’m sure the Court is aware that, on the subject of my mental health, his opinion is just that – his opinion. I’d prefer to take the Court’s recommendation and base my defense on the facts.
I am making that motion now, as is my right under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, I ask for the court’s indulgence because I appear before you in pro per, and also possibly mad as a hatter.
[ LAUGHS ] Guilty as charged. Or not – if I really am mad. How about giving us all a chance to find out? 
I didn’t request the evaluation – so I’d be evaluated.
I did it because I no longer have an Immunity Agreement, and I need leverage to get a new one.
Because it gets me to Missouri. There’s a man I need to see there.
This is a comfy chair.
It’s comfy?
And yet I don’t [ INHALES DEEPLY ] understand why I’m there in court. I don’t know what I’ve done wrong.
Not really, no.
Polluting rivers kills people, good people killed – for profit. Raising the speed limit kills people – to save time. The death penalty. Unjust wars have killed so many people. Whatever I’ve done, I’ve done because I thought it was just. So, do I really understand the proceedings against me? No, I don’t.
If they’re designed to see whether I can distinguish between the behavior the system defines as criminal and that which I deem appropriate – I can’t.
Ah. Inkblots. I must warn you, they all look like genitalia to me.
[ LAUGHS ] There you go.
Hello, Atticus. It’s been a while. I was sorry to hear about all the tomfoolery in Cincinnati, but I’m confident it’ll all blow over and you’ll be acquitted soon. I came here because I need a favor.
It’s about our mutual acquaintance. I need to find him. I’m in trouble, and I need to find him. If anyone can help me, it’s you. This is important, Atticus.
It’s a matter of life and death.
I’m sorry?
Knock yourself out.
Jiminy Christmas!
For the love of– Please tell me that’s not a Vermilion Flycatcher.
That little fella right there. What the hell are you people doing with a Flycatcher in your aviary? They’re endangered. That little guy should be in an open habitat or desert scrub, at the very least.
You know what? Never mind. I am absolutely dead wrong. That is a Red Factor Canary. Probably domestically bred. He’s perfectly fine.
One thing at a time, Atticus. I’ll get you sober, and then you can tell me how to find your friend.
Everyone’s favorite superpower is flying like a bird. [ CRUNCHING candy ] I’d prefer mind control. Although, at this point, maybe just X-ray vision.
Hello, Atticus. Welcome back.
Why?
Whether I’m easily awakened by noise?
[ SIGHS ] When I sleep, I sleep.
Yes.
Good? No.
Not necessarily.
[ To Atticus ] I need to find your colleague.
It’s important that I find him.
No. I get even. [ Pause ] Is that a look of concern or keen interest?
Keen interest, then.
Is that it? After all your inkblots and questions about my digestive tract, that’s the depth of your analysis, that I deviate from societal norms? Given that my life depends on your learned evaluation, I hope you have something slightly more insightful on that notepad.
Atticus. Atticus, look at me –
You’re in a hospital awaiting trial. They have you on a strong cocktail of antipsychotics.
Yes, you’re in Springfield.
Y–  Lis– Listen to me. It’s very important that I locate your colleague.
No, yes. I know he’s gone. I need to find him.
F– Atticus, forget the doctor. Can you help me find him?
I am so sorry, Doctor. I abhor tardiness, but if you could just give me one moment.
Calm down.
That’s enough, really.
Atticus, calm down.
Atticus–
No! No!
Well, I guess there won’t be much more from him, now, will there?
Atticus. Atticus. We don’t have much time.
Hey. Hey. Your friend has a job. It’s an assassination. Look at me. He knows the FBI is looking for him, so it has to be done quietly.
Hey, hey. Hey. Your friend – who would he turn to to get a job done as quietly as possible? Atticus, who would he turn to?
Ge- General [ STAMMERING ] Who’s that? I-I don’t– General Shiro? Hey, where can I find him?
Please tell me you’re going to be administering the Szondi test. I’m absolutely fascinated by repressed impulses.
That seems premature.
You keep calling him my friend. He’s not my friend.
My reaction?
I’m not so sure of that.
I’m an open book.
No, Your Honor. I’m prepared to accept the finding of competency.
Yes, thank you, and not a moment too soon.
I spoke with Atticus Rodrick.
He gave me a name – General Shiro. I need you to find out everything you can about him.
Yes. He’s the next name on the Blacklist.
Yesterday morning, a bio-tech company executive met a gruesome death.
I’m giving you a case.
I’m picking a jury of my peers. Wouldn’t that be a colorful lot.
If you’re accusing me of using the Task Force to assist me in avoiding the hangman’s noose, – guilty as charged.
I’m fighting for my life. And you are helping more than you know.
You remind me so much of your mother. I don’t remember if I’ve ever told you that before, have I?
I’m here because someone betrayed me, someone close. Under the circumstances, it’s hard to know who to trust.
What do you know about entomological warfare?
I’m sorry if you find the process of selecting a fair jury to be inconvenient, Mr. Sima, but you are trying to kill me for a crime I didn’t commit.
How can I sensibly judge one’s character if I don’t know their views on great literature?
In case you haven’t read a newspaper recently, Mr. Sima, all of our lives are playing out in the theater of the absurd these days. Your Honor, I believe the prosecution wants to intentionally dumb down the jury questionnaire because he wants to attract dumb jurors because Mr. Sima wants a jury of unsophisticated, unthinking sheep who will blindly convict me of treason out of some misguided notion that it’s the patriotic thing to do. I, on the other hand, want astute jurors, people who can understand the somewhat complicated evidence I plan to present, capable of evaluating not only my motives, but also those of the government.
Excellent. That sort of bias will only aid in my appeal should the government win in this round of play.
Okay, I will not be judged by anyone who likes Schumann. I refuse to be sent to my death by Philistines.
I’m sorry for your loss.
“The government wouldn’t spend the time charging someone with treason if they were innocent.” “Innocent” is misspelled, by the way, and the apostrophe is misplaced in “wouldn’t.” None of these answers instill me with great confidence in our jury pool.
Thanks. Why is it that spiritual advisers such as yourself are always so insistently optimistic? Just once I’d like to hear a man of the cloth say, “Yep, this sucks.” Dembe, we need a juror I can count on, one person capable of convincing the others to vote not guilty.
Yes, from the registered voter logs, the IRS, and the Department of Motor Vehicles. Fortunately, we have a friend at the DMV.
Yes, Your Honor. It means that by the time the jury is seated, there won’t be a Schumann lover in the bunch.
We’ll certainly keep you in mind for that.
Thank you for your service.
Your Honor, I’d ask that this juror – be dismissed for cause.
A close member of her family was victimized by crime. I think it’s reasonable to question her ability to be impartial.
And I’m sure she believes that.
No, thank you, Your Honor.
Your Honor, I’d give a dozen strikes to dismiss this juror.
Respectfully, I move to strike for cause.
No, because it appears he already thinks I’m guilty.
That won’t be necessary. Your Honor, this juror is acceptable to the defense.
Move to strike.
Strike, Your Honor.
Do you believe in the rule of law?
Your Honor, the defense accepts and welcomes this juror.
So you like pugs.
Even with all the scratching and the wheezing, the drooling and the gassiness?
I think you love them because they suffer. Perhaps because you suffer.
Your Honor, this juror said she favors the death penalty and that her husband was a cop. With all due respect, she certainly qualifies as an obvious dismissal on my part.
Ah, well, you see, but it is. It’s cause for hope. Only people with a healthy dose of empathy are capable of caring for beasts with such deficits.
That’s what some people see. You clearly see something else.
Give it time. I’ve been known to wheeze and scratch. I prefer not to discuss the drool and the flatulence. Your Honor, this juror is acceptable to the defense.
Y-Your Honor, we’ve been at this for several hours now. Might we take our mid-morning break? I’m feeling a little unwell. Just 15 minutes till I get my legs back.
What the hell happened?!
Glen?! Honestly. Glen?
And if it isn’t bad enough, now my fate rests in the hands of Jelly Bean Carter!
I’m not talking to him.
What the hell are you doing here? And where are the people I asked for?
Stra-! Glen, Dembe gave you very specific instructions.
D-Don’t call me boss, and you cannot do this.
I-I don’t even know what that means.
I might as well just ask the judge to let me go lie down in traffic. [ SIGHS ]
On what grounds? That he’s open-minded? That the abuse that’s been heaped upon him as a result of his decidedly unpleasant personality has made him reluctant to do unto others as they have so often done unto him? This isn’t a popularity contest. Mr. Sima’s dismissiveness is, I’m sure, an all too familiar event in this man’s life. He’s odd and annoying and clearly incapable of following instruction.
I think it’s safe to say that even those who know him best, perhaps – especially those who know him best – probably hold him in remarkably low regard. But the lamentable characteristics that make him an outcast are the very ones that make him perfectly suited to sit on this jury. Beholden to no one because no one likes him.
Capable of making up his own mind because he’s incapable of listening to anyone else. He is an outcast. Maybe even deservedly so, but if he’s able to administer blind justice in this case, I think we should give him a chance with the blindfold.
Or a parable for our times the common man forced to do something uncommon to make ends meet.
You were on the jury! You’d been picked! All you had to do was stop talking!
No, what you said was catastrophically stupid.
I cut you?
[ Grimaces; SIGHS ] I’m sorry.
You were, Glen.
On second thought, I prefer insistent optimism.
That case I gave the Task Force – have they identified General Shiro?
I need you to get into his lab, get to his files.
An address for my get-out-of-jail-free card. I believe Nikkila must have sent him some of his toxic bug juice. And without Glen, he is the last rabbit in my hat. The only way out of this situation is to find him, and the way to find him is somewhere in Nikkila’s lab.
Thank you, Dembe. I don’t care if it’s insistent optimism or false hope. At this point, I’ll take either one.
What a nice surprise. Oh, if I’d known you were coming, I would’ve baked a cake. Don’t suppose you have one on you, perhaps with a file or a blowtorch in it?
Ah, pity.
[ Claps his hands and LAUGHS ] Grab a chair.
I was thinking earlier about the time Dembe and I were on a trawler that capsized during a typhoon off the Philippines. We were running guns to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
I find desperation pays well.
[ LAUGHS at Cooper’s joke ] The boat was too full to begin with, so when the storm caught up with us, we didn’t stand a chance. Of the 40 people on board, 24 were lost right away. Another 11 didn’t last the night. There was no life raft. The militia leaders took the three available life vests.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I didn’t. I drowned that night. I saw the other side. It was – so different.
And then I was back. How he did it – Found a wooden door, held me to it, pounded the water out of my lungs and the life back in. Dembe saved my life that night. Dembe’s always saved my life.
That’s a smug little grin.
We’ll see about that.
[ GRUNTS SOFTLY as he pulls a packet through the pipe ]
I got your message. What’s the news?
An address, not a name?
You need to go there.
Nothing, not until we know what he plans to do with the toxin. I’d love to have something to trade the government in exchange for my freedom.
[ To Dembe ] I have to go.
You think?
Is this connected, perhaps, to that little dust-up earlier?
You say “groups,” but you mean gangs.
How unfortunate.
What’s the plural of Cyclops anyway? “Cyclopses”? Or is it like “deer”? Singular and plural? Not to mention a cyclops is an epically tragic figure. Blinded by the hero with some flaming stick. Homer, Euripides?
So the winner is forced to punish the infraction or risk making his own gang look weak.
I’d like to help, but as you can see, I’m preparing for trial. So–
I’m respected because I mind my own business, and I intend to keep it that way.
Thank you.
I have no earthly idea what would bring you here at 3:00 a.m., but I was in the midst of a glorious dream with two mermaids, a sea cucumber, and an octopus.
What’s wrong?
I didn’t realize you and Jennifer were still in contact.
From a drug dealer like Sarkany?
Does Jennifer use drugs?
What are you not telling me?
Sarkany is an Eastern European purveyor of LSD. Even if she was using something, Jennifer would not be worth the time and effort to get nabbed. There must be more to the story.
I generally practice willful ignorance when it comes to the drug trade. On the other hand, this place is crawling with inmates who don’t share my reservations. I’ll ask around.
I hope so, for Jennifer’s sake, as well as my own. I’m having a bit of a tug-of-war with the warden over Beethoven’s violin sonatas. This might be just what I need to return the maestro to his rightful place.
I’ve decided our interests are aligned.
Oscar Sandoval. Maybe a meeting in the mess hall.
Well, I’d just hate to have the day get away from us.
In part, yes. As I understand it, your brothers aren’t being very brotherly toward you.
You know who I am.  
It’s a simple question. Do you know who I am?
No one sends me anywhere. As I said, I’m here in part because of your problem, but also because that I have a problem of my own. You help me solve mine, and I’ll help you solve yours.
Talk to a few of the managerial members of your group. Help me to find the man they call Sarkany. My information puts members of his organization in Federal Hill in Baltimore. Maybe someone you know can pick up the trail from there.
Who does?
Who’s she?
Marguerite. Marguerite what?
What else did you find out?
Because based on what you’ve already told me, I’m deeper in your debt than you could ever be in mine.
He’s converting the cash to untraceable cryptocurrency.
Later. I have something more urgent for you to handle.
Elizabeth knows. She knows I was once someone else. She doesn’t know who, but she is looking for someone who can tell her. Marguerite Renard. We need to get to Renard before she does.
I don’t know. And we don’t have time to find out, because after I tell you how to locate Renard, I’m also gonna tell Elizabeth.
Because she’s looking for her sister, Jennifer, who was kidnapped and possibly taken to a place where Renard is located. Telling Elizabeth may be the only way to save Jennifer’s life.
That may be. You just get to Renard first so I don’t regret it.
To find Jankowics, you’ll have to start with one of his couriers. I’m told she’s a young woman, white, with red hair.
She’s arriving later today at Dulles on a plane registered to FarTide Holdings coming from Montreal.
How’d you pull it off?
Thank you, Vontae. Vega.
I did. I understand you’re the Grand Poobah of Rock River.
This ugliness between your boys and the dreadfully named motorcycle boys – I need that to stop.
Vontae here says you’re a reasonable man. No doubt that’s why you’ve risen to the highest rank in your organization. So your decision to support your soldier who’s refused to pay a legitimate debt is confounding. Your man owes money. I want him to pay it.
Very.
[ To Cyclops leader Matt Quill ] What the hell did you do?
I handled it. They were gonna pay. It was done.
No, I think you’re the one who needs to watch yourself. In fact, I’d keep all three of your eyes open. You never know when you’re gonna to run into a hero with a flaming stick.
You asked me to try to stop a young man’s murder and he’s dead.
Oscar Sandoval’s still dead.
You could prosecute his killer.
Nothing if not pragmatic. In any case, thank you for the amenities.
As a matter of fact, there is. I’ve been considering a new work detail, maybe something in the kitchen.
[ On phone ] Did she say anything before you got there? To Jennifer?
That’s more than enough. You know what needs to be done.
There were before, not now. Not when she mentioned Katarina. Now Elizabeth will stop at nothing. Wherever we put Renard, she’ll be found, and she’ll talk. I’d do it myself if I could, but I can’t, and it must be done.
I don’t know where the hell Dell is. I’m gonna go wipe down his tables.
Play it again.
Someone identified me to the caller. We both know who and why.
No. And I hope I’m wrong, but she’s hunting for my past. And putting me here makes it more likely she’ll find it.
Try to identify the person on the tape. And please reach out to the Task Force. I have a case.
A serial blackmailer. He takes his name from the villain in Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Purloined Letter.” However, unlike his namesake, this man’s never been identified.
Because I’m innocent. And he can prove it.
The explanation will be obvious once you’ve found him. But as my trial begins within the hour, I’d appreciate it if you would investigate now and ask questions later.
Yes.
Someone I trusted. As is the traitor who turned me in to the police.
Someone close. Traitors always are.
As you’re kind enough to inquire, I do have an issue that compels me to ask for a continuance.
A key piece of evidence has not yet materialized. I expect it to shortly. I have investigators working to locate it as we speak.
My cooperation agreement continues on a voluntary basis. I’ve steered the Bureau in the direction of a wanton criminal. Mr. Sima may not appreciate that an ancillary benefit of catching said criminal is that he is in possession of information that will prove my innocence, but anyone with an actual interest in the truth would, I’m sure, see a continuance as a prerequisite for a just outcome.
Yes. As any innocent man would.
 Your Honor, I’m happy to stipulate that Agent Ressler was the FBI agent who spent the prime years of his career engaged in a futile game of whack-a-mole.
Agent Ressler. My goodness. After all these years, I feel as if we actually know each other.
Have you ever heard of Katarina Rostova?
Would it surprise you to learn that she and I had quite a complicated history? Sex, drugs, rock ‘n’ roll. Did I say “sex”? Sex.
How about that Katarina hid the fact that she was a KGB agent, stole the coordinates for the submarine U.S.S. Gideon, and passed them on to her superiors? That she, in fact, was responsible for the deaths of those brave young men?
Agent Ressler, was I a good intelligence officer?
Sorry? Raymond Reddington was?
Hated by the KGB?
Would they have liked to see him disgraced?
Enough to forge a communiqué?
Mr. Sima asked you if I was a traitor. You hesitated with your answer. Why?
Is it because you’re uncertain? Or aware of mitigating circumstances that have given you a different opinion of me? About who I am today as opposed to who I once was?
Oh, but I do.
He hesitated for a reason.
There’s something else.
I need more time.
I would object, but I so enjoy a good yarn.
Was the withdrawal made in person?
You said the withdrawal required fingerprints and a password.
So if someone had a copy of my fingerprints and knew the password, they could have made the withdrawal, and no one at the bank, nor yourself, would have known the difference?
Yes. You know what else is possible? That I was framed by Katarina Rostova, which I could prove if Your Honor would grant me even the shortest–
I’m innocent. How can trying to prove that suggest incompetence?
Harold.
If you found his archives, I need the tape of a phone call he recorded on December 7, 1990.
If that was my plan, I wouldn’t need your help. I’m quite capable of bribing jurors on my own. I didn’t give you this case to get an acquittal.
To prove my innocence.
I do.
35 years ago, a Naval intelligence officer working for the U.S. government fell— fell into a relationship with a beautiful Russian woman. Unbeknownst to his superiors, that relationship, which started as guarded attraction, quickly evolved into passion, which resulted in pregnancy.
I’m sorry. I misspoke. Thanks to me, the Cabal is no longer secret.
I’m sure they have a Wikipedia page if you care to look.
I do.
Yes. Though, for the life of me, I don’t understand what the rush is all about. Everyone seems so anxious to kill me. Makes you wonder. [ To Judge Wilkins ] Perhaps you could enlighten me over a cocktail after my acquittal which is inevitable now that the evidence has arrived.
It’s a tape recording.
Then let’s get Agent Ressler to hop on the stand, cross his heart, hope to die, and do just that.
Mm. [ To Sima ] That loud whooshing sound is the wind blowing out of your case.
Agent Ressler. Do you recognize the man’s voice on the audiotape?
And the woman? Agent Rostova?
Why did you bring me this tape?
Thank you, Agent Ressler. And may I say – you are both everything I dislike about the FBI and everything I admire about it? Nothing further, Your Honor.
Ahh.
No bail? I was looking forward to that cocktail.
 Don’t judge her too harshly.
She was between a rock and a hard place.
It’s easy to think that now. Back then – things were – complicated.
Well, now you know the truth.
You know that your parents loved you very much. And that’s the only truth that matters.
A Pyrrhic victory, I’m afraid. Like eating a salted caramel babka. Immensely satisfying in the moment, but it just might be what kills me in the end.
And?
Well, who told her to make the call?
You showed her a photograph?
Of Elizabeth?
And?
Ohh. [ SIGHS ] I was so sure. I was– [ SIGHS ] The thought that she’d betrayed me again – But she didn’t.
[ BREATHES SHARPLY ]
If the warden needs to talk, he can come find me. He knows where I am.
I have much larger concerns than Warden Macatee and his laundry crew. The government is more intent than ever to stick a needle in my arm for any number of other crimes I’ve committed. An eventuality I have no intention of waiting around for.
Yes. Which is why I’m leaving.
Yes.
It’s a seedling of an idea. It’s immature at this point, but we have two months to help it grow.
Not yet. But it will.
Yes. At Gene & Georgetti’s. I have an insatiable craving for their Beef en Brochette, or the Chicken alla Joe. Maybe both.
The judge calendared eight weeks for the trial. So, to be safe, make the reservation for the following week.
I’ll take care of the trial. You take care of what comes after.
My immunity agreement.
I’ve uncovered a conspiracy. One that I know is deadly and is aimed at the halls of power. But I don’t know why or when it’ll strike. And I won’t until you catch the man known as the Cryptobanker.
As Hippocrates believed, “desperate times call for desperate measures.”
Yes, well, one aphorism at a time.
Objection!
Your Honor–
–is this even remotely acceptable to you?
[ CHUCKLING ] Come on. They’re fitting me for a Snitch Jacket, so even their incompetence won’t save me. On the off chance they win, I die in prison. In the likely event they lose,
You also have a moral obligation not to.
[ SCOFFS ]
Co-conspirators? These people are brave, honorable public servants. Mr. Sima may be content with a scorched-earth policy that would burn them in order to burn me. I can only hope that you’re not.
There’s been a change of plans. I’m moving up the timeline of my impending escape.
Thursday at 4:00.
–At 4:00.
I said we had eight weeks. Now we don’t. The government has changed its strategy, so I’m changing mine.
Vontae, I have until tomorrow. At 4:00. Here’s a “honeydo” list to do while I’m in court.
What about the warden?
Oh, he’s gonna do much more than that.
Let’s start with the items on the list.
To petition the court not to let Mr. Sima put the Task Force on trial.
Very well. Then I must. I’ll plead guilty. On all counts. But only if Mr. Sima agrees to instruct the jury that he was mistaken about the existence of an immunity agreement.
Yes. It plays to your strengths.
It is.
I do.
I am.
Other than Mr. Sima? No.
Yes, Your Honor, I’m sure.
Harold is an eternal optimist.
You don’t have to worry about me.
[ BREATHES SHARPLY, smiles sphinxlike ]
Apparently I’m a moral scourge and a malignant tumor.
No.
It won’t change the outcome.
Uh-ah– Fine. Short and to the point.
Gene & Georgetti’s would be nice. I’ve decided to go with the double lamb chops instead of the Beef en Brochette, and definitely the Chicken alla Joe.
Agent Keen, you’re a criminal profiler, are you not?
Top of your class at Quantico?
You’ve been trained to think like a criminal.
Profile me.
So off with his head! – Mine, not his.
Yes, but as I plan to echo what Mr. Sima says, I thought we might skip over him saying it.
I do. One trait of mine that Agent Keen’s otherwise exquisite profile left out was optimism. Hope for a better tomorrow. A desert safari on the Wahiba Sands. Riding with the bagualeros in Patagonia. None of that would be possible if I were sentenced to life in prison. There’d be nothing to hope for, and without hope, nothing to live for. Not even the joy of interrupting Mr. Sima to make his point, only pithier. As we’re all agreed I should be executed, I feel like we should wrap this up, don’t you? 
Yes. I had a thought or two.
That’s quite an animal you’ve got there.
Reminds me of a pooch that lived down the block when I was a kid. Always hot and cold. Wet kisses one day, stitches the next.
I’ve heard you’re in couples therapy. That must be quite an undertaking.
Well, for starters, two inmates will be critical to these negotiations – Vontae Jones and Vega Montero.
But they both have worked there in the past, they have a perceptive yet pragmatic take on the issues, and both are trusted by all parties concerned. I think we should bring them in on this.
 Come on, Jim. You asked for my help. It’ll take – what? 10 minutes? To prevent a laundry strike?
My goodness, look at that pronghorn.
Boy, that’s a beaut.
[ Over intercom, sounding like Macatee ] [ DISTORTED ] Send ’em in.
High as a kite. We only have about 10 minutes if this is gonna work. Where’s the hair and the glue? 
Someone needs to strip the warden.
Any takers? 
It’ll work. Most people aren’t particularly observant. They tend to see what they want to see. With the hat and the glasses, it’ll work.
I don’t need to get past 28 guards. I only need to get past two or three.
[ Mimicing Macatee ] On my way.
[ Louder ] I said I’m on my way. Could- Could you grab me a Yoo-hoo from the machine? My blood sugar.
Handcuff yourselves to the bars on the window. Tell them I threatened your lives, forced you to cooperate.
How do I look? Don’t answer that. [ To the dog ] All right, come on, Duke. Time to wake up. Let’s go, kid.
[ To Duke the dog ] You stay. You stay.
[ Over his phone ] Dembe, I’m 10 seconds out.
You need to abort now. They’ll fire on you!
No. Go! Go!
Tell me about the Cryptobanker.
He did business in Cairo with a man who can unlock the conspiracy.
Dembe photographed a transaction report between them. Get it. Show it to him. Get him to tell you where he sent the laundered money. An account number. An address.
Everything rests on finding him.
What you said in your profile. It was very kind.
Your Honor, I ask you to set the jury’s recommendation aside.
 A moment of madness.
Without hope, one is hopeless.
Thank you for coming, Harold.
I’ll know in a few hours. They’re giving me a physical to make sure I’m healthy enough to be killed.
He won’t.
For now.
Well, it’s scheduled for then. But it won’t happen if you do exactly as I suggest.
Good. Because it’s gonna require you to steal account information from a bank in Luxembourg.
[ LAUGHING ] Don’t look so sour. At this time of year, the valleys of the Black Ernz are just beautiful. Elizabeth will tell you the why. You’ll have to figure out the how or this will be goodbye.
Oh, cabbage soup and dressed herring. For my final meal. My mother loved cabbage soup and dressed herring.
I’ve made arrangements to be cremated, have my ashes placed into Mama Lu’s opium pipes.
The users won’t mind, and on the off chance there is an afterlife, I’d like to be high in it.
Yes, but not at an ending like this. Ah.
Within 24 hours, the president of Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service will be assassinated on U.S. soil.
A member of her advance team, Jonas Kruger, had $5 million wired to his numbered account.
The assassin.
I would. Of course, that also includes telling the truth.
I do. And how to stop him. Information I’ll gladly share as soon as the President grants me clemency and my immunity agreement is reinstated.
Do you want me to save her life?
If I stop it before getting a reprieve, I won’t get one.
Harold’s the best.
He’ll certainly try, but it won’t be enough to save Ava Ziegler’s life.
I rarely dislike a person before being introduced to them, but in your case, I’m afraid I’m going to have to make an exception. Who are you, anyway?
It appears you have unexpectedly formidable opposition.
If you want absolution, you have it. I meant what I said, Harold. You are the best as an agent and a person and a friend.
And why are you doing this?
To the drugs you’re gonna use to kill me.
[ Fiercely ] When I kill a man, I don’t pretend I care how he feels. I’ve shot them, stabbed them, suffocated them, but I’ve never coddled them. It’s disrespectful. So stop coddling me.
I’m sorry about before. I realize you’re just following protocol. It’s your job, after all. It’s a heavy burden killing a man. Most people can’t.
Elizabeth!
Excellent! Make it a table for two.
You’re going to be phenomenally wealthy.
You’ll be able to live anywhere you want. You’ll be able to do anything you want.
Ah, my final meal. I can’t think of anyone I’d rather share it with.
And I’m trying to tell you I’m okay if it is. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] 
[ LAUGHS ]
My mother made it for me when I was a child.
I was a difficult child. People saw me one way – I saw myself another. I felt misunderstood – acted out. My father fancied himself a disciplinarian. Very moralistic. Instead of trying to understand me, he excommunicated me.
My mother- My m- My mother- My mother understood.
My mother understood the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself. So she understood Everything. I’ve taught you to think like a criminal. I should’ve taught you to think like her. I-I should’ve learned to think like her. All those years spent worrying about you – fancying myself your guardian angel. She would’ve taken one look at you and known you’d be fine. And not because of the money I obsessively cobbled together for you but because you have in your life the only thing that matters – people who love you –
– people you can depend on – people who will always tell you the truth. Six years ago, I turned myself in because of you. Now, here, at the end, I’m at peace because of them.
You wanted to ask me something.
[ LAUGHING ] It’s terrible, isn’t it?
[ LAUGHING ] You’re right. Everything we had growing up was either over-boiled or under-cured.
[ LAUGHS ]
Let it go.
Elizabeth, let it go.
It’s too late for Ziegler. You’ll need to focus on the larger conspiracy.
He did everything he could. That’s- That’s more than enough for me. I should change.
I’m fine. Thank you for asking.
Right.
I’ll save my words for the next life.
Please tell me someone’s gonna answer that.
Harold. Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes.
Yes. Like my first STD.
Has that understanding been memorialized in writing?
If Harold is satisfied with the language, we can proceed.
[ LAUGHS ]
As long as I’m not left alone in a room with you, I’ll be fine.
Thank you, Harold. 48 hours is ample.
It was pubic lice. Crabs. Caught them on Hammamet Beach in Tunisia. She was a Vassar girl traveling with a bunch of pals from the French house. Two years after graduation, and they were still making up for lost time. My God. What a weekend. But like you, they get right in there and feast away without mercy until you want to douse the whole area with kerosene and set the little varmints on fire. Sorry. You and the crabs, not the Vassar girls.
You’ve been genuinely hospitable, but I sincerely hope we never meet again.
People make their own luck, some more than others.  I make a prodigious amount.
The President wants an assassin found. I know how to find him.
[ LAUGHS ]
Who?
Ah! I have no idea.
I said what I had to to survive. Is it just me, or is this an absolutely spectacular night?
None whatsoever.
Ahh. [ CHUCKLES ] I suppose we should start looking.
I didn’t cheat death. I cheated the President.
Thank you for everything, Harold.
I exaggerated.
The Corsican is the last piece of a very complicated puzzle.
The very same.
As I said, he is the last piece of the puzzle. We’ve already gotten all the other pieces. I’m quite confident we’ll get him.
Yes. You have been instrumental in putting it together. After all, I was in prison. Except when I wasn’t.
Indeed. One of Moreau’s few known associates was there. Mad as a hatter, but I had reason to hope that if Moreau were planning something big, the madman might have a lead to follow.
Yes. Dr. Nikkila.
After you got the good doctor in custody, Dembe discovered that he’d sent an ampule of his toxic bug juice to Moreau in London. Armed with the address, Dembe broke into his flat and found that Moreau had wired $5 million – to Axion Cryptosolutions.
God, no. All I knew was that, without an immunity agreement, I would have to leverage my way to freedom. Luckily, that’s exactly what this conspiracy provided.
I don’t know. And Moreau has the irksome habit of killing anyone who does.
Him! That’s him. Christopher Miles.
Former MI6. If there is a dossier, he’s precisely the kind of intelligence officer who would compile it. But he’s very discreet. If we’re going to get to him, we’re going to need some help.
He got throat cancer from oral sex.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Most people get it from smoking. He got it from cunnilingus.
Christopher Miles. Where might we find him?
You must be Marty’s wife. He spoke of you so often during our time together in Greece.
Please excuse us.
You did speak of her. Or mentioned her. Over coffee that last day. Given the way you chewed through Mykonos, I’m surprised you don’t have throat cancer.
Information. That’s all.
Mm. I mean him no harm. But as my resurrection depends on my finding him, I’ll harm anyone who stands in my way.
Dembe.
Sorry to break things up, pal.
Elizabeth, Christopher Miles works out of an address near Columbia Heights. Dembe is sending it to you now.
[ To Dembe ] 35 hours and counting. I’d say things are going quite well. We should celebrate, yes? [ CHUCKLES ] 
Yes. Some more deviled eggs and another Manhattan. I thought one would suffice, but we’re celebrating, and I definitely need another if I’m to get the job done.
Elizabeth.
And the dossier?
Did he give her the password?
Foxglove. [ He writes it down ]
Do you like magic? I love magic. Card tricks, coin tricks, close-up magic. Even those guys with the tigers. I heard they trained their cubs by masturbating them. Is that even conceivable? I’m sure it’s just a vicious rumor. But talk about a commitment to one’s craft. A tiger? Quite a handful.
You. You’re the tiger. A wild creature someone is trying to stroke. A magic trick is a con, and you’re the mark in the middle of a very complicated one. And the only reason I’m still alive is because you know it. You could have tracked me down anywhere. In a dark alley, in the bathtub. Instead, you came here, to a public place. Why? Because you know you’re being had.
Let’s start with how you found me. You were given access to the signal from my ankle monitor.
You tell me.
Pick a card, any card.
I don’t. But I can show you how the trick works, which is why she wants you to kill me.
I know her as Anna McMahon. Red hair, green eyes, no heart. The magician who made you think you were furthering your agenda when, in fact, you were furthering hers.
And Christopher Miles?
And his dossier?
I know you haven’t read it, because you can’t decrypt it. But I can.
You think a terrorist group hired you to kill Ava Ziegler because she uncovered a plot to resurrect German nationalism. I think someone in the US government hired you to kill her because she uncovered a plot against this country. But there’s only one way to know for sure.
I never like to know how a magic trick works. Spoils everything.
For you. How about returning the favor by letting me read it?
Is it sexual assault with a tiger? Apparently, one of the divine creatures thought so. Mauled one of those guys. Looks like Moreau might do the same.
Elizabeth.
I know his next target.
Anna McMahon.
Because she just sent him to kill me.
A tactical error she’ll pay for with her miserable life, unless you roll out or scurry on over or whatever it is you do.
And I’ll have plenty of time to explain it once he’s captured.
Well, that was a long three months.
I don’t know what the plot against this country is, but I do know she’s orchestrating it.
She sent Moreau after me because she thinks I know more than I do. As she could track me through my ankle monitor, I was unusually vulnerable. 
Fortunately, Moreau turned out to be a man of deep political conviction a nationalist who killed for that cause and that cause only. McMahon hired him under false pretenses. When I set him straight, he went to settle the score.
And you won’t get any. His killer has friends in high places.
As long as Anna McMahon is sniffing up our skirts, an abundance of caution will not be enough. If we’re gonna uncover the true nature of the conspiracy, we’ll have to engage in active disinformation.
Based on what? My word against hers? 
Yes. Well, thank you, Harold. Call me when you have a lead. I’m wheels up in 45.
I have no earthly idea. Anywhere but here. I’d forgotten how much this place reeks of stress and anxiety, deodorized body odor and old coffee.
Fabricio?
They need help in the back room. More servers. At least one. Maybe two.
And, also, let’s open another couple of cases of the Reserva. And, please, tell Amelia to keep the drinks flowing. Champagne, the wines, cocktails. I don’t care if they’re drinking milk – I don’t want an empty glass out there.
Oh, it’s good to be had.
Nolan! You made it! Thank you for coming.
[ LAUGHS ]
Not nearly as wonderful as your daughter’s beautiful wedding in Berlin. My head’s still throbbing.
Vivian, where’s your husband?
Thank goodness. Find me later. We have some catching up to do.
Teddy! ­
It’s much quieter on the veranda.
The balcony. It’s much quieter outside.
Sidney.
Funny thing, that. She asked me to introduce her to you.
Heddie! Would you be a dear and introduce Vontae to your young waitress friend?
[ CHUCKLES ] Honestly, Roger, I lost count at a baker’s dozen. Give my regards to the captain.
Good to see you guys.
Oh, dear. What’s wrong?
Eh. It’s behind us.
Thank you for coming, Glen.
Dembe. Did you find it?
And?
What? That can’t be.
Put it on the jet. Bring it here. I want confirmation.
Yes. And hurry home, Dembe. Heddie’s dying for a dance. [ CHUCKLES ] 
Walt Whitman lived in a boarding house at this address during the Civil War. Did you know he was an ardent prohibitionist? Imagine that – a sober poet. [ SLURPS ] Mmm! Have I ever told you about my mentor?
Is it early? I thought it was late. Robert Vesco. Robert took me under his wing. He taught me how to be a fugitive. I trusted him with my life and my life’s savings. Which he convinced me to invest in a cattle ranch in Paraguay. Or so I thought, until I went down there and found out it was a whorehouse just outside of Asunción.
Because Vesco up and died on me. 
Robert.
You look awfully good for a dead man.
Where the hell’s my money?
I trusted you. You were my mentor.
Robert. My money.
I know why you’re living there – you found the De La Cruz. The treasure. Where is it?
“Changed.”
Oh, my God.
Robert, you conned me once. I won’t be conned again.
I’m happy to. ­Right after I get the gold.
I already have inner peace. What I could use is a new yacht. The last one was seized in Mallorca.
To where?
Robert, if you’re lying, I will shatter your serenity by burning your home, drowning your cat, ­and cutting off your big toes.
[ CHUCKLES ] Maybe not. But I will take the toes.
Robert, I appreciate that your love of literature is almost as keen as mine, but why on Earth are we in the Library of Congress?
For something else catastrophic.
It didn’t sink. It was taken.
How can you be sure he was the one who took the galleon?
What a tale. An opera. A romance with pirates. A fire. Shipwrecks and gold. Just the sort of thing that gets me out of bed in the morning.
Oh, but you’re wrong. It will make me happy. Very. Dembe, phone Ruddiger. Tell him to sober up. We’re gonna rob the opera.
The audience?!
[ LAUGHS ] And why, pray tell, is that?
Next month? Be still my beating heart, next month.
Yes. And literally leading to an explosive crescendo.
I don’t think you truly appreciate my dedication to this project, so let me tell you exactly how this is going to play out. You and I are going to “The Barber of Seville” tomorrow night, and we’re not leaving until we have that treasure. So you better start studying that sheet music.
I’ll take care of everything else. You need munitions? My little German friend was born with a schnapps in one hand and a detonator in the other.
I’ll have him here in eight hours. You need vehicles? Drivers? I’ve got trucks. I’ve got guys. I’ve got women who can handle the guys. I’ve got people with faces so fresh, they’ll never see them coming. You need a distraction to get backstage? I’ve got a guy who can talk faster than a hot, buttered bullet. The truth is, Robert, my only real concern is you. Your attitude.
The pep in your step. The lust in your life. If we’re gonna pull this off, we need to get you right. You need to be your very best. We need to reawaken the old Robert Vesco, rediscover that dapper rascal whose charm and wit could deceive even the very best of us.
How do you feel?
Trust me, Robert, that feeling will pass the moment you hear the music. You’ll feel your heart pump again. You’ll feel truly alive. I’m sure of it. Franton, we’ll take two.
I hate to walk out on “Figaro’s Aria,” but I’ve seen it before. I’ll see it again.
Okay.That’s enough.
No more drinks. That’s it.
He’s drunk. We need to take him through the back.
It’s for Count Almaviva. Rolando, he’s come down with the flu.
Fascinating as this is, we need to get you to the Count now. He’s on in 10.
Ruddiger, what the hell’s going on?
­It’s a comedy!
Oh, dear God.
Okay, that’s it. Set the charges. Robert, give us a hand.
Glen! We have a situation.
We’re behind, and if we blow the charges late, we’re gonna have the police here in seconds. We need a distraction. Something loud. Really loud!
I don’t know, Glen! That’s why you’re here! You wanted a second chance! This is it! Figure it out! Think fast! Make some noise!
Blow it. Now‼️  [ BEEP ] [ BEEP, EXPLOSION 🔥💥🔥 ] 
Oh, my God.
[ CHUCKLES ] Now, there’s the twinkle in your eye I’ve been looking for! [ LAUGHS, claps ] 
Elizabeth. This isn’t a good time.
Did you enjoy the show?
We’ll be at Lulu’s enjoying their key lime pie. I’ll get your slice to go.
And now?
I have no intention of turning you in, Robert. And we’re certainly not going to Lulu’s. Place is bursting with tourists, and their pies are terrible. We’re gonna go find ourselves a nice, quiet cup of coffee somewhere.
Is it true that you introduced Nixon’s brother to Castro and then swindled them both into investing in a bogus drug trial?
[ LAUGHS ] Nixon and Castro! My God! It boggles the mind.
Where are the others?
Why don’t you join them?
That’s a great idea.
The airport, then. Tomorrow at 10:00. I’ll drop you wherever you want. I was filled with vengeance for so long, I never saw the gift you gave me in Asunción. I never trusted anyone easily after that. That’s why I’m still alive. I’m in your debt, my friend.
Change of plans.
[ Chuckles ] It was, wasn’t it? I was quite pleased with how it all came together.
No, he’s not. The treasure is.
Turns out, he’s reformed.
Sworn off greed and avarice.
Yes, and in honor of his ascetic existence, I’ve decided to hand over $100-something million worth of 18th-century gold.
Every last doubloon. It’s inside.
I’m in your debt, my friend.
Do you have a phone?
Come on. Take my picture. It’s not often I get egg on my face. But to be egged by the same person twice? That needs memorializing.
Waste of time? We’ve been decrypting legends. Chasing pirates. Hunting hidden treasure.
How can you lose something you never had? I gave you a Blacklister you thought was dead. Now that you know he’s alive, you can hunt him down. Plus, you witnessed my humiliation. I think that would salve any wound.
Get in here, Dembe. I see a little yolk on your cheek. [ SIGHS ]
Ahh.
Where is he on the clinical trials?
They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. [ GROANS ] They’re wrong.
Your mother loved that photograph. Represented everything she wanted but couldn’t have. Not after she betrayed the KGB. After that, she was a hunted woman.
Hunted by the Osterman Umbrella Company.
A burn notice can mean kill or capture. When it’s kill, they’re the hit squad of choice.
The KGB. The CIA. MI6. SID. Over the years, most agencies have come to the conclusion that terminating their own was bad for business. It strained loyalties, created tension within the ranks. Where most agencies agree on nothing else, this they agree on – that a neutral third party is critical in the elimination of their own operatives.
Of their own agents, yes.
They did. Which is all the incentive I need to put them on the Blacklist, but as the FBI may need a bit more bait on the hook, there is this – typically, the Umbrella Company operates on foreign soil, but I’ve been led to believe their next target is here in the United States.
I want to know the name of the American agent you’re targeting. And why.
The name.
This would all be much more pleasant if you’d give me a name.
A lexical ambiguity. The agent may not be American, but he is being targeted here. Who?
No? Nothing?
Hm.
To visit a friend.
Thank you, Teddy. Lunch after?
Rain check, then! [ To chinchillas ] Okay, guys.
[ RED LAUGHS ] [ CHUCKLING ] Yes. Yes.
Ohh.
[ CHUCKLING ] Well, you look touched to me. Squeezed. Snug, really. Funny word, “snug.” Comes from the German “snöggr,” meaning shipshape, prepared for bad weather. Are you prepared for bad weather, Mr. Hobbs? Because from the look of things, you’re in for a terrible storm.
I’m told Betsy there has a weakness for chinchilla appetizer. Mine is Gougères Gruyère cheese puffs. If there’s a tray within a nautical mile, I won’t make it to the main course. Unfortunately for you, these little guys are far too cute to be served up as a starter. And what with Brimley’s congestive heart failure, diabetes, and asthma, the chances are slim to none that he’ll be back with a goat before Betsy there swallows you whole. So – a name.
I didn’t get the name, but I got the address where you can find it.
When did you hear from her last?
We would have heard something.
The Mossad comes to mind.
The more pressing question is whether her assailants can be called off in time to make a case for her life.
Elizabeth, all that matters is that you find Samar right away.
I’m gonna pay a visit to an acquaintance of mine from Tel Aviv.
Recognize that?
Your driver is relaxing in the footwell of my Mercedes with a gun barrel in his mouth. So – tell me about the chess piece.
That a contract’s been taken out on Samar.
Call it off.
Call the Umbrella Company and cancel the contract.
Is it done?
“Target.” How conveniently impersonal.
The only condition that would justify what you’ve done is if she were a traitor. She isn’t.
How can you possibly know that? 
If she’s dead, you’re next.
Yes, you did.
An(!) assassin’s dead. There’ll be more. Samar knows that.
Agent Navabi has vascular dementia.
From her near-drowning. Her brain was deprived of oxygen.
Well, the truth is, she didn’t. Not fully.
Because it’s irreversible. Samar has top-level security clearance. Today, she knows how to keep a secret, but someday, she won’t.
The only person with the authority to call off the contract is the Mossad’s D.C. Station Chief.
They’re trying to kill Samar because she’s sick. She knew they would. That’s why she kept it a secret.
I’m not much of a company man. Conformity doesn’t interest me. There’s profit in it. And power. But no soul. The company man is rewarded for following the rules. The better the company man, the less it matters what the rules are, how ethical they are, how just, how humane. In your company, the rules called for you to kill a good and decent person, a colleague and partner. And you followed those rules blindly and without question.
Which only proves my point – that the company can corrupt even the best among us.
And yet you did it anyway.
No, I don’t believe we do. What I really can’t get is how you used Agent Mojtabai, how you manipulated him into telling you about Samar’s condition. He told you so as to protect her, but because of you, he has to live with the fact that he betrayed her, that his words put a target on her back, that he is the reason that they will never be together again. Aram trusted you, and because of that trust, his life has been devastated.
Yes. And I suppose I’m just doing mine.
Samar isn’t coming.
Samar has new papers, different place to go.
I’ll see to it she’s well cared for. You have my word.
This is what she wants.
For what it’s worth, I tried to talk her out of it.
She knew you’d insist. [ CELLPHONE OPENS ] Just hit “redial.” She’s waiting for your call.
I’m sorry, Aram.
Just hold on one sec.
Because Gary Cooper or Henry Fonda or Gregory Peck have taught us that’s how a man should deal with a problem.
I have a competitor I want you to take out of the competition.
Only time will mend Aram’s broken heart. Or revenge.
The chief is not my competition. Nor is he honest. He used to work for one cartel. Now he works for a more powerful one. My competition is the woman who convinced him to switch sides.
She helps them expand. By identifying targets. Organizations vulnerable to hostile takeovers – businesses or individuals whose debt can be leveraged, or, in this case, a cop who’s susceptible to persuasion.
[ CHUCKLES ] Corporate CEOs are slavishly beholden to quarterly earnings, often sacrificing long-term strategy for short-term gain. Well, CEOs of criminal enterprises may not have Wall Street analysts to answer to, but they’re still under the gun to increase profits because if they don’t, they’re not given a golden parachute and exiled to a mansion in the Hamptons, they’re killed. So pointing them to greener pastures is a very lucrative business and no one is better at it than Olivia Olson.
Because it’s a win-win. I get to expand my reach, and you get to know more about what Anna McMahon has been up to.
As I said, it’s a win-win.
I’ve never made a virtual acquaintance. I must say, it feels – pornographic.
You convince people to change allegiances. I’m hoping to convince you to do the same. I’ll make it worth your while.
Well, I guess we’ll see.
Anna McMahon.
The NAFTA renegotiation. When the treaty went for Senate confirmation, the White House was one vote shy. Anna McMahon asked you to get it for them, and you did.
And you underestimate mine. You’re not the only one capable of drawing a heat map.
More of a successor, really. You’ve had a nice, long run. I’d hope to honor that by informing you of my hostile takeover in person. But perhaps this is best. Face to face, those conversations can linger uncomfortably. This way, we can simply disconnect.
Aram.
It will get better.
Why is that? I led you by the hand to an elusive Blacklister, [ CHUCKLES ] and you let her get away.
I omitted it. Hiding implies I cared one way or another about you knowing. I didn’t.
I certainly hope so.
Harold, sit. Take a breath. Smoke a cigar. Read some “Calvin and Hobbes.” Whatever you do to relax, do it before you have an aneurysm.
Anna McMahon is smart and cautious, and, try as we might, neither you nor I have been able to get the merest whiff of her plot against this country. I thought it best to force the issue. Let her know we’re looking, put her on alert, make her think twice, and in doing that, possibly, hopefully, cause her to make a mistake.
Sometimes my grasp of human nature astonishes even me.
Olivia Olson.
You don’t know her?
She facilitates mergers and acquisitions for criminal clients across four continents.
Patience, Harold. We’re chumming the waters. Sooner or later, the big one will bite.
You’ve made a terrible mistake, Aram.
A mistake you’ll have to rectify.
I want my money.
Is this your idea of vengeance?
No matter what happens next, this doesn’t end the way you think it’s going to.
Elizabeth.
Who’s the target?
Have you reached out to Aram?
That was Elizabeth. She doesn’t know you’re gone. You didn’t say goodbye.
[ Drinks ] Mm. Ahh. [ INHALES SHARPLY ] It’s hard to leave people you care about. Or maybe you didn’t say goodbye because you don’t think that’s what this is. And if that’s the case, let me be clear – If you become part of Samar’s new life, Harold, Donald, Elizabeth – you’ll never be able to see them again. Never speak to them. Never be there for them when they need you.
You running away will not take Samar off the Mossad’s kill list. They’re counting on you to lead them to her – which is why they bugged your apartment, phones, friends.
Because that’s what I would do. It’s why Dembe took an extra hour to get us to the jet – shake off any possible tail. From now on, Aram, you call a friend or family, text, e-mail, insta-whatever, anything – they will trace it to you, find Samar, – and kill her. And yes. The Task Force needs help. To stop an imminent attack.
Doesn’t matter. You’re out. Sit back, relax – calculate the hourly interest you’re accruing on my $60 million.
[ GROANS ]
[ GRUNTS ] Mm.
You’re either in or you’re out.
At 4%.
Yes. [ GRUNTS ] And mine is 25.
Which makes the hourly interest [ Squints ] $1,700 – and $12.
I’ll round it down to $1,700 – Friends and family discount.
[ Loudly ] The target you’re trying to identify, we believe it may be in Manhattan.
[ Looks at his watch ] Another hour in purgatory.
Why don’t we just wait and see?
Samar accepted it. She engineered it.
I’ve made many difficult choices in my life. Choices that at one point or another have brought pain and sorrow to everyone I cared about. That’s a heavy burden to bear, even if the path one chooses is the only one in sight. It’s the burden Samar now bears. She didn’t leave because she thought you would come to resent her. She left because she saw no other path. She’s a target. And if she was in your life, you’d be a target, too. So she left. Allow her to believe she did the right thing. If you go to her, she’ll just have to leave you again. Don’t make her burden heavier than she can bear.
And yet she didn’t have the strength to say goodbye to you. You are more powerful than you know, Aram. Use it wisely.
Any chance she knew you’d made copies before giving her the hard drive?
[ Reads ] “The Third Estate.”
Yes. It’s a reference to the French Revolution. It means “everyone else.” The 99%. It also means McMahon used Olson to pressure the Third Estate into helping McMahon carry out her plot against the United States. You have your first lead, Harold. Congratulations, and you’re welcome.
It’s a reference to the French Revolution. It means “everyone else.” The 99%. It also means McMahon used Olson to pressure the Third Estate into helping McMahon carry out her plot against the United States.
[ WHISTLES ] Hey! Guys, come on. Guys. Let’s just simmer down.
What’s the problem here?
[ LAUGHS ] What are they fighting about?
Who was in charge of the manifest?
The one with the gambling habit?
 Didn’t we square his debt, get him some kind of help or something? Where the hell is he?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Oh. All right. Hey, hey. Come on. Come on, come on. Guys, put the guns away. Put the guns away. Come on. It’s just a bunch of TVs. [ LAUGHS ] There’s plenty more where they came from. Dembe, let’s see if we can’t drum up a few bottles of arak.
Yeah, there we go. All right.
Thank you, boys. Thanks, guys. There really is no misunderstanding that a bottle of arak can’t cut through.
[ On phone ] Henry. Five Albanians and four Nigerians walk into a shipping depot. There is no punch line. Where the hell are you?
You were gambling today?
What are you talking about? Who came to you? I needed you here.
I’m afraid our friend Henry was paid a little visit by Lady Luck.
Thank you, Smokey. You can give the addresses to Dembe. He’ll alert the unfortunate guests.
While I was in prison, certain people in my organization took it upon themselves to do a little freelancing. Others attempted to move against me. In the time since that regrettable chapter ended, I’ve determined who the Benedict Arnolds are and will be confronting them about it at the locations you’ve secured.
I’m sure you’re not really surprised by how few people I can trust.
That means more than you know, Smokey.
I’ll know when I see them. Ultimately, everyone’s fate is negotiable. Except the person who turned me in. Whoever they are, their fate is sealed.
Elizabeth! A warm light in an otherwise dark and gloomy day.
Going. On a West Coast swing to Los Angeles. We have a few stops along the way, so I’m a bit pressed for time. [ Motions to Smokey to leave ] If you don’t mind –
I’m sorry to rush to the point, but I need your help. An associate has had a sudden and startling stroke of good fortune.
Imagine gambling away your mortgage, facing financial ruin because you’re addicted to chance. And then imagine, in that moment of anguish and desperation, you’re offered salvation – erase your debt, keep a roof over your family’s head. Would you take it?
No catch. A bet. On yourself. A dance with Lady Luck.
Is that why you took advantage?
Pepper?
Carlo, I didn’t bring you here because you stepped out while I was otherwise engaged. You’re here because I want to know whether you were simply pressing your advantage or whether you were the one who created the advantage in the first place.
I’m gonna ask you one time, and I want a simple yes or no. Did you turn me in to the police?
[ Pause ] 10 percent. Going forward, you’re gonna need to kick in an extra 10 percent. A tax for underestimating me.
You know what, Carlo? You’re right. Make it 15%. Any objections?
Martin Walcott. Do you know him?
On the contrary. He recorded record profits.
Martin Walcott, Smokey Putnam.
Smokey used to run with the circus. Handled logistics. Trains in, trains out. I’m surprised the two of you haven’t crossed paths. I’m just a sideshow for Martin. He’s a senior VP at a railroad that runs freight between New Mexico and Illinois.
Let me ask you something, Martin, and I want a simple yes or no.
Did you turn me in to the police?
Because that’s an awfully big number. And the only way you could’ve hit it was if I was in prison.
Did you? I don’t think so. If you thought I’d be pleased, the book would reflect how you hit the number. But it doesn’t do that, does it? It’s a big number because you cut a deal with the Catela Cartel to run methamphetamine. You used my network, my trucks, my drivers, my warehouses.
[ CHUCKLES ] I’m not in the methamphetamine business. It’s a poison. You traded on my name. I’m a relatively forgiving man. But that – that, I can’t forgive.
[ To Smokey ] What do you think?
Yeah. What do you think I should do with Martin? I’m curious.
You said, “On the one hand.” Is there another?
G. Gordon Liddy was an architect of the Watergate break-in. A strident true-believer who trained himself to be unemotional about doing terrible things. He’d literally test himself by fire.
Holding his hand over a flame without flinching as his flesh burned. People thought it was a trick. He said the trick is not minding.
Ahh. [ INHALES SHARPLY ] I mind. [ BLOWING ] I mind. [ BLOWING ]
[ Drinks ] Mmm.
You said you’d never met Martin Walcott.
If you never met him, how’d you know he had children?
Stop. The only thing worse than a lie is the lie that compounds it.
In plain English. I don’t want to miss a word.
Androssani was just trying to make his rate. I don’t condone it, hence the 15% surcharge. Walcott came up with the idea to use my infrastructure to move drugs. Which was bad enough, but what you did was considerably worse. You made his idea happen. You were the logistical mastermind. Without you, his idea was just that – an idea. Thanks to you, it’s now a reality.
I know about the network, Smokey. The shipments of meth you’re making to Phoenix, Miami, Seattle, Boston, and everywhere along the way.
What I think is that you’re a born carny. You’re a con man. You’re simply hard-wired to help yourself at the expense of others. Friends, addicts, enemies, even me. In my absence, you built a network that ships meth coast-to-coast. That’s impressive. Offensive.
Dembe doesn’t make this decision.
Have you ever had a flying dream?
A dream in which you suddenly have the power of flight. Unburdened by the weight of apprehension and doubt, you suddenly find you can fly. It’s a dream of freedom and bliss. The opposite of a falling dream, which, of course, is a dream of fear and anxiety, panic. Flying is life. Falling is death.
What? 
An example had to be made.
Hey! [ LAUGHS ]
Of course! We wouldn’t miss it! Ahh.
Look at you, Janet.
I’ve never been thanked for exiling someone before.
It’s the least I could do for keeping my relationship with the task force secret.
Thank you, Janet.
Imagine that!
Someone betrayed me. Someone turned me in to the police.
No. But anyone who may know who did, I want them to come forward and tell me before more people die.
If you knew the truth, would you come forward to stop me from taking a life?
Well, then. I can only hope that anyone who actually knows is as principled as you.
Please, come in.
I have a lead –
– The Third Estate –
I know why they procured the surveillance equipment to help them breach security systems favored by the aristocrac– Are you listening?
Dembe and I are having a bit of a disagreement over methodology. He thinks I’m being heavy-handed.
Finding the person who turned me in to the police. He’s been unusually oppositional. I suggested he take some time to more thoroughly reflect on my way of thinking.
A top advisor to the President is orchestrating a plot against your country. She’s engaged the Third Estate to help her. Why? And who are they? During the French Revolution, they were the 99%. Their goal was to behead the 1% in order to create a more perfect union. Sound familiar?
Tell that to the billionaires whose children the Third Estate has abducted from their homes.
Five abductions in the past 18 months, ransomed for hundreds of millions of dollars.
Or perhaps it’s a way to finance something more diabolical. Either way, it’s a symptom of where the world is right now, the rage of the many against the few.
Both are indomitable.
Well, that’d be perfectly awkward. I almost wish I could be there to see the expression on her face when she finds out.
Oh my, yes. I know just the person. Marie Mortel. Thumbscrews. Iron spiders. The occasional Judas Cradle. What’s your fancy?
Gladly. I’ve been meaning to pay her a visit.
Yes. Often quite voluntarily.
Dembe. How are we?
I don’t expect you to like it all. And you can leave at any time. But if you stay, I need to know I can count on you.
Yes. Good. I want you to set a meeting with Maxwell Ruddiger. Very few people knew I was in New York on the day I was arrested. He was one. He was there. So, please, call Ruddiger.
I have no plan one way or another.
Ah!
Oh, my goodness! A holy nail.
Marie, you’ve outdone yourself.
I didn’t. But whatever object does lay me low, I’d be honored if it ended up in your collection.
I’m wondering if you can help us locate – this, an ancient device resurrected to inflict contemporary pain.
Help us find it, and I’ll make sure that happens.
Excuse me. We’re looking for Noel Gerrick.
Wouldn’t a racetrack be better suited to this sort of activity?
I’m Steve Homan. And you are?
So is cholera. I do hope you’re not the poor man’s girlfriend.
Well, aren’t you being a good sport.
Men my age don’t compensate. We do what we want. Youth compensates. With disrespect and poor taste.
Let’s say he’s doing about 100. The stopping distance will be around 600 feet. A flaccid, old man could never think that fast.
Perhaps your father has a bit more pep in his step than you think.
Scoot over, Noel. I’m driving.
I suspect you have an interest in history, Noel. Did you know, shortly before her date with the guillotine, Marie Antoinette had a chance to escape from France? But she just couldn’t bear to travel like a commoner. She insisted on a rosewood carriage lined in ivory, large enough for herself, three chambermaids, four footmen, and all of their luggage. The finished product was so decadent, it could only go about two miles per hour before breaking down altogether. Just imagine if this had been her getaway car. She could’ve settled in London and eaten cake for the next 50 years. Good golly. I haven’t moved this fast since my first date with Jenn Parsons at the roller rink.
Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana. The criminal code that sanctioned Marie’s beheading as well as judicial torture. The rack was a particularly gruesome tool in the Ancien Regime‘s torture kit. I understand you purchased one at auction.
A rather peculiar hobby I’d love to hear more about, but as I’m pressed for time, let’s focus on the rack. Who did you sell it to?
Is this vinyl?
Good. The blood will wipe right off.
A name.
Ahh. Where’s your collection? 
An address.
I took the liberty.
Anna McMahon.
Ohh, you’re too modest. You are the Third Estate. You got trust-fund babies to go on a kidnapping spree, and you kicked the ransom money to one of the most powerful figures in the United States government. I want to know why.
Refresh your memory? No?
How about now?
Last chance.
Anna McMahon. You can spill your guts or your brains. I’m good either way.
If there was, he would’ve told me.
Doesn’t appear so.
All we know for sure, Harold, is that Anna McMahon is a much worthier adversary than we thought. A fact which, much to my dismay, I find oddly arousing. Maybe it’s the red hair. [ Drinks Scotch ] Ahh.
Excellent! A silver lining at the end of a grimly overcast day. I was wrong about Anna McMahon. We’re no closer to identifying her plot than we were yesterday. But Ruddiger – I have a good feeling about him.
Elizabeth! [ CHUCKLES ] Sorry. I didn’t hear you come in. [ CLICKS ] I’m listening to a “podcast.” They’re these episodic audio recordings–
Digital is the province of hackers and prying eyes. My life depends on sticking to simpler pleasures. This one’s a compelling but misguided series called “Thaw.”
 Tobias Carlyle. Though, if the podcast is to be believed, Carlyle is in prison for crimes he didn’t commit.
Yes, and with the case about to go to the jury, this happens.
Carlyle went to prison six years ago. When he did, the murders stopped. It can’t be coincidence that they’ve started again.
Yes, or a contract killer, one working at Carlyle’s instruction.
None. Which is why I’m giving you the case. A serial killer is in prison. His associate is carrying on in his absence. Unless you catch him and prove his connection to Carlyle, the jury will overturn Carlyle’s conviction.
Keep me posted. It’s a busman’s holiday, but I’m a sucker for true-crime drama.
Why would I do that?
[ Shocked Pause ] [ To Dembe ] The homeless woman who called in the anonymous tip. You- You said you showed her a photo of Elizabeth. You said she didn’t recognize her.
No, it’s mine. I knew it was you as soon as I found out you were looking for Dr.
One day I’m captured, the next, you’re looking for someone who knows I was once someone else? I knew that wasn’t a coincidence, but I let my hopes convince me that – you’d never betray me like that.
That neither of you would.
That they’d put me on trial, – sentence me to death?–
–That surprised you?
And you think you deserve to know the truth.
That you’re entitled to that?
That entitlement justified risking my life?
And why is that?
[ BREATHES DEEPLY ] I’m not sure I’ll ever believe you again.
No, no, no, no. No.
I need some time to think.
I’m not confused. I’m not angry. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] I’m just tired.
You knew Elizabeth turned me in.
The difference is that you and I don’t have secrets.
She can wait.
[ Angrily ] What you do for me, what I depend on you to do, cannot be done if your loyalties are divided. The same could be said about me for you. I’ve trusted you with my life, with everything in my life. You are the person to whom I am most vulnerable. That makes you either a singular friend or a mortal enemy.
I know – I need time to think about that.
I got your message about the accident.
Yeah. Three months after it happened.
Car’s on life support, but you’re doing fine. What’s it gonna take to get rid of you?
I’m here to think.
Think. Not talk.
Lemme buy you a new car. This one’s not safe. Not surprised you got in an accident.
I’m thinking about excommunication.
Elizabeth and Dembe. She turned me in. He knew and said nothing about it.
I’ve never killed for more.
Yes.
I haven’t ever been totally forthright about myself.
She’s been looking and thought she’d have a better chance of finding out more if I was in prison and couldn’t interfere.
He did.
How about a new Mercedes or a pickup truck? You want a brand-new pickup truck?
Thank you.
A beer?
Which you find unforgivable.
Aside from my suggesting you get a new car?
You forgiving?
You forgave Katarina.
But not me.
Good luck with the car.
I know how to hurt people I care about. I came for advice on how to live with it.
[ SIGHS ] You gave up a lot.  That was hard. Sometimes, I forget how hard.
Why’d you do it? Why sacrifice so much that you end up like this?
If Katarina were standing here instead of me, if it were she asking you why you did what you did after she’d betrayed you, what would you tell her?
But if you could tell her–
But if you could –
It’s Elizabeth.
I’m sure she wants to know what I’m gonna do.
You didn’t.
The car.
The last time you saw Katarina was in the rearview mirror.
I’m not sure I know how to live with Dembe’s betrayal.
Are you at peace with the choice you made?
Going somewhere?
What is the “this” that our friendship has come to? Our friendship was born of suffering and desperation, trust and compassion. It grew in crisis and chaos, matured in curiosity and scholarship. Our life together has been peaceful simplicity. Our life together has been death-defying. I’m not sure if the right word is “friendship” or “love.” I just know it lives in me for as long as I live and, hopefully, longer. I went away to think about you and me, and all I could think was that I missed you. Us. You know, Elizabeth Keen has lied and deceived me more times than I can count, and I’ve forgiven her every time. But I realize you don’t need my forgiveness. Ever. Because when it comes to “this” [ Gestures back and forth between them ] you can do no wrong.
I guess I don’t understand.
Wh-Where are you going?
–After pondering that for a moment, replies, “It’s too early to tell.”
Elizabeth. To what do we owe the pleasure? I hope it’s a hankering for roast goose. Succulent doesn’t begin to des–
Take a look at the door.
You see Chuck?
You know who you don’t see? Dembe. You know why? Because your hunt for the truth – mine, by the way, not yours – cost me my relationship with him.
Who told you this?
You and me both.
I am what I am. Popeye the Sailor Man.
Was it worth the trip?
What were you thinking?
What did you tell her?
I know the broad strokes. I know who I am. I need to know the details of exactly what you’ve thrown out there into the ether.
Is that what you think you did? Because I think you may have made things worse. So, from the start what did you tell her, word for word?
Elizabeth.
I haven’t had a case for you until now.
I thought we covered everything we needed to.
Why?
This case has twins who aren’t twins. Child abduction. And a mysterious connection to Anna McMahon. Care to hear about it?
Conflicted.
I live and work by a very strict code built on loyalty, justice, trust. I survive because I eliminate those who betray it. Up until now, no one has been spared, not even my closest associates. Not even Kate Kaplan.
You can mock it because you live in a world with institutionalized codes, where order has already been imposed by powerful forces outside of yourself, where there are laws and rules for everything. I live in a world with no laws, no rules, and certainly no order. So I have to impose my own. I’m not conflicted about killing you. I’m conflicted because I can’t. Because I can neither kill nor trust nor forgive.
Dembe hid your misdeeds. Yours. Not his.
With a case. Until it’s solved, our conflict can wait.
Senator Christensen! I’m terribly sorry to interrupt. I know you’re very busy getting stroked here, but I only need a moment.
Yes. I’m looking for this man.
I’ve searched near and far, and it’s come to my attention he may be in your employ.
Who is he?
Senator, unlike your lunch date here, I’m not interested in foreplay. I’ve spoken with a number of sources who tell me the man in the photo is in the business of finding difficult-to-find items and is presently trying to find something for you.
No. I-I will take a martini. Dry. Two olives.
[ LOUDLY ] Actually, I find indiscretion often works to my advantage. Please. Go on.
How do I reach him?
What is the piece? Of art?
Ah! Vaisravana. Exquisite.
No, no, no. It’s for the Senator. He could use a good stiff drink.
Good afternoon. I have an item for your catalogue.
Fat Joe says you do more than that.
He told me to tell you there are moles in your garden.
Call the exterminator.
And this is a suitcase filled with $50,000 in unmarked bills for putting it in your catalogue.
There’s another suitcase for letting me use your back room to talk to the buyer.
Do you know who I am?
How many will it take for you to circulate the photo?
Four suitcases, no questions, and you throw in the mantle clock. I’m a sucker for Limoges.
No, you’re here for a little chat. Let’s hope the conversation is fruitful.
You do know this is a matter of some urgency, right?
Teddy, I need to know where he took the children and what he’s doing for Anna McMahon, and I need to know now.
Ah, here we go.
That’s all you’re saying.
[ CHUCKLES ] I didn’t fire him. In fact, I forgave him. And he doesn’t eat meat!
There’s a code of ethics! Why is that so difficult for people to understand?
Anything?
Try again.
Anna McMahon. I need to know what she’s instructed him to find.
Thank you, Teddy.
So?
Why did McMahon hire him?
I came because I have news. About Anna McMahon.
She hired Mr. Cotton to find the dossier. We thought she had it. She doesn’t.
Yes. A child. A random child that Bastien Moreau gave the dossier to in the moments before he was killed. A child who has no idea that they possess a detailed description of a plot against the United States.
He did. Just before I got to him. Which means she has a head start.
She’s gotten so big.
That’s not a code. It’s a greeting card.
Because you believe love wins?
If you’re asking whether it was a surprise that you became an FBI agent, the answer is no.
Sam did what I told him to. Will Scottie do the same for you?
She will if Agnes is to get what she needs.
Christopher Miles. Former MI6. If there is a dossier, he’s precisely the kind of intelligence officer who would compile it.
We thought she had the dossier. She doesn’t.
[ Groggily ] Elizabeth.
What you need is Jin to work your pressure points. Bronchitis. Asthma. Migraines. You’ve got a problem, reflexology will rub it right out of you. The man is a healer.
[ GROANS ] Hmm. [ SPEAKING MANDARIN CHINESE: ] Sadly, that’s all I have time for. [ SIGHS ]
So be it. But when my sinusitis flares up, I’m blaming you. Xiexie, Jin. [ Gets up, GROANS ] 
My friend.
Guess he’s still angry.
I admire her joie de vivre.
I hired Rogelio’s niece to work in my warehouse in Lisbon. Before she started, our margins were 18%. After, 13%.
Your angel slept with my foreman. And when his wife forced him to quit, she slept with his replacement.
[ SCOFFS ]
Me?! Her snogging cost me my entire management team!
Rogelio, I’m sorry.
We’re looking for a family who doesn’t want to be found.
I need you to circulate their photo to every maid, busboy, and janitor in your undocumented army. I’ll pay $20,000 to the person who locates them. $50,000 if they do so by dinner. Speaking of which, we passed a Bolivian food cart on our way here that serves the best tucumanas this side of Sucre. When you have news, that’s where we’ll be.
Mmm. A deep-fried pocket of heaven for your thoughts.
Your mother can’t hurt you.
I’m pretty sure I already apologized.
I am very sorry that I forgot what my father always told me: no good deed goes unpunished.
They’re being followed?
That’s what I’m doing, Harold.
Anna McMahon knows we’re after the dossier.
You all right?
Get everyone out of here.
After the dossier.
I lost them. Grimm and the dossier.
And his house is neat as a pin.
He’s not missing. He’s dead. They sent a cleaner.
Or he’s part of the conspiracy.
Realistic, Donald? Might I remind you I blackmailed your President over $300 million in illegal campaign contributions he took from a Russian oligarch over three years ago. The man has money, not sense.
Do that, and you show your hand.
Tell me something I don’t know, Harold.
Anything on the dossier yet?
[ Jovially ] Don’t you love the anticipation? The moment before the curtain goes up, wondering if the show will live up to all the hype and expectation.
Aww.
I never properly thanked you for making sure that didn’t happen.
Harold. You respect authority. You follow the chain of command. And yet you marched into the White House and ordered the President to stay my execution.
What you did wasn’t a desperate measure. It was an act of bravery and friendship. I can count on one hand the number of people to whom I owe my life. You are one of them. For that, I am forever grateful.
Remember when classified documents were classified documents, Harold? Typewritten on onion skin, mimeographed, and stamped “Top Secret” just like in the spy movies? That was fun. Simpler times, I suppose.
Gavrilo Princip, the Bosnian Serb who assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. That single act set into motion the chain of events that ignited the First World War.
So much for underwhelming.
See if the Third Estate pulled a permit to protest outside.
She doesn’t. But perhaps she wanted us to think she did.
The Third Estate are domestic terrorists dedicated to bringing down the rich and powerful.
Of course they will. They hate Diaz. McMahon needs a patsy. Who better to blame for decapitating the head of state than a group named after people who decapitated heads of state?
He took foreign money to get elected. If he did that, who knows what else he’s done. Maybe people found out, and the walls are closing in, and he prefers to go out as a martyr to the cause. Many presidents only live for their legacy. Whatever the reason, he’s carrying a heavy burden. People who kill themselves always are. Burdens they can’t imagine ever being able to cast off.
Your mother was not as bad as– I understand why you might think she was, but she wasn’t. She was a young woman trying to make sense of a world that was falling apart around her. She was on one side of an unbridgeable divide. Your father was on the other. And you were in between. Over the years, your mother’s legend has grown. Mythic spy. Bloodless turncoat.
There isn’t. Bring her home.
If you need me, I’ll be at Jin’s.
Nah. Sciatica.
I’m telling you, the man is a wizard.
What?
Elizabeth, what’s happening?
Wait – Elizabeth. Elizabeth!
Elizabeth.
You’ve gotten out of there before. You can do it again.
There’s nothing you can do for them right now.
Tell me what you need me to do.
Tadashi Ito.
I’ll try. [ CHUCKLES ] But my arrangement with Mariko is weekends only. What else?
Ruddiger? I am not sure he’s even in the country.
Elizabeth, slow down. If I’m going to involve Ruddiger, I need to know exactly what you’re planning.
Where the hell is everyone?
A work in progress? Ruddiger! We don’t have time! I was very clear–
Who’s this guy?
Does Jurgen work at the airport?
Ruddiger.
And this is them?
Who are these guys?
What? Wait. Five? The Shadow Five?
[ CHUCKLING ] Oh, my God! These guys robbed the Banco Central. How do you know them?
And they know what we’re doing?
Did it work?
Fantastic. I’m on my way to you now with Ruddiger and the boys. Tell the fellas we’re a go.
Special delivery.
Cameras are down. You’re clear. Gentlemen. Thank you all. Lots of luck.
Tadashi, can you hear me?
Right as rain. Ready for Roger.
It means yes. Yes, I’m ready. Which way do I go?
[ On phone ] We’re there. Bring the feeds back online.
Ruddiger, we’re back online. Show’s over. Get your men out.
Fancy meeting you here.
On the ground, now!
What’s the passcode?
I’m not sure I’d associate a high-security containment cell with my girlfriend, but I guess love is blind.
Good to see you, Harold. Hold your gratitude and appreciation till later. We’re in a bit of a rush.
The most predictable.
Everyone, this is Roxanne, the maître d’ at Delmar’s. I thought it best to discuss our next move on a full stomach.
With Vermont maple syrup butter dipping sauce. Please.
Yes, and, by then, we’ll need to figure out a way to infiltrate the protestors outside the arena, start a riot, pose as law enforcement coming to quell the insurrection, slip inside during the commotion, hack into the facility’s surveillance feeds to find the shooter before he kills the President.
Have you had(!) their Ethiopian porridge? Who will be the first responders to a disturbance outside the arena?
Then we’ll need Elizabeth and Donald assigned to the MPD.
Harold? Any favors you can call in? 
Next, surveillance feeds.
Aram, looks like you’re going back to college.
Lastly, The Third Estate. They have a permit to protest outside the debate. Fervent subversives that they are, I’m certain they and their colleagues will offer full-throated outrage. But to get inside that hall, we don’t need a protest. We need an insurrection.
I do.
And that’s the plan.
Donald, a word?
Elizabeth told me you had a run-in with a few Russians recently.
Yes. When you were investigating my identity.
Did you get a name?
As for answers, I believe Elizabeth has given you one.
Good.
I have an important meeting.
I couldn’t care less about saving the President’s life. I’m just trying to get your old job back. Have some fun. It’s gonna be a riot.
The consulate is on alert, which means everyone’s is.
They’re actively looking for Katarina.
Umh.
In an attempt to help her move on.
She did. So much so that she’s decided it’s safe to bring her daughter home.
If Moscow is looking for Katarina – if Agent Ressler’s inquiry has reignited their search–
I want this done before Masha’s daughter comes home.
Once. When we were children.
You’re always so optimistic.
I love you because I can trust you.
And the President?
And then got blamed for it.
Who’s the controlling authority?
Yes. Some.
We need an ambulance! Quickly!
With a coup d’etat. That’s original.
Okay.
Chuck will be. Morgan, it could go either way.
So, are you back? Does this mean I’m forgiven?
Is that why you’re here?
It’s critical. But not as critical as knowing why you’re here.
Except for the real explanation.
He didn’t miss.
Mrs. Diaz, for the sake of brevity, please allow me to get right to the point. I understand you’ve been harboring a powerful secret. I need to know what that secret is.
Because of your husband. You and I both know that about four years ago, he accepted hundreds of millions of dollars from a Russian oligarch named Constantine Rostov. I blackmailed him about it at the time, but there’s more to the story, isn’t there, Mrs. Diaz?
The assassination attempt. It wasn’t aimed at the President. It was orchestrated by the President to kill you. A plot by a desperate man trying to get rid of his wife, while disguising her murder in the mess of what appeared to be a botched assassination.
Why?
Mrs. Diaz. Why does your husband want you dead?
The Russian money wasn’t used to buy the election. It was used to buy your husband’s reputation.
What did you want?
Proof.
Horrible, yes. But this was not a mistake, Mrs. Diaz.
It’s a new beginning.
You’re doing the right thing, Elizabeth.
She’d be proud of you.
Well, we’d better get going. [ To Kat ] May we walk you out? 
And intrude on your mother-daughter reunion? I don’t think so. And we need to be someplace.
Where?
You’re sure? 
Oh, my God.
[ SIGHS ] You have an address? 
I’m sure.
Katarina.
It’s not safe. You’re not safe.
[ MUTTERS ]
[ GRUNTS ]
[ GRUNTS ]
Where- Where am I?
What happened?
I can’t feel anything. Why can’t I move? Why can’t I feel anything? [ MONITOR BEEPING ] 
Katarina.
I don’t.
So they caught them – the people who did this.
Why can’t I feel my legs?
But I can’t walk. [ INHALES DEEPLY ]
There.
I can’t walk.
Why am in this thing?
So I’m paralyzed.
I’m paralyzed.
Will I ever walk again?
Who’s there?
Well, this must be very exciting for you.
A Frenchman who states the obvious – how unusual. Like a Swiss who argues. Or an Italian who doesn’t.
Fun.
202-555-0100.
Call the number.
You said you prefer illusion to reality.
I may have seemed like an illusion, but she is one someone you can never find. 202-555-0100.
Then you must not be interested in talking to me, because you can’t do one without the other.
Marvin Gerard. Sounds French.
[ On phone ] Yes?
Daniel Hutton.
Were you expecting someone else?
It is. But I’ve been paralyzed before. The spine of a blowfish pierced my wet suit off Pit–
Cheer up. I’m a man of my word. You did as I asked, so I’ll tell you what you’re dying to know.
The blowfish. I was stung off Pitcairn Island during a brief assignation I had with a rapturous descendant of Fletcher Christian.
Right now, I’m a little less concerned with what I can’t feel than by what I can – an insufferable itch on my cheek that I’m unable to scratch. Would you be so kind, Nikola?
Uh, the right cheek. Yeah, that’s right. A little higher.
Oh, no, a little higher than A-Almost–
I may not have told you what you want, but I told you all you need. You’ll never find Rostova.
She’s a figment – of the collective imagination.
Did she?
Some people in this world are soul mates. Katarina Rostova and I shared one. Betraying her would be like betraying myself.
Ah, Mila, my dear! You are a sight for sore eyes.
My God, no. Eating even a swallow of that gruel with all the bread and cheese, chocolate and wine on the other side of these walls? That’s more torture than a man can brave.
Ah! My chariot arrives.
I’ve been on the run half my life. I suppose now I’ll be on a walk. Or a roll.
Yes, well, walking or rolling, I intend to show my gratitude by sharing with you the finest night of drinking and dining one can possibly imagine.
Quite.
That ought to keep me from running.
Yes, Mila, please, do come in.
Let me ask you something. Do I frighten you, Mila, with all the police and the guards, the handcuffs?
I’m glad.
Ah! Would you mind turning up the music? I love this song.
Mila, please, just a little more.
I remember hearing this wafting across the courtyard and through the window of my apartment on Rue Jacob.
Unless you want whatever is in here, I suggest you be still.
Who are you working for?
Katarina?
And the beating?
Tell me about the beating.
Like Inspector Oban and the doctor.
There was no surgery.
And we’re not in Paris.
Then why the chair? Why can’t I feel my legs? Answer me.
And what happens if I don’t get the scheduled dose?
You make a sound, I’ll kill you.
[ Politely ) I’m sorry. Uh, my French is really only good enough for restaurants and little old ladies. Do you speak English?
Ah. Lovely. In that case, may I ask a favor?
I-Inspector Oban the one with the crooked little grin would you please tell him I’d like to speak with him? There’s an important matter I’d like to discuss.
Yes, I did. There’s something you should know. It’s an urgent but [ SIGHS ] private matter.
Please. Take off your coat. Have a seat.
Oh! Ha-ha! The keys.
I asked you here, Inspector Oban, or whoever you are, to tell you how much I admire your plan. And I do or I did. The paralytic agent – that was your pitfall. The medications wear off when not administered every four hours. I’m overdue for my next dose, so –
The next time you want to convince me I’ve broken my spine, you damn well better break my spine.
It’s either a bullet in the head or a needle in the arm. I’d take the needle.
Ketamine. The same tonic used to knock me out on the street. For a man your height and weight, 150 milligrams should do the trick and give you the most wonderful dreams. Or it might kill you. I’m pretty sure it’s the dreams. But I’m no doctor, and you’re no cop. Either way, I suppose pharma-karma’s a bitch.
Sorry you’re having a hard time.
I’ve always helped you.
I came to Paris to warn you.
Nobody knows you’re alive.
I never betrayed you.
I have nothing to tell you.
How long do I have?
[ GRUNTS ]
I’ve met my share of killers. I know who has the capacity to take a human life. I know the
But it is. If you help her – if you do nothing to stop her, you’re responsible.
Shh.
Belgrade.
I didn’t want that.
I didn’t know.
I- [ GASPS WEAKLY ] I can’t give you what you want.
I didn’t.
Yes.
I can’t.
Leave him alone.
—
[ GROANS ]
[ SLURRING ] What are you doing?
[ BREATHING HEAVILY ] 
[ WEAKLY ] I need your phone.
Mila. Mila, your phone.
Barely.
You have to get to Dom. She’s going after him. He doesn’t know he’s in danger.
Bring the cooler. I need platelets, frozen plasma – eight units.
Come alone.
If I don’t make it, you you know what to do.
[ GASPS ] You need to get us to the highway.
No, no, no, no doctors. Just the highway.
[ GROANS ]
We need to get to Dom.
[ GROANS ] If we don’t keep moving, they’ll find us.
W-What?
What do you mean they already have?
Why did you help me?
I’m not interpreting anything. She’s coming for you, and she made it very clear she’s closing in.
There’s no reason to risk it, Dom. This is your house. I know it won’t be easy to go, but there’s nothing heroic about dying when you don’t have to. This isn’t “Rio Bravo.”
81. Are you 81?
She knows you tried to kill her, Dom. She wants answers, but she also wants revenge. You set her up, betrayed her–
It’s complicated.
Oh, come on. Enough.
The truth is, Mila, you’ve stumbled headlong into a family squabble. And the Rostov family can be rather eccentric.
[ CHUCKLING ] Wait, what did Tolstoy say about unhappy families?
“Happy families are all alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”
Dom, we can help you. We’ll take what we can.
But too young to die.
To the beach, the mountains. How about the Tetons?
I think we have the day.
What do you mean, “don’t”?
Yes, out of my neck, but not out of her own. We didn’t escape, did we, Mila?
Hoping I’d lead her here, to Dom. How much time do we have? Mila. How much time?
Dom, I suggest we find that extra box of shells.
[ To Mila ] Who are you? You’ve thrown your lot in with me. I should at least know your name.
Tell me, Francesca. How is it that you turned out to be my guardian angel?
Are you really a nurse?
Steinhil.
Tell me about it – the con.
Tell me.
Steinhil’s smart. He knew I’d be overconfident after figuring out the hospital wasn’t real–
–that I’d think I’d solved the puzzle when I’d only gotten one piece.
He knew I wouldn’t see his fingerprints all over the escape.
You shot the guard.
All that and the chip in my neck. Inspired. When this is over, I must see about putting this Steinhil on retainer. So – you’re not a nurse who’s afraid of her own shadow. You’re a soldier.
What do they call a combat medic in the army?
Dembe, give the woman a shotgun.
Dembe! Dom’s hit!
Okay. One more step.
That’s it. All right, sit.
Something for his head.
There you go.
All right. Get him up.
That’s it.
We open it, she’ll kill the three of us and eventually kill him.
Elizabeth! It’s us! Is it clear?
Dom’s hit. We need to get him help now.
That’s it.
Yes, it is.
Because we’re not going to the hospital.
Yes, and I intend to get him the best one available.
He’s a Rostov, Elizabeth. If we take him to an emergency room, questions will be asked, questions he’s not prepared to answer.
She was very convincing.
Yes, and now she’s the best hope your grandfather has to survive.
Called Dembe on my way to Dom’s, and given my condition, he felt it prudent to assemble one of our triage cubes.
Turns out, it was.
We’re almost there.
And a lifetime left to say it.
Then you do it.
I don’t care what you are. Do you know how to do it?
Do you know how to do it?! Just do it! These people can help you with whatever you need. Do it!
Not now, Elizabeth.
That isn’t a question.
You did. You and Agent Ressler.
[ Low but angry voice ] How many times have I told you? Leave it alone. I warned you. Even saying the name Katarina Rostova has consequences, and now you see. Now you see what that name will make others do. These questions of yours have gotten their attention, and now they will crawl out of whatever hole they were in, and they will hurt whomever they must – just on the chance, just on the notion that she might still be alive. “What happened?!” Elizabeth. You raised an old ghost, and that’s why your grandfather is dying in a lumberyard.
[ Solemnly ] I’ve been trying to decide what to do about you. I suppose by warning us, you saved our lives, but you’re also a large part of the reason our lives needed saving. The things you’ve done – I’ve killed others for less. I appreciate what you did for Dom. It’s the reason you’re still alive. But to be clear, it does not make us even.
I intend to find the woman who did this.
Perhaps you can help me find her. Perhaps not. Time will tell. But until we are even, you’re not going anywhere.
We don’t know if his brain was deprived of oxygen, and if so, for how long. If he ever does wake up, he may not be himself anymore.
Ahh. I’ve known Dom a long time. Most of it’s been – unpleasant. Still, something happens when you’ve when you’ve known someone that long, when, after all of life’s twists and turns you look over and there they are, still in it with you, still yours.
When he gets better, you should bring Agnes to meet him.
“To creep softly like a coward toward the treasures of your body,
As a general rule, I believe the sword is mightier than the pen. But in the hands of a free-spirited, syphilis-ridden French dandy, I’d say the odds shift considerably.
We saw him this morning. He’s still – critical.
You know Baudelaire was prosecuted for offenses against public morality?
His words were so provocative that six of his poems were banned for nearly a century.
I do. A secret society named after Baudelaire’s “Les Fleurs du Mal.”
Thrill seekers. People who go to extreme lengths to offend public morality. A society of decadent misanthropes. People who have everything, so nothing is special.
It does.
Motya?! I’m sorry to barge in unexpectedly, but I’ve called repeatedly, and there hasn’t been hide nor hair of you, so I thought I’d come and check to see if you’re okay.
And you’re okay! Thank God! I thought maybe Ed Broadfoot and his sons had finally tracked you down and dragged you off to one of those gravel pits.
It’s about the Townsend Directive. I understand it’s been reactivated that you and everyone else who bought in are actively hunting for her.
Motya, I need to take care of this myself. It’s personal.
To be fair, she’d been screwing him for months.
Too soon, the comment about the wife?
Good talk.
Yeah, you were right. But we had to try. And now he’s forced our hand.
Greetings!
Because you remain in my debt.
Yes, after putting it at risk.
I’ve got people working on that.
Congratulations! That shouldn’t be a problem.
I prefer to think of it as looking out for my best interests. Please, find yourself another seat. Relax. Read a book. Watch a movie. Do you like Truffaut? We have the complete collection.
[ To Dembe ] What did Stevenson say?
Someone from the hotel staff, then. Surely we can incentivize a maid or someone from room service to take a photo.
“Day for Night.” Definitely.
Oh, that’s none of your concern.
Conceivably.
That’s Motya Morozov. He’s one of the two men I need you to photograph.
I have photographs of both of them.
What I need is a photograph of them together.
The other man’s name is Fields.
Despite staying at the same hotel, being seen together would be–
–quite damaging. They’ll take every precaution to prevent that from happening.
I’m not surprised. The FBI are not known for their discretion.
As I said, neither party–
An oversight, admittedly.
A small, select group of agents are in my employ.
Unfortunately not. I can see this was a mistake.
How are you gonna do it?
Ding-dong ditch. I loved playing [ CHUCKLING ] that as a child! [ LAUGHS ]
[ To Dembe ] She’s good – She is very good. [ LAUGHS ] [ CHUCKLES ]
[ LAUGHS ] Dembe, we can tell Edward we’ll be ready for takeoff in 20. Francesca. Your husband, what’s his name?
Absent head winds, in two hours, you and Paul will be celebrating your anniversary at The Peppermill as planned. I recommend the corn chowder. [ LAUGHING ] Oh, my! Ding-dong ditch. [ LAUGHING ]
Is that stroganoff? Yes! [ LAUGHS ] Mmm! I’m always hunting for a new recipe.
I did. After our last conversation, I felt you needed a soupçon of motivation.
Yes, I know, you’d shoot first and not bother with the questions later. But – But(!) quite a bit has changed since then.
They prove you went to Miami [ WHISPERING ] to meet in secret with the FBI. I was told you were a snitch. And unless you do as I instruct, everyone else will know the truth, as well.
When you get a lead, I get a lead. When you get a location, I get to go there first.
Mmm. The nutmeg is nice. Needs salt.
You said The Peppermill didn’t deliver the champagne?
Francesca said she was married. But according to Glen, the DMV database lists her as single.
When it’s appropriate, I’d like to engage your services.
We are. You’re under no obligation, but I could use a capable operative.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, how rude of me. It’s your anniversary. Did you make it to The Peppermill?
And here I am talking shop. Go, have fun. I hope Paul knows how lucky he is.
[ On phone ] Hello? Elizabeth? Elizabeth.
Okay.
Tell me.
Steinhil. Where is he?
Visiting old ghosts?
Well, that’s not possible.
Daniel Hutton is dead, Harold. We both know that.
Did I know what?
I gave you that so you could put the whole incident behind you, not carry it like an albatross around your neck. I believed, as you believed, that the man was dead and that the issue of what happened there in Kuwait was resolved.
I suggest the utmost discretion. To preserve flexibility.
It’s Iran, Harold. We can’t just stroll through the front door. We don’t know what we’re walking into. So we keep it small. No team. Just you and I. Until you look this man in the eye.
We’ll soon find out, won’t we? 
I forgot how handsome you were back then, Harold. And how loosely tethered to the facts.
Ah! So Elizabeth finally told you. She took longer than I thought she would. Once word was out, I figured I was on borrowed time. And I’m sure, knowing you as I do, that you’ll feel an obligation to report this to the powers that be.
If you do that, Harold, they’ll take the task force away from you. It’ll be the end of what you’ve built.
Mm. Well, we’re not finished just yet, are we? You must admit, though, it’s ironic. Us jetting over there to protect your secret, and you refusing to protect mine.
Keep telling yourself that.
I know because — I know. Because whoever I once was, I am now and will continue to be Raymond Reddington. Given where we’re going, the real question is, who are you? Are you the man in front of me who I know to be good and decent? Or are you the man from years ago who got himself into this mess in the first place?
Do you think Hutton knows? Do you think he has any idea what part you played in what happened back then?
Let’s hope not. Because if he does hold you responsible and if he plans to tell the world, then we’ll have to shut him up.
No, I know. [ INHALES DEEPLY ] I guess that’s why I’m here.
Farhad! You son of a cur. It’s been an awfully long time.
[ LAUGHS ]
Of course, you remember Dembe. And this is the associate of mine we spoke about.
Sanctions have caused a certain amount of investment in Iran to dry up. It’s a barren garden. I decided to water it.
It’s all the rage! Despite my associate’s reflexive flag waving, he’s a fine man in need of careful guidance in and out of this CIA outpost everyone pretends to know nothing about.
Fortunately, the right bribes can get a man where he needs to go. I’ll have a double Scotch waiting for you when you get back.
I’ve made a lot of trouble in Iran through the years. Best not to have a sore thumb sticking out. 
Taste a bit of allspice?
Huh. [ WATER BUBBLING ]
I would assume as much. But I’m sure the Revolutionary Guard would like to have him.
Well, time, for now, is on our side. [ WATER BUBBLING ]
Have you heard from Harold?
How many extra men can you bring me? I’m paying $3,000 a man now. I’ll double it. I need men who can shoot straight.
Ah. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] Harold? You on your way?
What kind?
Harold, you got to get the hell out of there right now.
The roads are swarming with patrols, which means The Simoon is already on the scent. You need to get back to the airstrip as fast as you can. We’ll have the engines running.
And he’ll burn the city to find him. I’m bringing on extra men. We’ll lock down the landing field. You just get yourself there in one piece, and I’ll get us airborne.
30 minutes. Go. Now. [ To Farhad: ] That gives you 15. Notify your men. Tell them to expect a fight. It’s gonna be a hell of a lot more difficult getting out of town than it was getting in.
[ On phone ] You answered the phone, so you’re still alive. Where are you?
What’s wrong?
That’s pretty new. And expensive.
Harold, you need to get the hell out of there right now.
Harold. Harold, talk to me.
[ To Dembe ] Get the Post Office on the phone. Harold!
The last thing I heard was men yelling in Farsi. Lots of it. That was 13 minutes ago. And if Harold was taken, they may have put him in another vehicle.
No, there’s no time for that.
I can do better.
Way better. And more importantly, faster. We have one chance to get Harold out alive. So listen carefully.
[ On phone, in his plane ] Splendid. Please thank Francesca for me. And trust that as far as Harold is concerned, we are now in the gifted hands of a master.
Time to storm the castle.
You’re right. Even the Magnificent Seven had seven. Slim chance of survival. Impossible odds. This’ll be fun.
Where’s your faith?
We breach in two minutes.
Yes, but not our blood.
20 seconds.
Farhad, you and your men to the south. Dembe, you and I to the north.
10 –
9, 8 –
Here we go. [ CHUCKLES ] I won a rather high-stakes game OF “MAGIC: The Gathering” recently, and I’ve called in my chits.
Wait, listen to this. Listen. [ MISSILE WHINING ]
[ LAUGHS ]
[ LAUGHS ] That our cue, fellas. Let’s go.
What took you so long? 
Harold, you okay?
We have to go. He isn’t your burden anymore.
What is it you need, Harold? A reminder that you’re a good man, a moral man? ‘Cause you didn’t need to save Daniel Hutton to know that. You just needed to look in a mirror.
And it’s time to let it go. Now come on! We need to move.
You did what you thought was right.
Put your safety on the line for a man you thought was your friend. He betrayed you, and now he’s dead. Your secret is safe. If there was ever a reason to celebrate, The Simoon is finished. You helped yourself and your country. Close the book. Raise a glass.
I don’t live a lie. I may once have had another identity, but that identity no longer exists. I am exactly who I am. And I can assure you, I’m a far more interesting Raymond Reddington than Raymond Reddington ever was.
I’ve always believed who you are should define you, not who you were. And I don’t know anyone that should be more at peace with who they are than you. Whatever decisions you make going forward — I hope they grant you that peace.
You’re giving the Navy Cross to The Simoon?
You were told he was dead.
If it had been you, you never would’ve betrayed your country.
That won’t wipe his slate clean.
So you’re a truth-teller now. Did you tell Panabaker the truth about me?
Well, I guess fourth time’s the charm. [ In Portuguese: ] What’s the problem?
[ LAUGHS ] William Burroughs said the same thing to me once.
Tell me.
Ah! Ernesto’s a concierge nurse. Ernesto coordinates a burgeoning portfolio of urine samples and blood draws. As a bonus, he doesn’t understand a lick of English, so, please, speak freely.
Well, he’s an ingenious assassin. Who hides murder behind illness.
Paris was not your fault.
I spoke to Linda. She says you haven’t slept well since it all happened.
Well, we both did.
Linda tells me your goddaughter’s getting married Saturday. You should go–
–Get drunk, dance the hora, and forget.
[ CHUCKLES ] My friend.
[ Portuguese ] Thank you, Ernesto
Elizabeth. I have a case for you.
[ Chuckling ] Unbelievable.
A friend told me you had a keen eye for salt and pepper shakers. She was wrong. You have an exquisite eye.
I once saw the most adorable little ceramic set in a junk shop outside Topeka – salt in a straw hat, pepper in a bowler, both delicately balanced on a tiny green hat stand. [ LAUGHS ]
Eh, an admirer. Of all things precious. Including information.
Whatever you know about Norman Devane.
As a rule, I also admire loyalty. But as I have pressing business with Mr. Devane, I’m afraid you’ll have to make an exception.
Perhaps these will change your mind.
Technically speaking, they’re pepper casters. Handcrafted American silver from the workshop of Paul Revere.
I’m surprised you would even ask.
I don’t mean to press, but I have a meeting in an hour with Raúl.
Yes, and unlike Fidel, he’s a stickler for punctuality. So – Devane.
Is this a Frommer? I knew a gaucho who had a pearl-handled one in Patagonia, of all places.
He swore by it. Though he did say the trigger was a little sticky.
Ooo! Ooo!
[ LAUGHING ] Oh, what the hell? I barely touched the trigger!
Well, he must have disabled it.
Oh! Ge — [ CHUCKLING ] Ohh, God! Obviously, he set it to a hair trigger. The man clearly had a death wish.
[ CHUCKLES ] You should take a shower. Get some clothes from his closet.
Elizabeth. Write this down. National Diagnostics Lab.
[ LAUGHS ] Cheer up! Dembe found a text on Kuragin’s phone. It seems Mr. Kuragin hacked into the agriculture department and learned that the Chinese are about to impose a tariff on pork bellies. He may have expired before telling us all he knew about Devane, but we’re gonna make a fortune in the futures market.
Neither can I. [ SETS DOWN BOTTLE ] But I can accept it. Things happen.
I try to leave nothing to fate, but I’m perfectly comfortable with chaos. That’s why I trust that whatever happens is probably meant to be.
Cosmic, huh? Like you ending up in a velour tracksuit. It looks comfortable as hell, I must say.
You said you had two possible leads. What’s the second?
[ INHALES DEEPLY ] How about this wedding?
Because it’s a distraction?
But what if it did? What if the wedding helped us solve Paris? Would you go then?
Weddings, for the most part, are safe, happy places. Places that even the most skittish source would be comfortable in.
Drunken revelers, interminable toasting, cheesy cover bands – I can’t think of a better place for a covert meeting.
That’s all anyone can do. The rest, we leave to fate.
Then you need to change. We’ll have you home in a jiffy. Things are looking up! Between you and Devane, we now have two lines in the water. A fish will eventually bite.
Did you find Devane?
I need to speak with him.
Why children?
Children of Mercy. So Ressler isn’t with you.
License and registration, please.
I’ve always wanted to say that. Please, unlock the doors and step out of the vehicle.
No, really. Unlock the doors. I’m taking Devane.
[ To Devane ] Come on out.
He was. He’s not anymore.
I have no idea.
It was a two-for-one sale.
He wasn’t trying to kill the boy. He was trying to cure him.
He experimented on them. On all of them. And some of the children survived, but only because he wanted them to, because he cured them. That’s right, isn’t it, Norman?
I know that’s what you’ve done. What I can’t figure out is why.
I understand what you’ve been exposed to is what you gave him. But you also gave him the cure, and you’re wondering if it worked. Well, we’ll just have to get back to you on that. Let’s take a stroll down memory lane, shall we? The drone strike. After the strike, you went from hundreds of victims to – ten? Why? What changed? — I have all day. You? What? An hour, maybe less?
It seems the germ doctor is a germophobe. A word to the wise and dying – you can’t cheat death. You can’t predict it or protect yourself against it.
Which brings us back to the boy. Immunotherapy drugs are carefully calibrated to a particular individual.
100 million patients, and you find a handful who have enough in common with you to guarantee that if the cures worked for them, they’d also work for you.
As soon as you tell me about a Russian operative you did contract work for in 1986. She reached out to you recently. I want to know why.
Tell me about the Russian. Tell me about her, and I’ll do everything in my power to get you the cure.
Is she sick?
She cares for no one.
You do.
Who are you calling?
That won’t be necessary.
Because I have the cure right here.
He looks better already.
I apologize, Spalding. You offered your services, and I returned the favor by acting intemperately.
It won’t be. I just called my cleaners. They’ll take care of everything.
[ To Dr Stark ] Agent Ressler is as crooked as the crooked man’s cat. You have nothing to worry about. But apparently I do. You haven’t mentioned my blood panel results.
Not for good news.
It’s better this way.
About my chart.
Why not?
I’d appreciate if you didn’t mention anything about it to Elizabeth. I wouldn’t want to cause her any unnecessary concern.
I’m glad you think so, Donald. Because I honestly don’t want her to worry. Whether she does or not is entirely up to you.
Looks like he set him up after Stark got out of prison. He always believed the guy was a visionary. Probably wanted to reinvest.
I told you with two lines in the water, we were bound to catch a fish, and we did.
And a prognosis.
Stark’s treatment was ineffective.
Sometimes, things happen for a reason. And sometimes I just don’t know what that reason is.
There is actually. Some guy, Patrick Masuda – I need some help to find him.
Donald, I’m gonna quietly cross my fingers before I ask, but what blood type are you?
And you thought we had nothing in common. There’s only 2% of us, you know.
… A word to the wise and dying – you can’t cheat death. You can’t predict it or protect yourself against it.
And then she saved it. And Dom’s.
I want to reach out. Just tell her there’s an urgent matter we need to discuss.
Elizabeth.
He already told her about my involvement?
I disagree.
Ah, but it is my decision, and I have a different choice. Francesca Campbell.
True, but she’s talented, and I like her.
This strange incident at DXE Labs.
It’s hard to believe because it’s not true. There was no bomb.
The digital world is filled with anonymous malcontents hiding behind screens, conducting all manner of spurious acts. Their latest pleasure seems to be putting false words into the mouths of innocents.
[ CHUCKLES ] “Deepfake.” Kids today.
And you wonder why I insist on flip phones and dead drops. Honestly.
Whoever released the video wanted this shooting to happen. Suicide by cop. Or rather, murder by cop. Dr. Alexander held a high-ranking position at one of the foremost defense contractors in the country, giving him access to classified intelligence. I fear his death may be the precursor to something far more sinister.
Trust is so fragile. When it exists, anything is possible, between people or nations. But when it doesn’t, or worse, when a bond of trust is broken, there is no greater betrayal. Cigar?
Well, not down to the stub or anything. Want to keep the lungs clear, but a celebratory puff or two can’t hurt.
Your new job. On the Task Force.
As my life often depends on it, I have become an astute judge of character. And in our short time together, I have come to judge you as trustworthy.
I’m at war with a worthy adversary. Someone capable of exploiting even those closest to me.
I need you to keep an eye on an associate who I believe is about to betray me. Picked these up in Havana last week – from Castro’s personal humidor. Communism may be discredited, but it still produces a damn fine cigar.
Might I call you back in, say, 20 minutes? Or you know what? Make it 30.
Dembe and I are just wrapping up an absolutely delicious and long overdue lunch date with Brimley. He’s made his mother’s apple brown betty, and turns out the sweetness doesn’t really come from the sugar at all but from the Ribston Pippin apples themselves.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Mm. It’s very winning, the way you’re promoting Agent Park.
Another video?
Which is probably an alias.
Oh, happy to look. Send it to Dembe. We’ll turn over a few rocks. I’ll call you back posthaste.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh. And I thought I died once in Marrakech. Lovely, Teddy. Thank you. Mmm.
Well, hello, there.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Please. Word on the street is you’re the man that goes by the name of Higgins.
I’m the man with a few questions.
Ah. This is the man who’s gonna be asking the questions.
I don’t see– No, I-I understand there’s traffic, Fudo. But you said 2 minutes about 20 minutes ago, okay?
Right. No– All right, fine. You know what? Just- Just park the car and get in here.
You must be Agent Park.
It was a miscalculation.
Evidently, your source had an ulcer that ruptured as a result of undue stress.
Ah, there you are, finally.
Okay, you know what, Fudo? I don’t want to hear it. All right? Brimley is a mess. The source is dead.
The apple brown betty.
Higgins was a hitman. He said he was paid through a numbered account to assassinate an Almacorp scientist in Arlington named Tracy Long.
No, I– But you did say there was a darkness about her. If one were to wonder how dark, I’m afraid the answer would be not very.
Talk to me, Francesca.
Are you with him now?
4th and West. We’re on our way. And, Francesca, I knew I could count on you.
Hello, Vontae.
I came here to see the person who has betrayed me.
And here I thought I was such a good judge of character. What a pity. I was prepared to change your life. Now you leave me no choice but to end it.
Vontae, how’s the book?
Who’s your favorite character?
This was a test. You failed.
Yes. It’s called a deepfake. Forgive the theatrics. Baldwin insisted. He’s always been a bit of a showman. Gentlemen, your work here is done.
I had such high hopes. What happened? I’m genuinely curious.
Ah. Well, your loss.
Agent Park, bad timing.
Why are you here, Agent Park?
What do you know?
Because you’re my burden, not hers.
She is always two steps ahead of me. I cannot figure out how.
Ohh, you’re not only my oldest friend. Today you’re my favorite.
Why? Who is he to her?
You’re just in time! Campers’ breakfast. Onions, peppers, potatoes, last night’s roast beef all draped with an egg basted easy.
Elizabeth, meet Frank.
Oh! [ CHUCKLES ] I acquired it after a rogue wave in the East China Sea swept a shipping container full of baby formula right off the stack. Chinese mothers don’t trust the domestic stuff. Purity issues. So I sneak in America’s finest at a small markup. Zhou Jiaxuan was so mortified that he lost my shipment that he offered me his little home away from home as partial recompense.
What do you make of Governor Sweeney’s sudden reappearance?
And now he just walks into a local hospital on the very day of a special election to replace him?
The Bureau is wrong. The Cironatos don’t abduct politicians they disagree with. They buy them off. The person who did this is plotting something far more interesting.
Then why isn’t he talking? No politician returns from a harrowing abduction and says nothing, not unless the person who did it still has their hooks into him.
[ CHUCKLING ] Well, call it whatever you want. But whatever it is, it hasn’t fully happened yet. All right. I think we’re ready.
Oh, my goodness. Quality sleep on a stakeout. Oh! How did we never think of this before?
Well, this is just a bunch of gangbangers.
No. He’s trying to make a deal with them. Negotiating. The guy in the tragic camouflage, he’s the killer in the bunch. Huh. Deal’s closed.
[ EXHALES SOFTLY ]
Nothing an honest answer or two can’t cure.
Tell me about yourself. What do you do for a living?
I just watched you negotiate a deal with a gang of gangbangers.
You’re a thief?
What I got to do is understand why Katarina Rostova would pay to cure you of a fatal blood disease.
Of course. Constance Drucker. What do you say we take a little drive so you can tell me more about dear old Constance?
Katarina.
Tell me, Patrick. With these advantages you’ve been given – why are you boosting car stereos and consorting with riffraff?
A young boy robbed of his parents and all of the comfort and security that is every child’s divine right. You’d think that’s as bad as life could get. And here your fairy godmother promised to keep you safe. Well, we’re gonna put that promise to the test.
Well, that’s not exactly what you want to hear from your fairy godmother. Well, what do you expect? Over the years, it’s a tough job, fairy godmothering. And sometimes the old wings just can’t get you there fast enough, like right now.
And Dom’s been retired for years, but that didn’t prevent you from shooting him, did it? I want a meeting face-to-face, or I’ll return the gesture and put a bullet or two in dear Patrick.
Which you’ve ignored.
His game ended long ago.
I’m not interested in an address. I’m interested in you coming to me. If this delightful young man means as much to you as it seems, you’ll start flapping those decrepit old wings and flutter on over here.
Punishment is the crudest form of education, but it’s the only one that woman understands.
Seems you have more than one fairy godmother. Go on. Get out.
[ Calling after him ] And make something better of yourself.
I did it because we have a new lead – one she had no intention of giving us.
Motya. I found it prudent to follow your lead and shoot first. The only question is who to shoot second.
I guess we know who’s third. I instructed you to contact me the instant you had a location on Rostova.
Who you are is an aging leg-breaker with psoriasis. I assume you found the lead on Katarina but, instead of calling me, attempted to bring her in yourself, hoping to relive your glory days and sell her to the highest bidder to keep you rolling in potato vodka and herring for the rest of your life. You’re not the first one to underestimate that woman, which is why it was imperative that you call me.
I can’t imagine.
As I live and breathe! Skip Sutherland! Dembe, look at Skip. Skip, whose side are you on these days?
Morozov, there’s a reason you can’t break this man. Because he has something you’ll never have.
Backbone beats wishbone every time. Let’s cut him loose. I assume you denied Morozov the information he sought because he was gonna shoot you either way. And you were good and right. But you know me, Skip. So here’s the deal. I’ll provide you the best medical treatment and protection money can buy, provided you tell me what I need to know, right now. What did she hire you to do?
Which one?
Well, that certainly changes everything. We need to get him some help and get the hell out of here fast.
Well, that certainly changes everything.
She has him.
Dembe. She has him.
She’s been ahead of us every step of the way, and now she has someone who can tell her everything she wants to know.
That’ll be even worse. We need to find Ilya, and we need to do it fast.
Thank you, Eric. Would you both please leave us?
Bad news, Skip – for Ilya, for you.
I need to know where they are.
That’s the wrong answer.
What did you think would happen, Skip? You sold, to one of my worst enemies, the location of one of my dearest friends.
How were you paid?
What bank?
How do I find him?
Dembe, call Edward. Tell him to get the jet ready for London. I want us in the air within the hour.
Ah. Knight to F-3. You know, chess was originally devised in India. Back then, it was called Ashtapada.
Then it only seems fair I should know who you are.
Listen carefully, Arjun. Two weeks ago, someone from this establishment delivered a cash payment to a man named Sutherland. Might I assume it was you?
Good. That payment was made on behalf of a woman I’m looking for. Did she contact you?
Focus, Arjun. If you need to, by all means check your notes.
Tell me about the main office.
On the other hand, you would definitely be killed for not telling me this.
How big is the network?
And the person who runs the network, they would have a record of the woman who paid Mr. Sutherland?
I’ll need his name.
Elizabeth, I have something on very short notice.
It’s a case – Bhavish Ratna. He’s the next name on the Blacklist.
Bhavish. Is that you?
And you’re Bhavish Ratna. Now we’re friends.
I’m here as something of a guardian angel, Bhavish. It’s come to my attention that you’re the target of an FBI investigation.
And yet it is.
See the rather furtive ginger behind you? He’s FBI. Or if he isn’t, he certainly looks like he’s FBI. Same with the woman by the fence over there.
Because there’s something I want you to tell me, just as soon as I get you the hell out of here. See the gentleman behind me, by the black Mercedes? He’s your escape plan.
Say the word, and we’re gone.
Yes, well, never say never.
Are you really sure this is the time or place to get into a shoot-out with the FBI, Bhavish?  Putting your clients first before yourself while you’re surrounded by the authorities may prove to be somewhat shortsighted. No? [ Getting up ] Okay, just remember, when you’re left holding the bag, I’m the one who told you so.
Quite frankly, I’d be more concerned about your restaurant.
But you’re not. You’re sitting right here in my safe house. Have a nice cup of masala chai.
Eli Atticus, the extractor?
What if I could offer you a loan, make you whole?
I didn’t lose any money, Bhavish. You did, because you hesitated when you shouldn’t have. Now, normally, I charge 20% for a cash loan of this size, but given the circumstances, I could go as low as 19%.
As I said, you have information that I seek.
Before your tea cools.
Morgan, it’s me.
Well, tell the fellas upstairs we’re in urgent need of 3½ meal tickets.
Yes, now. Put it down at 19%, and please get it here as quickly as possible.
It’s come to my attention that you recently arranged for payment to a British agent named Skip Sutherland on behalf of a woman, Constance Drucker.
I need to know what other payments you may have made on behalf of Miss Drucker.
And the second?
Cheers.
Where are you?
Glen, clear your schedule. We have to talk. I have a job for you.
Harold, please, calm down.
It’s more complicated than that.
Actually, they don’t. You gave them an order. They followed it.
Yes, to put him in my debt by setting him free.
As a bird.
Harold, perhaps you haven’t fully explained to Agent Park how this arrangement works, or perhaps her sense of justice simply isn’t as nuanced as I had imagined.
I appreciate your frustrations. I’m sorry to put you in this position. But someone I care deeply about is missing, and I did what I did to try and find him.
That’s not your concern. What is your concern is Ratna’s banking enterprise. It’s come to my attention that Ratna is moving $3.5 million from the Zhao Crime Syndicate to Eli Atticus.
He’s an extraction expert who has a reputation for breaking high-value targets out of black sites and detention facilities around the world. If the Zhao syndicate is paying Atticus, it means they’ve lost someone that they want back. I don’t know who, I don’t know when, but I can assure you, there’s a prison break on the horizon, and it’s going to be bloody.
As my third executioner said, nothing voices contrition better than silence. Good talk. You’re welcome for the tip.
Well, I only just mentioned them.
That’s what I’m trying to figure out, Glen – who they are, what they do, how to make contact.
Glen, this is important.
Please, I- I need you to find these people as soon as human–
I don’t care.
[ Angrily ] Glen, there is no casino night. There is no DMV. Right now, all that matters is finding Orion Relocation Services.
Don’t tell me to take it easy. This is important. You’re a tracker, and I need you to find out everything you can about these people, right now.
The woman from Paris – She took someone I care deeply about. What’s happening to him now, what she’s subjecting him to –
– I can’t even begin to imagine, which is why I need to find him.
But I can’t do that unless you find Orion Relocation Services. Glen, I implore you. This is life or death.
[ On phone ] I’m sorry, uh, say that again?
You’re telling me Zhao Wing, the leader of one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the world, hires Eli Atticus, perhaps the preeminent prisoner-extraction specialist in the world, to target a city hospital? All to rescue a rank-and-file foot soldier in Zhao’s army?
No, Elizabeth, I do not buy it.
I don’t care if he’s the architect of Zhao’s entire empire. Shooting up a public hospital is an extreme measure, required only in the most desperate of circumstances.
So you wait to see if he’s negotiating a cooperation agreement in the first place.
So, why the fireworks?
Or maybe he knows exactly what Yang knows, and maybe Zhao needs to make sure that nobody else ever hears what Yang knows.
What are you doing?
Why aren’t you working?
Have you found them? Orion Relocation Services?
[ Leaning in, angrily ] We talked about this. There is no casino night. There is nothing but me standing right in front of you. Look at me. This thing we do, this whole dynamic? My indulgence of your relentless nonsense, your insipid banter? I tolerate it. But don’t lose sight of the fact that this is a business relationship. You’re a finder. You exist to me because you find things. Are you telling me that you can’t find what I need you to find? Because if that’s the case, I will end this right now. And don’t think I won’t because we have a history. If my friend dies because of you—  Orion Relocation Services. Find them.
Glen. About earlier. I must say, I feel terrible.
What’s this?
You found them.
Thank you, Glen. I’m in your debt. And about before–
Roulette – that’s your game?
For what?
Oh. Well, we wouldn’t want good coffee to go to waste, would we?
I don’t know how, but that woman stayed well ahead of me. She got to Steinhil, she’s apprehended a dear friend of mine.
He does. And she’ll do most anything to get it from him.
We have very little time, but thanks to her hawaladar, we have a lead. Orion Relocation Services. She paid them to give her a new identity, a new home, new life. I don’t know where she is or who she’s pretending to be, but Orion Relocation Services, they do.
The man she’s taken, he’s like a brother to me.
Did something happen? Were you threatened? I thought the FBI had you under protective surveillance.
Oh, my. I must say, I’m very intrigued. I bartered a long weekend at my pied-á-terre in Montmartre for the invitation plus-one. This chef, Rasmus Ray, is something of an outlier in food circles. No restaurant, no menu. Plenty of youthful innovation. Apparently he only hosts these dinners when inspiration strikes, which bodes well for our evening.
Ah. Colonel. Looking dashing, as always. [ CHUCKLES ]
Just some colonel.
I believe that that’s our fence.
Mr. Potash. I hear you’re the man to see about a thief.
Not yet, but we’re about to make each other unholy amounts of money.
I don’t know how to make any other kind. Raymond Reddington.
And this is the Lydia Dart. A friend and client.
Well, it certainly just got interesting.
I think dining in the dark probably does enhance the senses.
[ CHUCKLES ]
I understand that Sofia Burke made a run at the Dresden Green.
Mm! Château d’Yquem. My uvula is positively quivering.
I wonder if a healthy finder’s fee would make it your concern.
Nobody touches the bird. What’s wrong with you people? There are only 400 of these little guys left in the world, and you’re gonna eat this one? You want to eat something? Eat a cow! There are millions of them wandering around. Better yet, eat a rabbit. They’re delicious! Low impact on the environment, sustainable. I mean, hell, they hump like– well, like rabbits. Uh, but our little feathered friend here [ OWL SCREECHES ] is coming with me. Chef?
Lydia? Smile, everyone. You just spared a magnificent creature.
Somewhere you need to be?
A personal one, I hope. I’m sure it’s been difficult since Tom. But you have Agnes now. You should be looking forward, not back.You deserve a bigger life.
Oh.
Sofia Burke! Your reputation precedes you.
I don’t want you to.
[ Gesturing ] Please.
Would you care for some tea or coffee?
We’re looking for some information about Orion Relocation Services.
Perhaps this will jog your memory.
[ CHUCKLES ]
Tell me how it all works.
So you can step into the identity of someone no one can find.
[ CHUCKLES SOFTLY ] How do you contact them?
Did they tell you your new identity? I’m paying for information. So far, you’ve given me relatively little.
It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t spend it all in one place.
Denise Young. To find Ilya, we need to find her.
And risk a delay due to Taco Tuesday or a suddenly ingrown toenail? I don’t have the time. Ilya doesn’t have the time. Unfortunately, the last person I would want to find Ilya is the person I need help from to find him.
We have a lead.
So you have been threatened.
He was. Before I shot him.
That is our best hope.
Hey. Hey. This woman. She was a client. You moved her. I need to know where.
Hey. Hey! Where is she?
[ SIGHS ] We were too late.
Eventually.
Shots fired in a residential neighborhood. Response time is probably 10 minutes.
It’s already been 5. I need to go.
And yet you’re here.
Oh, God, no. I’m terrified of the thing. [ CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ] Her eyes – hypnotizing.
Dembe, you heard her. To the War Room! Perhaps we’ll be greeted by the Praetorian Guard. “The War Room.” What a marvel of overstatement. Unless we’re in a war I’m unaware of. My gosh. That would be marvelous.
[ Looking up ] Is something wrong?
Why don’t you just call her, ask her to stay?
Are you sure this is everything you confiscated from Orion?
She doesn’t have a name. She’s a ghost. Think of a name, any name, and that could be it.
She does.
She’s on the run. People are after her, and she wants to know how to stop them.
Killing me wasn’t her plan. She wants answers, so she tried to con me first. When that didn’t work, she tried advanced interrogation. That didn’t work, either. So, yes, I think my friend is still alive, but I think she’ll employ any means necessary to get what she wants, to get inside his head to—
Krilov. Krilov.
Dr. Bogdan Krilov is the underworld’s foremost expert in accessing the subconscious. The man can get anyone to talk.
Which means she’d have to hire a protégé.
Maybe, but if she is, Krilov would know with whom and how. I need to see him, Harold.
I’m sure you could get him out for a quick visit.
If I’ve learned anything in this life, it’s that anything is possible.
I’m gonna check on Elizabeth. Harold, see if you can round up Dr. Krilov. Donald and I have some catching up to do with the dreamweaver.
Elizabeth.
Harold. We have a problem.
No. The apartment’s empty, with clear signs of an altercation. This falls on us, Harold. We shouldn’t have let her go alone.
Yep.
What is it? Where are they?
[ On phone ] No need to notify your men, Harold. They won’t be taking any phone calls.
First Ilya. Now she’s got Elizabeth. She thinks she’s staying ahead of us. I fear she might be getting a little ahead of herself.
Make it two. Hershey’s or Nesquik? Or maybe you’re a Bosco man.
To kill you. For working with Mr. Kaplan. For betraying my trust. For hurting Donald in an attempt to hurt me.
A name of a protégé or colleague.
Mm. A competitor then? A rival, someone’s chipping away at your business while you’re in prison.
It’s not a where. It’s a who. Tongji is supposed to be some kind of a Chinese miracle worker. He’s rumored to provide a place where people go to find unfindable things, to forget the unforgettable things – a back-alley bazaar where he brokers whatever you need to ease your pain or dull your mind. As far as I know, Tongji only exists as a myth.
[ To Krilov ] Have a seat right there. [ To the Shopkeeper ] I’m here to see Tongji.
I do not.
Tell him it’s Raymond Reddington.
I have a gun. Does that count as an appointment? And I have a friend with a gun – two appointments.
Do you know how to find him?
The man we’re looking for is Victor Skovic.
I know that, as we speak, he’s sucking whatever he can from the depths of my friend’s cerebral cortex. Berdy Chernov is the man who brokered the contract.
I am not.
The wedding. Was it at the Fremont?
Frank Bloom is an alias for my friend. He went to that wedding to meet a contact and get the name of a man involved in my abduction in Paris.
Can you tell us what name he does go by?
Revenge doesn’t suit you, Donald.
Are you? I wonder.
No.
[ Pensively ] I’ve always lived my life very much in the moment. But what does one do when the moment is filled with anxiety and dread?
Agent Park, how long have you been here?
Dembe, has Harold texted you any new information on Gregory Flynn?
Are we giving you a lift somewhere?
Yes. If we can find him, we can find my friend.
Possibly.
Dembe, pull over. Agent Park, you are a treasure. I hope you don’t mind, but, please, get out.
There’s another rhetorical question.
I’ll call Chuck and Morgan. You call Heddie. We’re gonna need them very fast.
Sure it will. It’ll work.
It’s unlikely. District has more than 4,000 sworn officers. We’d have better odds of being killed by a vending machine.
Here we go.
And Elizabeth?
Get him out of there.
Heddie. You’re out of time.
No, we stay put until we see her.
She slipped through our fingers again.
I’ll be damned.
Keep your distance. We want to do this very quietly.
Soon. When we’re a little further away from surveillance cameras and prying eyes.
Death must be so beautiful. To lie on soft brown earth with the grasses waving over one’s head. To be at peace. I welcome that one day.
Thank you, Morgan.
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ] Medical team will be here in 10 minutes.
You need to rest. We don’t need to worry about her anymore.
It’s over.
The woman. 
Aram told me she’d been living in your building, feigning kindness, watching Agnes. But it’s over. She’s dead.
Gunned down in the street less than an hour ago.
I saw it happen. Two heavily armed assets. They took her body because they came for a bounty. She’s dead.
Elizabeth, go get Agnes. Take her home.
I’ve been reading to Dom. We’re halfway through “Beowulf.” Grendel’s mother, now, there’s a woman to be reckoned with.
Open this next.
Ah, come on, come on.
[ Laughs ] Yessiree!
The same. You knew, right?
You didn’t know?
Because of the guy in the jacket.
He wasn’t fo– I had to say something to get rid of you. I smuggled the damned thing onto the jet in my hat like some “B”-movie drug runner.
Happy birthday, my friend.
Hello?
I do.
No. For all six?
No, that’s nowhere near enough time.
Looks like we’ll have to eat our cake and ice cream on the jet. You and I are going to Artemivsk.
We have to get that casket.
Well, they have Russia for their guns. They don’t care.
This is bigger than me. I have an obligation to the others. If she has a buyer for the entire set, the profit would not only be obscene but flagrant. We have to go to the vault, get that casket. Time is precious.
Only my print opens the locks.
I don’t know. If they want me dead, maybe we should just give them what they want. 
Good Lord, that was rejuvenating. I slept like a vampire.
[ Laughs ] Good to see you, Vasyl. [ Hug ] Oh. You look well. Are these your guys?
Well, let’s be quick about it. There’s a mob’s worth of separatists who want my head on a stick.
Look at that.
It’s one of six. They descend in size from largest to smallest, each one fitting inside another.
Same idea, but the Matryoshkas didn’t appear until the late 1800s. This is Byzantine, 12th century, found in Turkey. Simply put, they weren’t even supposed to exist, not at that time, not in that part of the world. Once joined with its five partners, this little box will be more valuable than all the treasure in this vault and more.
Anything you care to share?
When were they called?
So they’re almost here.
Do they know?
Dembe, let’s move. 
In anticipation of a sale, I need you to appraise an item. Shouldn’t take more than a moment.
I’m in a bit of a rush, my love. What do you think it’s worth?
No, that’s impossible.
[ To Dembe ] Were there any signs of a break-in at the vault, anything missing?
Whatever thief is responsible for this must’ve forged and replaced the caskets before we ever got our hands on them. We stole a bunch of counterfeits. [ Laughing ] Oh, my God. This is unbelievable.
The others are gonna show up at our meeting and have no idea the entire thing is a hoax.
You said it. Cheerio.
You know, it occurs to me, if we can find the counterfeiter who created this, we might be able to recover the entire set of original nesting caskets for ourselves.
[ Laughs ] That’s the spirit. Lemons to lemonade, Dembe. Lemons to lemonade. 
What do you know about antique nesting caskets?
Some years ago, five colleagues and I acquired a complete set.
A kindly woman comes into your life and takes an interest in you and your child. It’s only natural for you to make that wish.
I know you don’t want it to be true, Elizabeth, but your mother is gone.
Mine is a forgery.
The irony is rich. As is the forger. If they fooled me, they’ve fooled others.
Forged or stolen art and antiquities represent up to 10% of an art market valued at over $50 billion. That’s $5 billion. And, yes, I have a stake in your finding this forger, but if they’re as good as I believe them to be, I’m giving you the tip of an enormous iceberg. 
Croft, I can’t tell you how happy I am to see you.
No, no, no. No, I– You understand. I had to tell them something. The truth would’ve been so uncomfortable for everyone involved. Ex-husband just popped into my head. I don’t even know if you have a wife. Do you?
Don’t answer that. Doesn’t matter. Please, have a seat. I took the liberty of ordering us a few martinis and the seafood tower. You’re not allergic, are you?
I thought we could crack some claws, get to know each other, see what hobbies we have in common, like, I don’t know, say, art theft.
Mm. Don’t fret.
I’m not the police, and I’m certainly not here to arrest you for buying a painting you [ whispers ] knew was stolen.
To tell you that I happen to know that the FBI are aware of the painting, aware of the theft [ Looks around ] of the painting, aware of the sale of the stolen painting. But not yet your whole part in it.
Yes. Well, and for a name – [ Whispers ] Of the person who sold you the painting.
Well, that would just leave you and the FBI – and the painting. Very awkward. [ Chuckles ] Very awkward.
Ah, magnificent. Perhaps a couple of bibs for the gentleman and me. 
Mr. Eagleton. I’m sorry to interrupt your ablutions. Looks delightful. But I’m in a bit of a rush and have some pressing questions that can’t wait for your contemplative soak.
Who did you buy this from?
Maybe the bubbles have addled your brain.
I love a good bath as much as the next man, but does it ever get into your head the idea that you’re simply soaking in your own juices like a brining turkey?
I digress. Doesn’t matter. Please, take a closer look at the piece. I know you’ve been fencing items on behalf of a counterfeiter who steals art from the Fenberg family. Well, that same counterfeiter is responsible for this breathtaking forgery. And while I admire the accomplishment, I prefer the original. So the counterfeiter’s name – I need it now.
How apt.
Just give us a second. It’s the damn GFCIs.
This might tickle a little.
Might even make your toes curl. Or not. What the hell do I know? Let’s find out.
The name.
You see? There it is. That wasn’t so hard, was it? Antony, let me ask you a question. Are you hungry? I’m hungry. Dembe, you hungry?
Okay. Hop out. Let’s get cooking. 
Ms. Fenberg, please join us. A waffle? They’re buckwheat.
Please, sit.
Have a waffle. I love a juicy family drama. Greed, resentment, betrayal, secrets. [ Chuckling ] And your secret? Oh, my. Using the spoils of your father’s avarice to bankroll his destruction. The tragedy is positively Grecian.
A man on a quest.
Does this look familiar?
Yes, but it’s part of a larger set. I came to acquire this one some years ago. Imagine my surprise when I learned it was a counterfeit. But tell me, did you make forgeries of all six boxes?
Well, you certainly fooled me.
Both, then.
The original casket. I want the name of the person who has it. Mr. Eagleton says that’s the one item of yours he didn’t fence.
Your father is a drug dealer. The fact that he deals a legal drug is no consolation to the addicts he’s created. He’s the villain in this story. Your efforts to bring him to justice, however convoluted, are, as I’ve said, admirably Oedipal. Not only do I have no intention of stopping you, I believe we may find occasion to work together in the future. I am nothing if not an avid patron of the arts. So, please, a name. 
Oh, just a dabbler. I told Victoria I didn’t want to impose.
Oh. I’m sorry, but before we start, might I trouble you for a glass of water?
Thank you so much.
Is it? Who would’ve guessed?
Cheers. 
It really is exquisite in its way.
The forger certainly played on our emotions.
The counterfeits are nearly flawless, which is enough, because our desire for them to be real obscures any imperfection, much like your desire for the woman in Paris to be your mother blinded you to the fact that she wasn’t.
So she told you she was Katarina?
I was convinced my casket was authentic. It was nearly impossible for me to believe it wasn’t. But it was a fake. And she was, too.
 No, I gave you the case so I could get my hands on the casket and sell it for an obscene amount of money.
Yes. And the buyer is apparently very impatient. Is there somewhere we can drop you? We’re wheels-up in one hour.
We’ll be back for the ballet.
Harold thought I’d like to know. He was right. 
Ha! So am I. What a ride. You can’t imagine what it took to get here.
What a place. This is lovely.
Oh, no, no, Dembe won’t be staying.
You should go before the sky gets any darker. Please. And don’t worry. I’ll see you here in two days, and we’ll celebrate.
Ah. Eat a whole pizza, read a couple of great books. Maybe take the kids skating. My God, I can’t remember the last time you had a whole weekend off.
I’ll see you Sunday.
Not to worry. 
Hello, Cassandra. You’re looking like the best of times.
I had to come. I couldn’t let down the others.
[ Nods ]The best part did.
Of course.
You’re convinced it’s the right time to sell?
Thank you, Arthur. 
Annika, your brow is already furrowed.
That’s a relief.
[ Laughs ] Same old Annika. You’ve been reading ghost stories.
Give me a hug.
You think the caskets we stole gave an archaeologist pancreatic cancer?
I believe you. Well, I believe you believe you.
That innate sense of danger is what drove you to become perhaps the single best security expert I know.
[ Chuckles ] Have you seen the others?
I can name three other can openers who could crack those locks. Only one could do it in 30 seconds, and none could do it after a half pint of aquavit.
Margo, you’re a Viking.
No dice.
I came here to [ kiss smack ] make money, not give it away.
Mahmoud, your hearing has gotten worse?
I’m terribly sorry.
Tell me, did I detect a chill in the air from the two of you? Are you on again or off again? 
Ah.
I don’t. As the architect, it’s Cassandra’s right to explore a next move.
That’s enough, Joko. You got 10% because you came in late, not because anyone here undervalues your contribution. As far as I’m concerned, the goon with the gun, he’s the real operator. He’s the one who has to handle himself under pressure when things go sideways. He’s the one everyone else has to rely on. The goon with the gun doesn’t do his job, there is no job. We needed you. Nobody’s ever said otherwise except maybe you. At the end of the day, you accepted your cut, and it’s done. So, let’s all take a breath and remember we’re friends.
Then I make five.
[ Echoing ] You should sit down.
Margo! Margo. Can you hear me?
I’ll ask Mahmoud if Margo has any family, and if so, I’ll see that they get her remains. Grab a tablecloth there.
Everyone, just try to calm down.
All right, Joko, you made your point. Margo could crack a bank vault in less than eight minutes under withering pressure. She had ice water in her veins. Okay, she didn’t make healthy choices, but this had nothing to do with stress or hypertension or a curse.
Someone who stands to gain from her death.
Mahmoud, look at me. We are genuinely sorry for your loss. But the truth is, we don’t have enough evidence to start accusing each other of homicide. I suggest we all turn in early and look at this with fresh eyes in the morning.
We do. Everyone else, take yours with you. We’ll reconvene here at 7:00 a.m. 
Yes, you shot at me.
You thought I was your husband.
I had something a bit more frigid in mind. 
Broken blood vessels in her eyes. Also on the inside of her lips and underneath her fingernails.
Not definitively, no, but it certainly suggests it. We won’t know for sure until we open her up.
We need towels– tongs, and a ladle. Doesn’t matter what size.
Can I have a towel?
I was going to. Till I found out we took nearly $40 million from that vault, not 30. You’re either very bad at math or very good at lying.
Another towel.
Can you hold that?
Tell me about Lisbon.
Why are you telling me this?
You brought it up. Why?
You sound like Annika.
The ladle. The ladle.
[ Sighs ] She bled to death internally. Must be half her blood supply.
[ Sighs ] Some kind of anti-coagulating agent. When blood’s that thin, you can spontaneously hemorrhage. Every organ, all your veins, arteries start leaking into the viscera.
This didn’t happen naturally. Someone killed her. Someone on this island. 
You wanted a forensic investigation. That’s what it showed.
Yes. She was poisoned, dosed with an anti-coagulating agent.
What I saw would’ve taken hours to develop– six, maybe even eight. What time did Margo get here?
Money.
Mahmoud, the man’s three times your size.  What do you intend to do, poke him to death?
Watch out.
I agree. But he wasn’t killed for the treasure.
I don’t know what’s happening, but clearly, this isn’t about the caskets. 
You going?
Hello? Hello?
Mahmoud.
Mahmoud! Mahmoud. Lower the gun.
Lower your weapon now!
Mahmoud, I won’t tell you again.
You were right. I have no reason to believe you. About Marseilles or about this.
And you cut a deal. Is that why you brought us together? Save yourself by giving us up?
Well, if they didn’t want us, what did they want?
An archaeological dig in the Kayseri Province.
Source– What sources?
They told you this? The FBI?
But they didn’t get the list?
And the CIA wants it back to protect the identities of their undercover agents.
It went sideways because they weren’t CIA agents. They lied to you. And we won’t know why until we read the microdot. 
Do you have your cellphone with you?
I don’t intend to make a call.
Ah, perfect. Now we just need a screwdriver and some tape– any kind of tape.
My father was fascinated by insects. Fancied himself an amateur entomologist.
Ah, great.  By the time I was 6, my father had taught me that a microscope is essentially two convex lenses in relationship to one another. I’ll never forget the joy on his face as he helped me make my first one, then watched as I went into the yard in search of bugs. The idea that a whole world that I couldn’t see had suddenly revealed itself and been brought into focus– [ Grunts ] –felt like a miracle.
What I see right in front of me is someone I misjudged. What’s happened tonight, I should’ve known. You could never have done it.
But we do that, you and I– misjudge each other. I tonight, you in Marseilles.
What you misjudged was the reason why. You thought it was about you. It wasn’t. I had obligations.
Yes. Her husband wasn’t who he appeared to be. She was in jeopardy. I had to intervene.
I hope not.
Not except to watch her daughter dance in “Sleeping Beauty” tomorrow night. You have the caskets?
In my suite. Mahmoud’s must still be in his, as well. If one of these four has the microdot, all we need is a little light, and we should be able to read it. Damn it. It’s so fussy, this. We need tape. We really need tape. 
The island staff. Turks got here before we did.
[ Quietly ] Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Thanks for coming. We have so many questions.
Let’s try this again, shall we? I want to know who you are and why you are here. I think you and your homicidal brethren masquerading as house staff are in fact Turkish operatives. I think you’re here to recover the microdot, the one the CIA officer hid in one of the caskets.
Do you know which casket you’re looking for? Fair enough. Maybe you don’t speak English. Let’s see if you recognize numbers.
3, 2, 1.
Ah, so you do understand numbers.
We’re about to find out.
Looks like your poor CIA officer did tell you the truth.
Yes, but it’s not a list of American assets in Turkey.  It appears we had it the wrong way around.
How many operatives does he have?
Never mind. I’ll ask him myself.
Ahmet’s taking a nap. To whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
I know that voice. Arthur Rodman. Cassandra, do you realize what this means? The butler did it.
Oh, I know exactly what you are. You’re the bloodhound the Turks hired to find the list of Turkish assets working within the American government. Wait a minute. Oh, my God. You’re Cornelius Ruck, aren’t you? [ Chuckling ] I’ll be damned. You tracked Korgeneral Ordu across the Gibson. They say you made do for three days on nothing but honeypot ants and eucalyptus. Oh, my God. Of course the Turks hired you to find the list.
We’ll need a little time to think about that.
That’s long enough. We’ve decided. We’re going to forego the offer to surrender. Wish us luck. [ Ends call ]
[ To Cassandra ] We don’t have a choice. We’re either leaving here with the caskets or–
Mm.
Mm.
So what now?
Oh. Well, any time would be good. Like now.
You all right?
Well, hold on. You forgot the fish.
The sailfish. Above the mantle.
What do you know? It stopped snowing.
Cynthia is nothing if not a fan of the dramatic reveal.
I’m not here to test your faith, love. Just to get a number.
This calls for a celebration. In the south of France, perhaps.
As you said, I fulfilled my obligation.
Oh, my God. [ Turns to Cassandra ] Ready?
I told you, I’m under no obligation.
Cassandra–
Watched from the wings.
I don’t.
And that you deserve a bigger life.
[ Sighs ] I don’t know how to do that.
You should get back.
To me, too.
And that you deserve a bigger life.
[ Sighs ] I don’t know how to do that.
To me, too.
No, it doesn’t work. I can’t. Because I can’t!
I told you I’m busy.
Glen, what the hell’s going on?
Discuss what? What’s happened?
I have a sinking feeling it can’t. I’ll be there within the hour.
It’s a little unclear. I’ll get right to it. Three weeks ago, there was an explosion at a data center in Virginia. Last night, a data center owned by the same company was attacked in Maryland.
So naturally, the FBI will assume they were targeted by some foreign entity looking for classified intel.
I’m a contrarian by necessity, not by choice. If people were wrong less often, my life would be much easier.
[ Laughs ] My sources have ruled out Tehran, Beijing, Moscow, P’yongyang. Dollars to doughnuts, this was a domestic affair.
Some extremist group against the government, in favor of more privacy. I don’t know. But whoever they are and whatever they’re after, it appears they won’t stop until they get it. 
What do you mean the Tokyo shipment didn’t go as planned?
So the vehicle’s not in Houston?
Glen, we talked about this. You wanted an assignment. We did.
My guy in Tokyo did his job. That vehicle came off the line, factory-built and shipped. Approved by customs. It cleared the port.
All you had to do was make sure it was routed to the dealership in Houston so you could buy it with the money I gave you!
Glen, look at me. Do you understand? That truck isn’t just a truck. It’s a test balloon carrying a shipment of black market tritium valued at over $12 million. If this shipment goes right, I land a contract that will pay dividends for years. If it goes south, I can’t begin to tell you how badly things go for everyone involved, starting with present company.
[ Laughs ] Oh, yes. You’re gonna handle it, all right. You’re gonna get on the next flight to Scranton, walk into that dealership, buy the damn truck, and get it here by Tuesday before my buyer is any the wiser. Am I clear?
You have two days.
Ah, there you are.
Oh, my. I do like that coat. Merino or cashmere?
That does not look like alpaca.
Ah, yes.
Oh, heavens no. A slight delay is all. My people at the port decided to take extra precautions, which is what you pay me for, to get your product here without incident.
Oh, speak of the devil. My man in Houston. Please excuse me.
[ On phone ] Do you have it?
Oh, my God, Glen. Is the truck there in Scranton or not?
Was it sold? What happened?
Well, uncomplicate it for me. Explain it to me like I’m a fourth grader.
This isn’t happening.
No, wait. Glen.
I’m coming there myself.
[ Laughs ] What a guy.
Jolly good. Your cargo is in country. That said, I think it may be worth discussing a slight adjustment to our Tuesday delivery plan. 
What’s with all the police?
How long has it been?
Forty– Oh, my–
Let’s give him a call.
[ On phone ] What the hell is going on?
I’m not talking about your feet. I’m talking about all the cops. Why is this place crawling with cops?
Glen, the merchandise on that truck–
Glen, please. Listen to me.
Wait, no, Glen! Hold on. You’re not back.
Oh, my God, no. Talk about bad to worse. He’s dug in like a deer tick.
We need the names and information of every contestant with a hand on that truck, because believe me, Glen’s not going anywhere, but if, all of a sudden, he drops like a sack, one of these other clowns is gonna be driving around town in our $12 million. 
And it’s getting done.
Don’t get you vicuña in a bunch. Take a breath. You came to me because you had no viable way to get your product into the country. This pipeline we’re testing, this concept of moving a single vehicle from the assembly line as a courier, it’s new. And it’s going to have unforeseen obstacles, which we obviously now have, which is why I asked for the extension. If that’s a problem, we’ll work around it. But rest assured, I have my top man on the job.
My top man.
[ Theatrically ] A man I trust, a man with whom I share a history, a man with whom I’d go into battle shoulder to shoulder any time, anywhere because his dedication knows no bounds.  If there is a man who can get you your shipment on time, it’s my guy Glen. So you can doubt me, you can doubt my services, but do not doubt Glen.
Yeah, well, so do I. 
But they needed to be reassured. You and I, on the other hand, know the truth– 
–so please tell me you have the information on the remaining contestants.
Good. Because we need to fix this thing before Glen bungles it more than he already has and costs us a fortune. 
Looking good out there, Father. A little too good, maybe.
Well, you got the big fella. But the little guy, the sweatband, track suit, and terrible feet, who’s he got? It doesn’t seem like a fair fight, does it?
Yes, but there’s nothing mysterious about the pain Glen is in–  Sciatica, herniated disc, hemorrhoids. But the real pain is, the guy’s a natural-born loser. He has never won anything, and he’s got his heart set on that truck. You’ve won, what? Twice? Well, you of all people would know, if he could come away a winner, [ Gasps ] it would be the answer to all his prayers.
Have you driven a Mercedes? How about a Mercedes? Surely, you can find salvation in German engineering.
Consider it tithing.
I’m a sedan man, myself. The S-Class is heavenly. But perhaps you’d be more comfortable in a G wagon. Or, hey, what about an SL Roadster? You and the missus out on the open road, feeling the wind in your pulpit gown?
Ah, with the executive rear seats, the massage function.
For your wafers and wife.
[ Calling after him ] Or perhaps a Sprinter for the flock. 
He’ll be here.
[ Laughs ] Well, I’ll be your huckleberry. Look who showed up! 
And with two minutes to spare, no less. [ Laughs ] What a man. What a truck! [ Claps ]
[ Chuckles ] As I said, never doubt my man Glen. I have to admit I was starting to doubt you, Glen.
Tritium is an extremely rare and radioactive isotope of hydrogen.
It is.
Not in the tank, Glen. The vehicle. Tritium is a gas that can be safely stored as a metal hydride. In this case, as truck parts. Which parts, I have no idea. The– I have no idea. It’s, you know, like Goldfinger.
I suspect they’re CIA. Tritium is an important component in nuclear warheads and has to be replaced frequently because of its short half-life. In any case, that doesn’t matter. You got the job done.
That, Glen, is your payment.
How long has it been since we lost contact with the driver?
That would take incredible luck. And the only time I have ever been lucky in Alaska was when I was bumped from behind at an ice bar in Fairbanks. I stumbled into the arms of a lovely Nordic princess. Literally, she was a princess in Norway. We flew straight to her castle outside Bergen and watched the Northern Lights till dawn. Otherwise, Alaska’s shown me all the mercy of a Greek tragedy.
Looks like it’s time to cue the Greek chorus, Dembe. 
The way you described her husband’s condition, it sounds more like a mercy killing.
You mean like dreams and memories. Maybe even a deep and abiding love for his betrothed.
A love so deep that he would have preferred that Elodie end his life so that she could move on with hers. If only he had the power to tell her.
How can I help you, Aram?
Get a blood sample from the body before it’s buried, and I’ll have it tested, no questions asked.
Do you know why I’m preparing this salmon?
It’s for a celebratory meal when the case is solved.
I’ve been robbed. Trucks of mine have been stolen. Precious cargo has gone missing.
I found the trucks. Sunk in a lake in the Alaska Triangle.
I don’t want you to find my trucks. I want you to solve one of life’s great mysteries.
The question isn’t whether they’ve disappeared. It’s why. Find the people who stole my trucks and you may get the answer. 
[ On phone ] What goods are those, Aram?
Yes, of course. I’ll arrange pickup with the lab tech for tonight. The bike path in Fort Slocum park. Midnight.
At any rate, it’s not much of a bike path. If you want a real cycling adventure, you should look into the Cowboy Trail, a defunct stretch of rail line–
Buongiorno!
Signore Rossi.
Look at you. Oh, how are you, friend?
My nose, of course.
Word has it you’ve formulated a new fragrance with musky depth and a passionate animalic note.
Oh, dio mio.
Oh. So warm on the top. Honey-like.
With a lustful, almost bottomless bottom. Is that ambergris?
I find ambergris to be an absolute marvel.
Digestive juices of the sperm whale – powerful enough to break down squid beaks and fish bones until the glorious beast excretes the waxy mass into the ocean. Whale vomit – worth more than its weight in gold.
And yet you managed to find some.
A private party in Alaska just stole a shipment of ambergris from me, worth about $3 million.
Mm. Who’s your supplier?
I understand. You have to protect your supply chain to maintain the high quality of your fine merchandise. Such as this extraordinary item.
Quanto costa?
Ah. That must be a heavenly scent.
[ Inhales ] Mmm. White birch?
Yes.
Oakmoss.
Write down the relevant details and, please, gift wrap one bottle of Rossi No. 1.
Speaking.
Twamie Ullulaq.
The stolen cargo I traced in Milan, Twamie took it.
I do not.
They did during the Cold War, didn’t they, Harold? Go on. Tell the kids about Operation Washtub
And when the Red Scare ended, so did that commitment. Imagine that. Your government breaking its promise to indigenous people. 
Agent Park.
We can discuss that over Shiozake.
I intended on bringing you together, yes, by abducting him, not you. That was unforeseen. But in the end, it served the greater good.
I do when your life interferes with my business. I know about your mother and her relationship with Mr. Lussier.
Because I must. You’re an excellent agent, Alina, and a loose cannon. I need the first, and I won’t tolerate the second.
My world is filled with people seeking revenge. I can see it every time I look at them. It’s as distinct as a birthmark. But I look at you and see none of that. I don’t see a quest for vengeance. I see a smart, capable young woman filled with self-loathing, and I think if you have a debt to settle, perhaps it’s with yourself.
And the debt you owe yourself?
You were a child. You couldn’t be expected to help. You shouldn’t hate yourself for that.
No, Glen, it’s fine. We’re already here. Yes, it’s right up the street from Cher’s hotel. Yeah. We get the ice, pick up the diva, and in a half-hour, she’s serenading Trudy with “If I Could Turn Back Time.” Best retirement party ever. Yeah. No, Glen. I told you, it is what it is. There’s no, all of a sudden, requesting “Half Breed.” All right. Okay, thank you. Bye. Y-Yes. Fine. [ Call ends ]
[ To Sofia ] Do you have any of the really big bags of ice? Miss?
Excuse– Sorry to pry you away from your text or tweet or “twhatever.”
Are you all right?
Oh, my God! Dembe! Look!
Chapel Hill?
Wow, congratulations. Your parents must be so proud.
Thank you. Congratulations.
Oh, my gosh.
This is a moment that woman will never forget. We should buy her something to celebrate.
The clerk was shot and killed.
Well, there was only one robber. The police suspect he was killed by an accomplice who wanted the cash for himself. They’re wrong.
Because I shot him. We shot him– Dembe and I.
 She’d just been accepted to college. The girl, Sofia. Had her whole life ahead of her. All the good and all of the bad. The triumphs and mistakes. Gone. Like a story erased.
We killed the man who committed the crime, but not the man I hold responsible for it.
[ On phone ] Ilya. What’s going on?
Who’s outside?
Listen to me. Stay where you are. I’m gonna send Dembe.
Ilya, Dembe will be there soon. Just keep your head down.
Yes. Blue Chevy again. [ Sighs ] Just drop me at the Post Office. You go make sure he’s okay. When I’m finished with Harold, I’ll call you.
Doing what?
She was an innocent. So many for so long have been innocent. I’m sick of it. 
Federally licensed dealer.
And she gave all 30 to Dalman, the boyfriend.
She can’t be more than 23, 24.
Her? I’m interested in more than her, Harold. You need to take this up the food chain.
For starters, you can make a case against Judson Firearms for selling guns to a buyer they should have known would put those guns in criminal hands.
I disagree. A young woman with an address in the city who’s suddenly decided to collect guns – 30 identical guns. 30 of the cheapest guns on the market, which just happen to be the most popular among young, violent criminals?
How did she pay for them?
Harold.
You want to send her back in, this time, on the record.
It’s okay.
Listen to your wife.
She’s right. You need help. There are people I know who–
I’m sorry I ever dragged you into this. I’m so sorry. 
Too little, too late, I’m afraid. I never should have involved him, let alone her. A whole th–
I’ll be damned. [ To himself and Dembe ] Good for you, Ilya.
I wonder what the hell this means. 
Yes. Elizabeth brought me up to speed.
She did. 
How did Dickens put it? ‘If the law says that, then the law is an ass.’
Frankly, Harold, the thought hadn’t even occurred to me. But now that you mention it, that sounds like a rather splendid idea.
Well, how are you going to do that? By sending me to my room without supper?
Touché.
[ On phone ] Heddie, I need you to reach out to Chuck and Morgan and some of the boys. I believe we have a job to do. 
What do you think?
Agreed. I’ll hang out on the jet. Edward’s gonna make a run to this restaurant he loves – China Moonlight – for some of that tea-smoked duck. You should look at the menu. If everything goes as planned, we’ll be in and out by dusk and have dinner on the flight home. 
[ On phone ] Harold couldn’t leave it alone. No matter. We stay with the plan.
Lucky? There’s no luck in Three Card Monte. It’s a sucker’s game.
I don’t play sucker’s games, and I don’t like to guess. I’ll call you back.
Elizabeth–
I-I know about Harold’s decoys. I need to know which truck has the goods.
Then just listen. Because while Harold may be dedicated to getting this shipment through, I am equally dedicated to stopping it. Not for me or for the poor woman who lost her life to one of these guns but for her mother. Could you imagine your only child just about to go off to college– how proud she must have been? How proud Sam was when you got into the FBI Academy. How proud you’ll be–
Elizabeth, please. Let me get these guns. Hell, we’ll sink the truck in a lake somewhere.
[ To Liz ] Theoretically, one should assume Ressler would drive the shipment. He’s the most experienced field agent, the obvious choice, which is why perhaps it won’t be him.
And Agent Park– she’s new. I don’t know. My hunch is, Harold put the shipment with the badass in the bunch. I think it may be you. Does your truck have the guns, Elizabeth?
[ On phone ] Elizabeth, please.
Listen, you don’t have to say a thing. I’ll count to 10. If it’s not your truck, hang up before I get there, but if it is your truck, stay on the line till after the count of 10. 1, 2–
–3, 4, 5, 6–
–7, 8–
9–
10.
Thank you, Elizabeth. 
[ On phone ] Heddie, what’s happening?
[ On phone ] Heddie, what’s happening? What’s wrong, Heddie?
That can’t be.
You were. Where will you go?
Whoever it was, it wasn’t her. She’s dead.
I’ll look into it. I’ll take care of this. All you need to do is take care of yourself, stay safe.
I want you to come have a seat.
You know, for my entire professional life, I’ve been a fervent and faithful supporter of gun manufacturers. These people take great pride in their history and exquisite craftsmanship. The guns they make are the tools of my trade. In the right hand, that’s exactly what they are. A proper tool. For sport. Protection. Order. In the wrong hands – the hands you put your guns in – they subvert order, tearing communities apart, ruining lives, resulting in tragedy.
I’ve lost so many friends to gun violence. Dear friends.
Yes, yes, of course. You dot the I’s, cross the T’s, and, in your world, those rules protect you. But in my world, there are no laws to hide behind. You can act in bad faith as long as you’re willing to face the consequences.
The wrath of men like me. I object to what you’re doing, and I don’t need to convince any court to agree with me. In my world, if I think you’re guilty – I just execute sentence.
I heard– heard someone else beg at the point of one of your guns. She said please, too. And then she was murdered. Now, I understand it can be hard to see tragedy for what it is until that tragedy befalls you or a loved one. Well, I’m here to tell you that’s happening to you. About an hour ago, a violent criminal bought one of your FineCal 9s on the street for $100, and now that criminal is going to shoot you with it. Tragic.
You seem put out by it. Don’t be. Take it as a compliment.
That he knows you’re a person of conviction and principle.
Yes. He got his.
I acted on my conviction and principle.
I disagree. I find you increasingly clear-eyed. I’m sorry that the Task Force had to take sides today, but it meant a great deal to me to know you were on mine.
Excuse me. Any news?
I understand. [ Hangs up ] [ Sniffs ]
To being on the same side.
The FBI came?
Does he?
[ Sighs ] Excuse me. I’ll see what I can do.
Is it done?
Is it done?
Good. [ Beep ]
Elizabeth knows I’m not Ilya. I wonder what else she knows.
You have a case.
If it’s important to you, then it’s important to me.
 Of course not. That’s what’s so nice about us finally being on the same side of things, same agenda. No subterfuge. What you want, I want.
I am. In fact, I insist. Idle hands and all that. But I would like you to look into something for me.
It’s about Dembe’s– imam.
I don’t know yet. That’s what I need to find out. But first, tell me about this cold case of yours. 
For Tahrir al-Sham?
Along with Imam Asmal. The Bureau didn’t do him any favors by questioning him here in the mosque. Made it appear as if he knew something and might talk.
What was the port of origin?
Ironically, smuggling on a large scale is a profitable yet surprisingly small club. And ever since civil war broke out in Syria, the margins on everything from weapons to medical supplies to narcotics to food going in and out of the country have been particularly bodacious. As such, there’s plenty of room for all the players. Turf has been designated. Territory agreed upon.
A Greek fellow from Queens. A-And Greece. 
Mr. Korba, what a pleasure! Your reputation precedes you. Mine may not, so allow me to introduce myself.
[ Laughs ] My heavens. Is that A5 olive wagyu? I didn’t know you did business in Japan.  Or did these just fall off a truck somewhere on their circuitous journey to Nobu Damascus?
Yes, I’m sure you are. But as it happens, I’m not necessarily interested in your beef. I’m really here to discuss Jalal Abbas and his friends, and whatever they’re bringing into the country from Syria.
On the contrary, I think you’re going to tell me where they are and what they’re smuggling.
I’m not threatening you, Costas. I’m threatening your livelihood. Did you know these cows that gave up their lives to be here today grew up on the island of Shodoshima? And let me tell you, those cows had it good. Frolicking over sun-dappled hillsides, dining on olive peels from Japan’s oldest plantation. I’m told one cow can sell for $40,000, $50,000 wholesale. Rounding down, I’m probably looking at 30 quarters. Given the average rate of cooling, once I kill the AC, you’ve probably got, what, 45 minutes before your half a million dollars of umami-flavored goodness will be worth less than a shinbone.
But you know where they went.
Yes, I understand your feeling of obligation.
Mickey, how long have you been the file clerk for the courthouse? Must be going on 25 years. Shepherding a national database of pleadings and motions, suits and countersuits. Everyone’s dirty little secrets.
Huh. You’re worth it at twice the price. And Pearl is priceless.
Where is Imam Asmal?
How do we get to the basement?
Morgan.
What the hell?
Who are they?
And you have no ties to Tahrir al-Sham.
Harold?
They’re not extremists. They’re humanitarians.
How long do we have before the troops arrive?
[ Sighs ] It’s feeling less and less safe with every second. 
Ah. Please tell me you’re hungry. 
Tonight’s special is wagyu beef.
Counterterrorism division is looking for extremists that don’t exist when they should be looking for Dembe’s imam. His kidnapping is completely unrelated and, as yet, unsolved.
Sakiya said the same. I told her to double-check everything, but– I’m afraid it’s a diminishing return.
It’s hard for him. Especially since he knows I’m to blame.
People close to me are often in harm’s way. 
No. But Dembe is. I don’t think whoever did this is interested in extremists– 
or clerics and refugees. 
I think they’re interested in me. 
Happy ending for them. 
For you, not so much. [ Coughs ] [ Red doubles over ]
 [ Coughs ] [ Inhales deeply ] I’m fine.
[ Coughing ] 
I’m fine.
About my chart.
I’d appreciate if you didn’t mention anything about it to Elizabeth.
What? Everyone knows wine is dehydrating.
Sakiya. Did she find something?
Does she have a lead?
We were wrong. I was wrong. Imam Asmal was not abducted by extremists or because he’s involved with extremists. Dembe knew that, and I ignored his counsel. I can only hope that won’t prove to be a fatal mistake.
One of my cleaners went back over the scene of the abduction, and she lifted DNA from a fingerprint she found on the imam’s desk. Aram, if you would be so kind. Meet Arturo Ruel. His résumé includes two stints at Wallens for carrying out targeted kidnappings in the US and Mexico.
We can circle back to the why after we figure out the how. The two stretches at Wallens? He’s doing one of them right now.
In complete isolation.
It does provide us with quite an engaging riddle.
Yes, I love a good locked-door mystery!
I’d like a list of all the prisoners who have been housed there in the last six months. Ruel may not have had a connection to Imam Asmal, but perhaps someone else does.
Hmm. Where are you on Arturo Ruel?
The chef is a friend. He needed an investor, and I need his pumpkin pepper vichyssoise.
I bought a restaurant because I can. A privilege you will soon enjoy.
[ Laughs ] Chicken soup then. Lobster bisque. Whatever you’d like wherever you’d like it. As soon as the transition is complete.
Of assets. From me to you. I think it’s almost time.
There are quite a few people to be taken care of. Dembe and others. It’s a fairly substantial list, but arrangements have been made. Protocols put in place. Most things will take care of themselves. But there are a lot of assets. Billions of assets. Of which, to a great degree, you’ll be in control.
You’re also the daughter of Katarina Rostova. Believe me, it’s not what I had hoped for, or what I had planned for. But as the good book says, man plans. God laughs.
Destiny. Fate. Me. You.
Marvin Gerard.
Got out three months ago. Haven’t spoken since. Perhaps it’s time to mend that fence. 
Marvin, nobody abandoned you.
You were in prison before I broke you out of prison to come work for me. The only reason you were walking free is because I got you out.
Marvin, what do you want me to say?
Marvin, listen, you went to prison, you kept my relationship with the Task Force to yourself. I appreciate that. I am in your debt.
No. I’m here because I need information about the prison where you served. Wallens Ridge, something’s happening inside those walls, and I need to–
Why not?
I’ll give you money. Whatever you need.
You’re a lawyer. What the hell does moral character have to do with anything?
Marvin, I’d love to help you, and I will, but this–
You’re holding me hostage.
You want me to threaten the Disciplinary Counsel so he’ll certify your moral fortitude.
Look at you. Look. At. You. [ Laughs ]
Al.
Ah, better for seeing you. How long has it been? Must be close to a year.
The crepe suzette. And that fantastic, crazy bassist from Dizzy’s with the shoes and the hair! Oh, my God, what a night!
Ah, honestly, Al, our schedules couldn’t be more out of sync. Imagine the trouble we’d find if you could stay up past nine?
I’m in a bit of a sticky wicket.
No. [ Chuckles ] This time it’s a friend. A lawyer– Well, he was a lawyer. You remember Marvin Gerard?
 I know, I know.
Eh, you know, he–
You haven’t mentioned my blood panel results.
As is Marvin. Prickly, and a good man.
Of course, take your time. Tell her we’re doing everything we can.
A meeting of the minds.
You know Marvin, you know why he’s here. It’s about his license to practice.
 Mr. Wynn, say what you will about Marvin Gerard, and God knows there’s a lot to say. But the man has suffered a great deal of hardship in his life, and through it all, he has remained resolute in his advocacy for and dedication to his clients. His principles and sense of justice have always remained intact. Now, his personality, his demeanor, that’s another subject entirely.
[ Chuckles ] Oh, dear. Listen, for what it’s worth, I once lost a bundle to Al thinking he was bluffing during a hand of seven card stud. He has the sweetest, most child-like face, but my guy Al is as serious as a heart attack. But please, don’t take my word for it. Talk it over with your client. See what’s happening in his neck of the woods. I understand the committee is meeting this afternoon. 
Harold, are you there?
Ha! So, I’m here with an old friend who may have some helpful intel about Arturo Ruel and his mysterious fingerprint.
Well, there’s no better alibi than being in isolation. It only requires a small crew “on the take” to say you’re there when you’re not.
Well, what Marvin is suggesting is that something fishy is going on at Wallens Ridge, so if we’re trying to understand how the DNA of an incarcerated man ended up at a new crime scene while he was in jail, we need to start by looking at Vincent Martin.
He’s the one ultimately responsible for the vanishing of Imam Asmal.
He’s the man with the key to the locked-room.
And they don’t know where the imam is?
My doctor told me to stay away from grapefruit juice.
He said something about statins and how grapefruit affects the metabolic this or that, I don’t know. But whatever the risk, ruby red is worth it. Please, sit. 
Hands.
My name is Raymond Reddington, and as a general rule, innovative is not a word I would use to describe a prison warden. The indignities that the men in your charge are subjected to are cruel and often inhumane. But you – you found a way to monetize that cruelty. I imagine your clients pay top dollar for you to commit the perfect crime on their behalf. Street crimes using men who are off the street. I’m curious how you landed on the idea. The light-bulb moment. I love hearing about light-bulb moments. Do tell. ⋘⋙ That’s an order, not a request.
I guess that just about says it all, doesn’t it? 
Imam Asmal. Who hired you to abduct him? 
Time is of the essence.
Think again.
Maddy Tolliver is dead.
Where did she have you deliver him?
Where. 
Where is she?
No, he didn’t. If he had, they’d be dead already.
You got him?
[ To Dembe ] Did you tell her anything?
We always have a choice.
And you were right, and I was wrong.
Dembe and I have done this dance before. I made it clear there wouldn’t be an encore.
What do you know of my struggle?
Dembe asked you not to.
Thanks can wait. I need you to do something for me.
You’re welcome.
 It’s about my will and my various trusts. Seeing as how she’s the primary beneficiary, I’d like you to set aside a time to review them with Elizabeth.
Regrettably.
Because where she’s going, she’ll need it.
To a very dark and dangerous place.
She doesn’t see it, or can’t accept it, but her path is undeniable.
[ To Gerard ] What did you say?
[ Quietly ] I guess that is what I’m saying. Sometimes there is no choice.
[ To Dembe ] Did you tell her anything?
Regrettably.
Because where she’s going, she’ll need it.
To a very dark and dangerous place.
Who told you this?
[ To Liz ] It’s over. She’s dead. Gunned down in the street less than an hour ago.
That her beloved mother is alive? I’d have to say yes.
[ Groans ]
It’s a beautiful day. You and I are playing well with each other. And I have a case for you. What do you know about the killings this morning in New York?
On an accountant for criminals. He survived and escaped.
His name is Frank Merwin.
No. I want you to find the men who facilitated the accountant’s escape – the Kazanjian brothers.
They provide security to criminals. They’re ruthless and entirely indifferent to the carnage they leave behind.
Even the whisper of a contract with the Kazanjians can deter those with a vested interest from attempting to intervene.
Because apprehending the Kazanjian brothers will take two bloodthirsty killers off the streets while pointing the FBI to the last-known whereabouts of any number of wanted fugitives.
The Kazanjian brothers – Would you care to hear more?
I’m on my way to the restaurant.
With a break in the case?
On what?
I fear she has – a suspicion. 
[ On phone ] Talk to me.
No, Aram, I don’t. If I did, I wouldn’t be asking you, would I?
This isn’t happening. The name, Aram. What’s the name?
[ Dembe ] Stanley Birch. I need you to pay him a visit. 
[ Chuckles ] If we had a valet, you’d walk right in. Without one, you park far away, and by the time you get here, you’ve worked up an appetite. Admit it, you’re a little hungry.
Specialty of the house. I’m never dishonest, only withholding.
And I know you know I’m not Ilya Koslov.
Really? Then why hire a private investigator to prove it?
Stanley Birch – The number from the hotel, it belongs to him.
We go back a ways. Stanley could make a black bear disappear in a snow bank. Whoever is after Merwin, they’ll never find him.
Sensing you wouldn’t bring the Kazanjian brothers to me, I had to make alternate arrangements.
I gave you the case to find Maddy Tolliver. I think she’s alive, and I think she means us all harm – you, Agnes, me, Dom, Dembe, his imam.
What difference does it make?
I’m sorry, are you upset with me?
Don’t put this on me.
That’s not t–
Please. Please. Please, don’t raise your–
It’s not– I-I don’t– Yeah, you’ve never heard–
–me raise my voice. But I’m trying to tell you, this is not my fault.
Do you understand? This is not my f– It’s not– [ Groans ] It’s not my–
It’s– [ Coughs ]
[ Mumbling ] It’s not– It’s not–
I’ve had the most interesting headache. Colors and images. An acid trip – but with pain.
Thank you for getting me here.
Did you?
We were talking about her.
She’s a threat. Or she was.
Wayne Otte. He knows how to find her, and I know how to find him.
[ Exhales ] I should rest.
It’ll be over soon. I promise. It’s for the best.
I need to know where Elizabeth stands. So I put bait on the hook.
Then I know she stands against me.
[ On phone ] Take the win, Harold.
No. I did.
Frank Merwin has information on hundreds of high-value clients. He’s keeping it in a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist as an insurance policy. Find Merwin, and you find his clients’ secrets.
Frank Merwin. The Black Oak helipad in Loudoun County.
And I won’t. You have my word.
The Black Oak helipad. As one of my favorite people likes to say, get there, now.
Okay, I have to confess, you completely fooled me. I mean, I thought she was dead as a beaver hat, with the gunshots and dragging her off and convincing Townsend. To be honest, it didn’t even occur to me the whole thing was an act for me. And what did I do? I bit like a bass on a top-water lure. It was clever. I mean, really clever, guys. Bravo. If I don’t end up killing the two of you, you should maybe consider the stage. Everyone loves a brother act. The Kazanjian Brothers – so vaudevillian.
I want him to show.
You’re not the variable I’m worried about.
I can feel it. She’s not with me. 
Are you my doctor or my conscience?
In my position, it’s not easy to know who cares and who wants to cut your throat. 
Tell me. 
Otte gave you an account number?
So she’s paying someone.
And the Kazanjian brothers?
Elizabeth, I have a lead.
Otte happened.
You sound surprised.
Tell me about Merwin.
Yes. Very. Thanks to you.
No, but you could have. To be honest, I thought you would – call her, take her side. But you didn’t. You took mine.
[ Chuckles ] Happy as a seagull with a french fry.
