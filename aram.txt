Three minutes till the meeting, sir.
Here we go.
They are running her prints.
Okay. Bam!
We lost them.
They seem to be descending, which doesn’t make any sense. The blueprints don’t show any underground space.
Wait! I’ve got something. She’s using the remote mirroring program Meera’s contact gave her. Uh … hang on. This isn’t her computer. It looks like one of the Chinese systems.
Uh … yes, sir, and a lot more than that. Downloading now.
We have the message. The target is Henry Cho.
A civilian.
Here. Immigration says he left China three days ago – a return flight to Dulles airport.
[ On phone to Ressler ] Sir, I’ve got them. The microchip in Red’s neck just came online and the bug we put on Agent Keen. They’re out of the building, moving west on Danforth.
Custom documents indicate Shubie Hartwell entered the country yesterday. We’ve got a credit card in her name that was last used under an hour ago. Purchased two cocktails at the bar in the Key Hotel.
Okay, we’re working on a current address for Zanetakos. Her phone provided a treasure trove of messages. She was in frequent contact with a multinational company called the HanarGroup. But more worrisome is a message that came in today around three hours ago. A call that originated from Berlin.
Agent Ressler! Agent Ressler, we got something you should probably see. The transit authority gave us access to their closed–circuit feeds.
A man carrying a briefcase. He boards the train at Dupont Circle. Four minutes elapse. The same man exits the train at the next station, Woodley Park.
And moments later, at precisely 6:42 a.m – I think we found our delivery device.
Okay.
Bradley Holland just swiped through security at Reagan National.
I’ve got an address on Bradley Holland.
Okay, just got the transponder frequency from American Secure Transport. Target vehicle is crossing over the Queensboro Bridge, Delaware plates. [ Gives license number ]
Okay, turning south. Take the midtown tunnel. You can get ahead of him.
It would have to be hardwired, sir. They’ve knocked out the grids.
Same thing. Unfortunately, it would have to be hacked locally.
Main generator room would give me the best chance. It has all the uplink terminals.
Our backup generator should enable the uplink and allow me to splice a separate signal from the telecom.
Yeah.
[ Enters comms and power room ] Okay. All right. Oh, man. [ Begins typing into control unit ]
[ To himself ] Okay. Let me see.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Agent Keen, it’s me.
I could ask you the same. Where did you come from?
Trying to restore the telecom so we can call in the cavalry.
Captured.
I think Ressler’s in bad shape.
Um, someone called Garrick. He’s disabled telecom, simplex, and duplex signals.
I haven’t been able to hack around it.They are jamming the signal internally.
Uh, based on just the waveform readings and the wattage output, it’s, uh, something powerful, uh, but portable.
All the uplink and communication relays are in the sub garage.
It would automatically reset, yeah.
Uh, yeah. Why?
“We”?
Uh, but I–I–I thought I’m waiting for the signal so we can call the cavalry.
Um, I–I’ve only shot at paper.
Agent Keen.
Okay, I think we’re cool.
Uh, several. But just disabling two should be enough for the uplink to reset and re-establish a signal. Just it won’t be anywhere near full strength.
You might have one bar.
And scarier. But yeah. Faster, right. Sure. Okay. Wait.
Captured. I think Ressler’s in bad shape.
Come on. … Yes. North Arlington Furniture Warehouse.
Uh – Hatchling 5591.
I got the signal out, but I need a dispatch co- [ Sees Garrick’s man, points pistol at him ] Dispatch code Cavalry’s on their way. You’re about to get your ass kicked off the planet, pal.
Wow. I killed him.
Hello?
Agent Keen, are you okay?  [ Hails Cooper: ] Sir! [ To Liz: ] Are you –  Are you with Mr. Reddington?
Do you have a location?
Okay, six blocks west. Turn right at the intersection. Turn right! Right here! Right here! 
Okay, you’re close. He just turned south on 7th. Okay, the signal has stopped moving. He’s right there. He’s in the street.
Agent Keen, did you find him?
We’re done. I’m done.
Liz, this is out of my hands. Okay, assuming –
I could help what would you need?
Supposed to hand off the security feeds to the new team of investigators. I suppose I could make us a copy.
How do you think Ressler’s doing?
Yeah.
I sent you the files. Our cameras cover five blocks around the office in every direction.
Don’t bother. Red wasn’t followed. He came in at 5:15. No tail cars, no eyes on the street.
My question exactly. So I started thinking – What if somebody inside already tipped him off?
No. But I think I have a lead. We routinely collect all cellular transmission from inside and directly around this facility. So much data I had to play around with various mathematical structures, knots, multivariate polynomials –
Right. I found a pattern in the transmissions – a series of calls made from a burner cell. Each call was placed just seconds after Reddington arrived at the post office.
No. All from different burners, but all the calls were to the same number. I vectored the address to a private residence a few miles from here. The address is 8123 12th street.
Excuse me, Director Cooper?
There’s something you need to see.
Of course I do. I shot a man. I thought what I said in therapy was confidential.
Because he’s human?
What – what is this? Where am I?
What? I can’t.
Mr. Reddington, please.
That’s really messed up.♤
Wait. … Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! … I did it. It’s done. Look. It’s untraceable, like you asked.
I used a ripple exchange to have the Fiat currency converted to e–cash and then into Bitcoin. I ran the whole transaction through a randomized cryptographic extension at the protocol level, then through a two–tiered secure laundry service I know I can trust. No one’s gonna catch you. I promise.
I am? I mean, I am! Wait. Of what?♤
Louis who?
You’re not gonna kill me.
It’s from Mr. Reddington. It’s evidence.
Well, yes. He– Uh, yes. Uh, we had a chat – at gunpoint, actually. Long story long, he identified the leak.
The female victim on the plane was named Sarah Jenkins.
The Alchemist knew that, based on a forensic procedure, we wouldn’t run tests necessary to distinguish between synthesized and natural DNA. Now that we know what we’re looking for, we pulled the bone–marrow sample, ran it against our database. Jenkins was single, lived alone, but I did find this. Last time she was online was over 72 hours ago. She visited this dating website, which is also where I met Phyllis Tugenberg and her cankles.
e don’t know, but we’ve issued a subpoena to find out.
We had a few corrupted sectors, but I found something interesting– DNA panels– several, actually. We had already identified Sarah Jenkins as the woman who died on that plane, but I think now we’ve also got the name of Madrczyk’s stand-in, as well as the pilots.
A dozen or so. But I’m sure more will turn up by the time I’ve reconstructed the whole drive.
Some new medical devices operate using radio frequencies If I could ping a signal, I may be able to access it, – and we could –
Do we have a serial number?
I got a hit– signal emanating from a location nearly 70 miles from here.
Excuse me. I found Trettel’s database– the list of criminals he disappeared.
You are looking at Ted Caldwell’s computer, the one we seized from his office. Now, most of it was routine, but deep in the background was a file nobody wanted found.
Not buying. From the looks of it, I’d say it’s something he intended to acquire. I had them printed. It’s a complete dossier – medical profile, grades going back to middle school, athletic and extracurricular interests.
I just talked to the university. She’s in a chemistry class at Regents Hall until 5:00 PM.
Her car’s still there. She swiped in at the parking structure near campus, hasn’t swiped out.
Her cell’s not active. We’re setting up checkpoints, and every law-enforcement agency in a 200-mile radius has her photo, along with the make, model, and plate number of the van.
It’s about Owen Mallory. Cooper said get into his life, so I started with his undergrad degree from Harvard.
Oh, no, he went. Here’s the thing– he went under a different name. Owen Mallory was enrolled as Charles Lassiter Jr. He falsified his transcripts, applied as the only son of Charles and Jill Lassiter from Bethesda.
Okay, here we go.
I will be back in 90 seconds. What’s that?
You know how to palm a phone?
Almost there. Okay, 30 seconds.
We are a go. [ Gives Liz Marwan’s ID ]
We pulled the files of everyone who worked at the depository, and I think we found something. Frank Gordon – a civilian now, but he’s a convicted killer. He now works for a prison–literacy project at their book depository in Monroe, Virginia.
Guys, that Rifkin case you were asking about – the investigating officer was the Senior FBI Agent in Afghanistan at the time – Harold Cooper.
One of the event logs is fake.
Not yet.
Okay, Ruth Suzanne Kipling – single, 62, attended Vassar College, and co-founded the prison rights organization The Amnesty Collective.
Which is how Kipling found out about the entry-log evidence. Okay, I’ve got an address in Mercer County, Pennsylvania.
Uh, we just received word. Uh, Agent Maguire –  I’m sorry. 
Arrived on United 472 from Tokyo. Passed through customs at 11:32 under the alias Yasu Itami.
If I could take a look at that car’s ECU, I might be able to confirm whether it was electronically manipulated.
What’s up?
Hey, guys. This thing was definitely tampered with. The airbag deployed before the crash, not after. There’s a message in the can bus deliberately left here for someone to find.
It’s binary. It spells “Ivan.” His digital signature.
Looks like some kind of RF shielding and a passive satellite tracking system.
That he didn’t repair TVs for a living.
Uh, Agent Keen. I got that information on Jolene Parker’s phone records.
You were her last outgoing call. I was able to pull location data from the cell towers. That’s the address where she called you from – La Vista Street, over in Brookland.
May also be how he learned about the Skeleton Key in the first place. As if that is not enough, he’s also hacked himself access to pay-porn sites and a pile of “Mythcrash” gift cards, which is harder than it sounds.
Harrison was using some serious layers of encryption on his computer, but I was able to find a hidden partition filled with terabytes of data.
Her name’s Abby Fisher.
I’m not sure. Hold on. Doesn’t make sense. All of DC is dark.
The key uses a standard LTE signal, right?
No good. All but one of the city’s towers are offline. Harrison could be anywhere in this five–mile radius.
Uh, one, and it’s pulling a lot of power.
Uh it’s a metro station. Green Line, Branch Avenue.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You’ll need these. [ Tosses something to Liz ]
I looked into the accounts of the two suicide killers, and I found a common thread. Both accounts are receiving funds from a bank in the Caymans notorious for laundering money.
Better. I think I uncovered his payment network. Look at this. Dozens of accounts from all around the world, all receiving some form of payment.
Not all of them. Danny Moss, 54, resident of Dorchester, Mass. sent wire transfer instructions to the same Cayman bank that funds the other accounts.
Congestive heart failure.
Hold on. Hey. Wahid Davi, Dee Torres, and Danny Moss all had life–insurance applications or policies canceled by the same insurance agency, Green Glades.
Uh, units are at Osborn’s house. Wife and co–workers can’t reach him. We found his car at a parking structure near the hospital where he works.
Metro still has no sign of Osborn. Uh, no activity on the Cayman account.
Hey. I got something. Hey. Okay, I never wanted to know this much about gas chromatography or gear lubricants, but I think Mr. Reddington is onto something. Look at this. We pulled the lab reports from the NTSB, and the chopper’s engine tested positive for two distinct compounds. The first is ethephon, which is a ripening agent for tobacco.
I agree, which brings us to chemical compound number two. This one is used to grow sweet corn.
We are looking for a pesticide manufacturer who used to supply tobacco growers but made the transition to corn.
Of those, 11 are outside of the fuel range of this chopper. Uh, of the other six, uh, only one has a structure large enough to get that stolen helicopter out of view and under construction. Halifax Agro–Chem. If I had to bet, I’d say that’s their staging site. It’s around the corner, half a block up.
Archimedes. Archimedes! –
Archimedes’ formula. You know, uh, the the naked guy who shouted “Eureka.”
Archimedes’ principle indicates that the upward buoyant force which is exerted on a body immersed in fluid, – whether fully –
Um, water displacement. 🚤 🚤 🚤
We’ve pulled the passenger manifests and applied the profile you developed a foreign national, male, traveling alone in first class. That narrowed the list down to 47 passengers.
Six of which checked in to the hotels they had listed on their immigration forms. One did not.
JFK, 4:52 PM. And get this we pulled the credit card that our suspect used to purchase his plane ticket into the United States. Forty-five minutes ago, that card was used to book a hotel room in Manhattan.
Listen to this. “Allison is my everything, my moral center. She makes me a better man.”
Agent Keen. I got that surveillance footage you subpoenaed.
[ Keyboard clacking ] What exactly are we looking for?
Whoa. Hold on. Mr. Reddington. Bingo. 4:37 in the afternoon.
Yeah, okay, got it.
One second. Let’s get the get the fuzzies out. Okay. V&M Security.
Hold on. According to V&M’s database, the system is registered to an Albert R Mitchell.
We were able to trace the banking information found in Chandler’s hotel to accounts linked to Chandler. The payments go back to 2007. They’ve been planning this thing for years.
Aram. Hey. Uh, I know you’re, uh, super–busy, but there’s something you said that’s been bothering me. Mr. Reddington left the hospital at 4:37 PM. You said your father died almost an hour later?
I asked the hospital to send over their internal report taken by the active nurse on duty at the time of your father’s death. Your father was found by the hospital staff at 5:30 PM, but the medical examiner estimated he died a little less than an hour before he was found.
I ran every badge from every agency that responded to the incident at Westland Bank Homeland, FBI, FEMA and DCPD.
Searching the preface “UD” turned up nothing. So I widened to HHS, ADSTR, and I got a hit. The only department that uses the preface UD is the Center for Disease Control. “Space Agent 4126” is Dr.Nikolaus Vogel. He lives in Arlington.
Why wouldn’t he just tell us who’s after him?
That’s a great band name.
Sir, I think I have something. Look at this from Vogel’s computer. Your target is Langston Municipal Airport.
Prison transport – eight dead at the scene.
Altimeter readings indicate they were flying below 3,000 feet and along the borders between various air-traffic-control centers.
Um the coroner, uh, just called in the results on the John Doe– the charred body found at the scene. He wasn’t a prisoner.
Oh, no.
No, no. It’s, um, it’s a lexical ambiguity. He cut his hand off.
No. With data analytics.
Yeah. Lord Baltimore is an urban legend. They say he roams the deep web, hunting those who don’t wish to be found. Uses some sort of collection algorithms to build a dossier based on the information that people give away online.
Agent Keen asked me to look for any irregularities in the accounts of employees at the six big data firms.I found several, but this was especially odd: a $250,000 payment that went into Mills’ I.R.A. out to an offshore account.
Okay. Great. But I have something. Our suspect, Mills, she’s telling the truth. Security at Quancord Analytics confirm her terminal was hacked from the outside.
Uh, yeah, like, a gajillion bytes of online data, – which makes no sense.
Not a day goes by where I don’t think about Agent Malik.
Hey, I got something! I got something. Okay, so, the collection algorithms – that Lord Baltimore uses?
No. Turns out Lord Baltimore’s not looking for Mr. Reddington.
Guess who’s no longer Interim Director.
Traffic-police services forwarded their feeds.
Yep. But lousy angle, though. Can’t see what went down inside. But they caught the bad guys coming in and going out. I’m mirroring the feed now. You seeing this?
Not so fast. Check this out.
Yep. Five went in, six came out.
Copy that.
Um okay, uh, four blocks ahead, corner of Stalowa and Srodkowa.
Coffee machine still works.
Mr. Reddington was right. Covington was once a respected surgeon got his M.D. at  Yale, fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery at Vanderbilt.
He had some kind of meltdown. According to this, he falsified a document and stole a set of lungs from the donor pool. Did some kind of experimental operation on a 10-year-old child.
A few weeks later, the guy who was supposed to receive the transplant died. The D.A. considered charging Covington, but he was already off the grid.
Whoa. You’re tall.
I’m from Delaware. No, I– I’m just saying I’m actually half-Jewish. Well, a quarter, really.
Got it. I am processing him through the database now.
But he does have some medical training. Former army combat medic out of Fort Drum.
Bernard Babbitt, known as “B.B.,” runs the  Desobry Syndicate out of New Orleans moving drugs and weapons through the Fourchon.
It’s a digital VoIP line. Uh, man, this thing is getting bounced all over the globe to mask its origin. [Beeping] The line just went active. Covington’s making a call.
Okay, hold on. If he stays on the line just a few more seconds, I’ll have an address.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Damn it. I was only able to narrow his location down – to this five-block area.
Hey. Anything?
Lower level?
The building plans filed with the city don’t say anything about a lower level.
Hey.
I’d, uh, ask if you had a warrant.
Why would I do that? I trust you implicitly, Agent Keen.
Agent Keen had me expedite DNA profiles. All three perpetrators possess the MAO-A 2R gene.
Clinical studies have proven people who possess this gene are prone to aggressive, antisocial behavior.
Already checked that. I can’t break through his firewall. If I could somehow gain physical access, I could upload a program to deactivate it long enough to hack his patient list.
You want a fake medical record?
Like what? 
Who? I’ll bet you $100 she’s telling the truth.
$200?
Hold down power, shift, “s.”
Perfect. Okay. Type forward slash b-n. It’s running a dictionary attack. Should take a few seconds.
Okay, it’s gonna give you a password. I need you to write it down.
You okay? You didn’t get the password.
Okay, there has got to be 70. He was documenting them, searching for the perfect candidates. Hold on. Wait. I have got a hidden subdirectory here.
Except one: Duncan Prince.
I got an address in College Park.
Hold on. Prince’s fake girlfriend posted a very real photo from a community forum on gun violence.
I knew it. Walt’s favorite shrimp is calling my name. Winner buys? See you tomorrow.
Hey.
I followed up on Frank and Naomi Hyland, like you asked. Both phones are dead.
So I identified the five numbers they called the most to see if any of those people were getting calls from new numbers. People that Frank and Naomi might have reached out to.
There’s a woman Monica Lyons. She got six calls today, all unanswered. All came from a pay phone at a gas station in rural Maryland. Only a handful of homes in that area.
2012 Firebomb strikes a Biotechpark in Boston, conducting genomics research, causing $64 million in damage. Four staff members were killed and 16 hospitalized. Ricin was mailed to the Fairbanks BLM Office, which manages Transatlantic Pipeline.
The soil found under the nails of Carrie Ann Beck dates back to the 14th century. It’s called Raw Sienna.
Raw Sienna was used by painters at the time, painters who belonged to what’s known as the Sienese School. The Prado in Madrid has an exhibit going on right now featuring paintings from the Sienese School. Last week, one of those paintings was stolen.
There were 22 paintings at the exhibit. The one that was stolen had been on loan from the Santa Caterina Church in Pisa, and it was, by far, the least valuable.
Not on the back. Under the paint.
Yeah, they used thermal imaging to do microscopic and spectroscopic analysis and found this.
Museum doesn’t know. I spoke with the curator.
I-I don’t know how to break this to you, but, uh, Beck beat you there.
New York Field Office got called in on a grave robbery. According to park police, our guy, Beck, he knew exactly where to look.
Hundreds of years ago. I’m sending you an image of what was left in its place.
We think it’s a marker, some sort of addendum to the map.
It’s ancient Cyrillic. It looks like some sort of equation. “P” equals 100. “O” that sort of looks like a ribbon equals 9. Those dash symbols in between denotes that the number to the right should be multiplied by 1,000. It totals 109,120.
Cubits. Uh, one cubit is half a yard. 109,120 cubits is 54,560 yards. [ Samar gives him a look ] What? I was good at math.
54,560 yards. Or exactly 31 miles.
Mr. Reddington. Um. Hey, uh If you’re looking for, uh, A-Agent Keen –
You want me to find a girl. You can’t tell me her name, and none of the other people who work for you were able to find her.
That’s not much to go on.
Out of curiosity, the other people who couldn’t find her, this girl, um –  W-what What did you do to them?
Agent Keen. Whatever decision you made, I’m sure it was the right one. I’ve seen you under pressure in the moment.
I mean it. The way you handle – take Mr. Reddington, for example. He asked me to do one thing, and I freeze up, – but you’re always able to –
Oh, wait. Uh, no, just, um. You’re solid.
No, forget that. Bad example.
Um [ Breathes deeply ] 
Hey. Full ERT report on Patient Zero’s effects just came in. They found this on the victim’s shirt hair from a rodent, a rat species specifically bred for scientific purposes. Rattus norvegicus. There are only two licensed suppliers for clinical trials. And in the last month, they’ve only had one shipment that didn’t go to a university or research facility.
Two story property in Thurmont.
Vehicle’s owner was one Ron Crocker, boarded a plane to Panama City two hours ago. Liz: Every passenger on that flight will be infected.
Yeah. [ Keyboard clacks ] Okay. Uh, one-way ticket, traveling alone, no checked baggage. Ticket purchased within the last eight hours.
Okay, 31 matches. Of those, seven are business travelers who made last-minute reservations using corporate cards.
All but one, Chris Perez. Leaves Dulles for Toronto within one hour.
We’ve located four of the suspects. Two land in 45 minutes: Moscow and SaoPaulo.
We have to assume the passengers are all infected. Quarantine won’t help them, only the cure.
Looking. Looking now.
 Okay. Come on.
That’s him. There he is. A black jacket with a gray hoodie, a green shoulder bag. Near gate C-13.
 I was able to trace a credit card tied to the plane tickets Beck purchased, but he created a VPN. The computer he used accessed the Internet within a 50-mile radius of Abingdon.
[ Mumbling ] Yeah, uh [ Dialing ] …  Mr. Reddington, I-I’m calling about Agent Keen.
You have? I mean, uh, you have. That’s so –  That’s fantastic. But, uh, that’s actually –  That’s not why I’m calling. Uh, Agent Keen, she and Agent Navabi, they’ve been infected.
Just over an hour ago.
He’s somewhere outside Abingdon, but I don’t know where. I’ve searched the public record. Uh, tax bills, power, phone. It’s like – It’s like he lives off the grid.
Have what? [ Beep ] 
[ Breathing heavily ] Hey. Uh, I figured it out. Technically, Mr. Reddington figured it out, but I think I know where Beck is. He’s a radical environmentalist, so any electricity would be solar. We have a 50-mile search area.
Using grid-tied power. But people who want to sever ties with the government, they would use off-grid systems, which are very uncommon.
I could only find one with the capability to support a compound large enough for Beck and his followers. Um, I should mention I’m pretty sure Mr. Reddington has a head start.
It’s a lot.
[ Beeping ] Whoa, oh, flag up. Looks like we got another one. Pulled up this morning in a fisherman’s net in Hokkaido, Japan. – same M.O, skinned. A local M.E. I.D.’d him from the serial numbers found on an artificial hip Alejandro Gomez, Bolivian.
According to Bolivian police and WCS, rumors are that Gomez worked for –
Taking into account estimated time of death, I– I’ve programmed a simulation illustrating point of origin by running the tidal and ocean-current data for the dates our two floaters washed up in Japan and Russia. Check it out. [ Awesome graphics ] The orange one is Gomez. And as you can see, both bodies were dumped somewhere off the coast of Sitka, Alaska.
Paris two hours after Batouala disappears, a chartered Citation [small jet], CJ3S, leaves a private airstrip outside the city. Sao Paulo another Citation departs 45 minutes –  after Alejandro Gomez is abducted.
Well, I got two different names here, but both check out as bogus, so I’d say yes.
Right. So I checked local airports and got a third hit. [ Keys clacking ] Another citation, which departed yesterday from Westchester at 5:12 p.m.
Bogus. Uh, all over the map – Uh, Tokyo, Dubai, Paris.
Three separate jets, three separate companies. One domiciled in Oslo, uh, the second in Belgium, uh, the third in South Africa. But they all share a common corporate parent Or should I say a common corporate “second uncle cousin sister once removed”? 
D.O.D. discovered a hidden surveillance camera at their Annapolis field office during a routine sweep.
Technology was Iranian.
Okay, uh, the camera was placed outside the building with eyes to the front entrance. It was relaying a live stream to some off-site location. If I reactivate it, I should be able to triangulate the location where the feed’s being transmitted. Um. Oh, man. I almost forgot. [ covers camera aperture on computer ] In case someone’s watching on the other end. [ Whistles ] Okay. Camera is live. Okay, RDF is up. Signal strength looks good. Oh, accounting for time lag. [ Beeping ] And we have a lock. It’s a property just outside New Carrollton, and it looks like it’s a construction site.
Sir, I think we have a problem. I can’t reach Agents Keen or Ressler.
We’re seeing multiple 911 calls within the last hour. They all report a black S.U.V. overturned just under a mile from where they picked up Reese. Cross-reference with local police activity. Two passengers were pulled from the wreck and evac’d by ambulance to Bethesda National.
Uh, sir? Just got off the phone with Bethesda National. Uh, the hospital has no record of Agents Keen or Ressler being brought in.
Cooper went to secure Professor Collins. Uh, I traced the call Liz made to Cooper’s cell.
Cooper’s pulled six teams from other assignments. He sent them –
I’ll contact the FSB.
Yes. The Russian crime lab reported finding epithelial cells on the lip of a coffee tin found in the debris.
Uh, the reports I.D.’d the explosive device as Semtex. Same explosives a bomber used to down Pan Am 103 by hiding the explosives
Only a DNA profile, which was useless 20 years ago before they had a database to run it against. But today.
So if you cut the collar off, you interrupt the circuit and bang?
Why would Mr. Reddington want to get captured?
That place is real?
This place is a slaughterhouse for spies.
He stole $282 million from Baghdad in the middle of Operation Shock And Awe, abducted a CIA asset out of Iran during the ’09 election protests. Later, he sold his secrets to Beijing.
Sir! Uh, sir, we have a situation. Uh, we’ve lost contact with Agent Keen.
Uh, nothing since after they touched down. I reached out to Langley. The entire facility is dark.
We’re gonna give the code, right? Sir, I’m sorry, but you have to give the code. It’s a black site. Nobody will know we’re negotiating.
We’re gonna give the code!
Sir, Braxton’s back online.
I have attacked this from every angle. Once Braxton reboots the servers on his end, he’ll have full access to the intelligence network.
Our DOD satellites shutting down A temporary loss of real-time field communications.
And assuming we could even get authorization to do that, it would take hours to shut it down.
Sir, you got to see this. I just got confirmation that two F-22s were scrambled out of Wright-Patterson. They seem to headed toward The Factory.
Twenty-four minutes.
[ Beeping ] Sir, I just got word. The missiles have been launched. Impact in 30 seconds.
Satellite imagery confirms The Factory’s been hit and is burning. All communications are down. No audio or video in or out.
Sir, I’ve been monitoring flights in and around the Norton Sound with proximity to The Factory. The FAA picked up an aircraft entering Juneau airspace ID’d as a private medevac chopper. The FAA doesn’t require flight plans or passenger manifests for medevac choppers.
Grace River Hospital.
Sir, the Coast Guard– they’re picking up a signal from The Factory. That’s some kind of SOS.
Sir, sir, I think I found a doctor with a connection to Braxton. [ To Samar, hugs ] You’re safe.
Uh, w– uh, what about Mr. Reddington?
Yes, right. Uh, sorry. Okay. Her name is Dr Selma Orchard. She’s an attending in neurology at Walter Reed and was part of a team that discovered a gene that makes it possible to erase memories.
Yeah, the gene is known as TET1, and it’s critical to a process called memory extinction, where painful events are replaced with more positive associations. She was at Walter Reed.
First Gulf War. He was part of a friendly fire incident with multiple casualties in Khafji. I assume he brought this home with him. Orchard must have treated him at some point for this.
Nowhere. Uh, if Braxton did abduct her, he didn’t leave a trace.
I don’t know. It was –
Where’d you get it?
There are people who are far more qualified at this kind of thing than me.
No. No.
I think I left my soup in the microwave. Lobster bisque. [leaves]
Richard Gagnon, Executive VP for a French video-component manufacturer. Here he is before he was taken [ Keyboard clacking ] and here he is the day SRU released him in exchange for $2 million cash.
I’m sorry, but people’s faith is sacred. Religion should be off-limits to spies. Wouldn’t work in my country.
Hey.
No. I mean, uh, yes. Looks like some kind of beta technology. A recording device.
Have you spoken to Mr. Reddington about this?
But he might have some insights.
Mum’s the word.
Kenyon declared it a nation-state and petitioned to secede in US District Court three decades ago.
The VIN numbers on the van’s differential match a vehicle registered to Kenyon’s Church of the Shield.
Also, the plates were swapped out for one stolen off a Cherokee at a truck stop five miles down the road from the Kenyon compound. I got a hit on another set of plates stolen from the same location. Another van passed through a tollbooth on the MD 200 headed into DC.
Oh, my God. l– coroner’s preliminary report on the massacre at the compound.
Not a shot was fired. Every single one of those people was stabbed, strangled, stomped, or bludgeoned to death.
And something else. A field office in Richmond just got a call from a former cult member –  Dawn Weston. Swears our truck bomber is her son.
I can’t raise Liz or Ressler.
Uh, Agent Keen, uh, the ME called. He just finished his autopsy on the latest victim.
Oh. Uh – Thank you.
I pulled the forensics like you asked and had the lab compare the bite marks left on each liver for the first six kills with those from the last six.
Right. Uh, turns out, the, uh, distance measurements on the upper arch are 2.8% wider in the first six victims than in the second six.
The last victim’s wife, the one you let stew, apparently you did a really great job, because she is boiling over.
Just got off the phone with her. She wants to talk.
Oh. [ Chuckles ] No one ever calls me that.
I need a warrant.
Of course I won’t need a warrant.
Yes.
I’ve been screening service providers – uh, therapists, lawyers, doctors, anyone who’s worked with the wives of our copycat’s victims.
Right, but I got nothing. Then I took a look at Whitehaven’s employees and volunteers. At one time or another, all of the victims’ wives reached out to one of Whitehaven’s affiliates for assistance.
All but one. In every case, their husbands were murdered by the copycat after they sought help, except her – Tracy Solobotkin. Her husband was the first victim of our copycat, and she was hired over three months after his death.
Maybe she wanted to help women who were still in bad relationships.
Says here she works in accounting, which would give her access to the names of every woman who got assistance from Whitehaven.
Dembe … Uh, yes … Uh, Mr. Reddington said I should call as soon as I traced the call … Uh, yes, I have an address. Uh, 3130 Sheridan Road, Park Slope.
What?
[ Chuckles ] No. Did you think I–
I’m not going bald. I just – I have a high hairline. Wait, what? Did you just say that –
I think I might have something. I isolated this image from the pics, ran it against our known-tattoo database, and got a hit. Silvio Haratz, a Brazilian-born kidnapper working the world’s K&R hotspots. If the auction’s gonna be held on US soil, Haratz is headed here.
The DOJ has an active file on Haratz, but it’s restricted access. I can’t open it without throwing up red flags in the Attorney General’s office.
The Kings have real-estate holdings all over the world. You’d have to be invited to know where this thing is.
He can’t. But his new acquisitions emissary, Josephine Sullivan, flew in from LA this morning. She just checked in to The Vanguard.
Sir, uh, we may have a problem. I was checking with DOC on Josephine’s transfer to Hazelton.
No. We do. I’m just finalizing some of the translations. Just a few more seconds.
Please tell me you made that up.♤
Okay. Here we go. According to our assets in Dresden, you are looking at the leadership structure of Die Entrechteten.
These guys are fighting a street war. Interpol estimates at least a dozen drug-related homicides in the last year alone.
I can check, but I don’t think we have any friends on the inside.
I’m collecting signatures for a get-well card for Mr. Cooper.
Too much? I just thought – I mean, I wanted to make him laugh, you know? I mean, if it’s serious.
She did? And is it bad? It’s bad, isn’t it?
Low blood sugar?
Wow. Guess I don’t need the card anymore.
A birthday card and 31 red-velvet cupcakes. Uh, well, uh, 30. I couldn’t resist. When are you coming back?
Work. Right.
 That might actually be a problem. According to his recent credit-card activity, Lloyd Munroe just bought a bus ticket out of Buffalo on the Silver Line.
He joined Sadovo Solutions in 2005. It was a biotech company in Chapel Hill. Mostly worked on the research side. He was an endocrinologist.
Because it’s kind of like he did. The guy’s a ghost.
Wait a sec. Get this–  Sadovo Solutions, the biotech company that Powell worked for before he disappeared, guess who owned it.
I think I can help with that. Been going over the files we recovered from Powell’s facility, and check this out–
Yes and no. All of them are deceased except for one, the woman on the bottom right.
Guys, check it out. The detectives and the lawyers may not have found anything conclusive on their own, but if you put the photos they found together – Our ghost has a face.
Okay, so, I have this friend, Osborne, in the forensics lab – Freaking Osborne.
Right. So, I scanned over 40 partial prints Conway’s investigators found at his ranch, another 53 partials found by Mrs. Salinger’s private detective. I fired them off to Osborne. He is a wizard with whorls, loops, and arches. He managed to stitch together three partials into a gorgeous, crystal-clear left thumbprint. Ran it through AFIS, and bang. Her name is Vanessa Anne Cruz – 36 years old. Last known address – Her mother’s place in Edison, New Jersey.
Guys? It looks like this isn’t the only way Vanessa Cruz has used shelf companies. At least six other victims were all accused of funneling money through shelf corporations they say they didn’t know existed.
Hang on. Did you say dozens of files? This goes way beyond the names Mr. Reddington gave us.
Trace evidence to be planted at crime scenes.
And?
Wait. The evidence you found in Cruz’s loft suggests she’s been targeting dozens of victims.
I called Carlton’s office, and nobody’s picking up. His cell is going straight to voicemail.
Which means she’d have the keys to the kingdom – Passwords, financials, credit cards. There’s a hit on Mason Carlton’s Amex. He reserved a room for tonight at the Wolverton Hotel.
I’m trying to ping Agent Keen’s phone now.
There’s nothing on him in the system.
Well, he didn’t tell me what it was for, and I, uh, definitely didn’t ask, but I could probably still pull up the location.
The shooter at the first crime scene, the EMTs who were taking him to the ME, they never showed.
 He wasn’t in their system.
Last-known photograph dates back to 1981.
He may as well have been a ghost.
Their passports were forged using fictitious names just like the documentation that Mr. Reddington provided on Marjorie Lin.
And all of them were shipped back to various cities in China.
And we’ll find out. As soon as our suspect files the paperwork authorizing the transportation of Lien Mah back to China, we’ll know the flight number, and we can go seize the casket and see for ourselves.
Lien Mah’s body was just delivered to Dulles. The casket’s scheduled to be on Flight 241 to Beijing.
Guys, come here. Check this out. The photo on the left was taken by the coroner who pronounced Marjorie Lin dead five days ago. The one on the right was taken at the airport yesterday. Notice anything?
Bingo. When she died, Marjorie Lin didn’t have veneers.
That is not easy to pull off, given the time frame. Process normally takes weeks. Ms. Lin’s body was only taken two days ago. According to Danover Labs, the order was delivered to a Dr.
You’re standing in front of a ghost bride.
It’s an outlawed folk custom. A Chinese form of ancestor worship. When a family member dies, the surviving relatives are obligated to tend to that person’s needs in the afterlife. And if they die unmarried, they’ll find themselves alone on the other side. And unhappy spirits tend to come back and haunt their living relatives.
The ceremony. The family crafts a doll for the deceased groom, as well. After which, the female’s remains are buried alongside the deceased male. Believe it or not, even with all the women in China, young, attractive, unmarried female corpses are rare, which would explain why our suspect was exporting bodies from the U.S.
Mail-order corpse brides.
I analyzed the money you found in the ceiling tile and found a couple of anomalies. Turns out the cash is worth a lot more than the 100 grand the bills represent.
All the serial numbers start with a888, and none of them include the number 4. In, uh, Cantonese and most regional Chinese dialects, the word for “four” sounds like the Chinese word for “death.”
It is statistically impossible to have this many bills and not have any fours, unless, of course, the bills were printed specifically without any fours.
I’m saying they’re prosperity notes, worth about 5 bucks to every dollar. And there’s only one place you can buy an entire batch of currency with this sort of customized detail.
I already contacted the Treasury. The buyer was one Mr. ChaoXiang Han. Uh, Kenda. Uh, I looked into this guy, and – Thanks so much – And we found this article published last February.
Uh, wait, but isn’t she supposed to already be dead? Isn’t that how this works?
I’ve scrambled the local P.D. to An Bai’s house. They should get there before you do.
No answer on her cell. I’m gonna try her on her home line now.
Ms. Bai? My name is Aram Mojtabai, and I’m an agent with the FBI. We have reason to believe you’re in danger.
I’ll explain, but first, I need you to find a secure room in your house. Make sure all the doors and windows are locked. The police are on their way, and I’m gonna stay on the line until they arrive.
Ms. Bai. Hello? Ms. Bai? Hello? Hello, are you still there? Ms. Bai?
Oh, my God.
I got something. Security cam from a loading dock on 20th and Independence.
Hey, guys. Listen to this. From the recording Agent Masik gave you.
Whatever’s happening, it is happening soon.
Could be referencing map coordinates, some kind of radio beacon. We don’t know.
We reviewed ownership records for all the Russian restaurants in DC and found one. Samar: Ninoshka’s. The owner is former Spetsnaz. His name is Anton Velov. My belief is he’s the CI.
The conversation was recorded last night, so we pulled all the receipts and found a late dinner for two paid for by a Leo Andropov.
I’d say yes. Andropov worked for the Soviet Defense Ministry in the final months before Glasnost. [ Indistinct shouting; lab being stormed ] Whiz kid. When he was 16, he published his first and last paper in an open-source microbiology journal before he got snapped up by the Weapons Ministry.
I can tell you what I’m dealing with– an impossible problem. So if you’re counting on me cracking this virus, don’t.
We found the formula for the virus in Karakurt’s apartment. So my plan was to reverse engineer the process. We are trying millions of DNA combinations. If I could figure out the profile it was engineered to destroy–
Except it won’t work – not in time, at least. I need hours – days, maybe – and the memorial will be over long before we can ID the target sequence.
This is Aram.
Okay, that’s not gonna be so easy to put together.
Okay, I hear you, but you have to– Whoa. Whoa. Bethesda General sent tissue samples to the CDC a few days ago. A suspicious death of a college student. The Center’s just starting an investigation.
The Crime Lab just called. They’re saying his blood tested negative for the virus.
We pulled all the receipts and found a late dinner for two paid for by a Leo Andropov.
Sorry to interrupt. Agent Keen’s blood test just came in. She tested positive for the virus that killed Senator Hawkins.
Team, our power supply’s not responding.
For the record, I believe Agent Keen is innocent.
You agree with me, right? About Agent Keen?
Well, it is Mr. Reddington.
DCFD is responding to a vehicle fire in Columbia Heights. It looks like the transport vehicle used by Mr. Reddington’s people.
Nope. We’ll try and recover the VIN numbers on the transport and any vehicles it may have been carrying, but right now, the fire’s too hot, so it looks like they got away. Which is, you know, terrible news.
I can. Yes. If you can look me in the eye and promise me Agent Keen will get a fair hearing if we do.
Come on, that’s not good enough.
What a jerk.
Yeah, well, there’s only one fact about Mr. Cooper that matters– he’s a decent man.
I think we got something. Picked it up online. Twitter photo. Posted it two minutes ago, taken in the Shaw Neighborhood at 9th and Q.
Okay, I’ve got something. A call to the tip line. A CCTV feed and three tweets all indicating Mr. Reddington and Agent Keen are moving north/northwest on Foxhall Road past Reservoir.
Hang on, I have a sighting in Adams Morgan. Wait, wait, no.
Okay, MSNBC’s home page just uploaded video of them at Michigan Park. Hold on, this can’t be right.
All right, my screen– my screen’s blowing up here. I’ve got them in Brookmont, but the tip line has them in Palisades.
I have no idea. I’ve got them in five different parts of the city all at the same time.
Wait, is that true?
Uh, yes, rolling all available agencies. Uh, Mr. Reddington and Agent Keen can’t be in all of these places, but they must be in one of them.
Okay, we’ve got a sighting. Del Rio Diner, 1425 Peabody Street.
He can’t do that, can he?  Can you do that?
I found the 9-1-1 call.
I know how Mr Reddington and Agent Keen got out of the diner where the standoff happened. The tunnels, the ones they used to escape from the diner, they were built to sneak in contraband from the port of Baltimore.
Already did. One particular freighter caught our attention.
According to the cargo manifest, only one thing came off the ship. Container number 358202 was offloaded and placed on a westbound flatbed at 12:23 AM.
I found on the AP. A bombing in Fairfield at a facility owned by Verdiant Industries.
I thought the same thing. So, I cross-referenced every senior-level employee with Mr Reddington’s file, and I came up with one name. Verdiant CTO Susan Hanover.
Because it was listed in the Fulcrum. 25 years ago, Hanover was a low-level staffer on the Hill.
You stumbled on a state-of-the-art virology shop. Matchett didn’t steal Verdiant’s genome blueprint so he could release it publicly. He needed it to identify its weaknesses and design a virus tailor-made to destroy it.
90% of all corn grown in America is genetically modified, and Verdiant is the largest producer of it. In fact, this one strain is planted all over the world. If this virus gets out, it will spread fast.
It would cross state lines in weeks, maybe even days. Within months, it would migrate overseas. If Matchett unleashes this virus, we could have a global food crisis on our hands.
I just received a cache of internal research documents from Verdiant. Definitely not the kind of stuff they’d want out there.
That’s the crazy part. They came in on the fax hard line. I think from Agent Keen. I think she wants us to search a Verdiant warehouse in Silver Ridge.
Are you sitting down? Because you are not gonna believe this.
What? What happened?
Who are–
[ Chuckles ] What are you doing in my apartment? And, uh, who was that guy?
Where’s Agent Keen? Something’s happened to her, hasn’t it?
[ Laughs ] I’m so happy to see you.
If I agree to help I’ll have to let Agent Ressler know.
He wouldn’t take it from Tom.
He knows you’re in trouble. He came and offered to help, and Agent Ressler turned him down.
I had no knowledge of this. I walked in, and they were just there.
I live at the Nottingham apartments.
Uh, Mr. Reddington asked me to.♤
Because he needs our help finding The Djinn.
[ To team ] The kidnap and rape of a British princess. The mauling death of a big-game poacher locked in a lion’s cage. The vivisection of a drug dealer while he was eaten alive. According to Mr. Reddington, these are not random acts of perverse cruelty. Each was a revenge fantasy, planned and providing by a woman known only as The Djinn.
All I know is, they believe she can help clear Agent Keen’s name. The Djinn apparently grants your deepest, darkest wish. If you can imagine it and pay for it she’ll make it happen.
Right. At the early days of the web, a virtual fantasy world ♤ was created online to connect people of all ages from around the world. The technology was quickly obsolete, but the site was never taken down. Today, it is a hidden oasis for freaks and weirdos. No digital signatures. Tor-encrypted on the dark web. It offers anonymity for new clients to contact The Djinn. Once you locate her avatar, The Djinn invites you into a private room, where you give her your name and bank account. That’s it. You sign off. The Djinn verifies your financial resources. If she likes what she sees, she contacts you directly to set a meeting.
That is Bahram Bakhash, owner and CEO of Azeri Financial.
I figured it out. I had to go through six pass-throughs and two loan-outs in The Caymans, but –
Oh. Um You look nice today.
Right. The Newcastle Venture Group– Nasim Bakhash controls it.
And the board of Azeri Financial just approved the buyout offer.
That’s good, because a 911 call was just placed from Nasim’s home, and the caller was Mr. Reddington.
Voice analysis confirmed it.
Any known aliases?
The only hit on our forensics database is this.
Thank you for letting us protect Agent Keen.
Mr. Reddington?
Agent Navabi is en route. NYPD is confirming two fatalities.
No. Oh, uh, God, no. Agent Keen stole a car, abandoned it 10 blocks from the scene.
Uh, that, you know, I’m not really supposed to talk about.
According to Mexican authorities, the gun he used in one of the cold cases was made by a master gunsmith named Zachary O’Toole, AKA Zed. Uh, we haven’t been able to locate him.
NYPD is still trying to confirm the victim was Wendigo, but traffic cameras in the area confirm that Mr. Reddington and Agent Keen were in the vicinity. Also, agents on scene forwarded a hard drive they found in the unsub’s apartment. Check this out.
An advertisement for a hit man.
Not just Wendigo. They’ll be others. That’s the scary part. This isn’t a contract. It’s a bounty on the darknet. “Wanted – dead not alive.”
Someone with the screen name “Arioch Cain” put a price on her head. Now any nutjob who kills Agent Keen will collect the money if he can prove he did it.
By submitting the date, location, and method of execution, plus a unique identifier. Wendigo’s was Psalm 1:1.
It is decentralized, cached on servers all over the world. I take one down, two pop up.
No. See, the person who put her on the site didn’t put up the money.
Haters – people who believe what they read about Agent Keen. They make Bitcoin donations – the miracle of crowdsourcing turned on its head to crowd-fund murder. The more notorious the target, the bigger the fund, and the more people who will try it. We thought Wendigo was bad. This is way worse. There’s no limit to how many assassins could be coming after her.
This is the site creator? You’re Gavrilo Princip?
Agent Navabi?
I thought you were great. Maybe I can talk to him.
Look, Gavin  Mr. Delgado, we both know you can take that site down.
If you don’t take Agent Keen off your site –
Actually, I was thinking more like millions of repetitive requests.
I know your dark web P2P is cached on multiple servers, but I’ve got a virus concealed via rootkit. Delgado: [ Laughs ] Look, I’m way ahead of you. There’s a reason people trust me enough toput millions in my site.
Because they know you can’t take the money and run.
I thought I could. I thought, uh –
Yes, but it is a two-key system. He is only one of the keys. The other key is this Arioch Cain, the person who put her on the site, and I can’t find him unless I can follow the money, and there is no money to follow until the bounty is put in escrow. Mr Reddington, I am so sorry, but the only way they’re taking Agent Keen’s name off the site is if she’s dead.
Uh, I’m sorry. Bad connection. Did you just say we’ll have to kill her?
When you do, Arioch Cain will enter his passkey to release the bounty.
Agent Ressler knows what we’re doing, right? I mean, he knows about Agent Keen?
He is not gonna like this.
Okay, tell me what you see.
Perfect. Okay, Delgado’s admin site should automatically release the funds into escrow. When they do, Wendigo should get an e-mail with a link to a routing number. Now, the actual funds won’t be available for 32 hours, but the routing number can be back-traced to give us an address.
Read me the routing number.
I thought you’d be furious.
Hang on. I think I may have a lead on his next victim. This is Dr. Richard Kucera, chair of Mathematics at a university in Bacelona. Dr Kucera disappeared two days ago.
Exactly. Thing is, there’s only one female Chair of Mathematics who’s at the same level as Dr Kucera, and she is here in America. Her name is Anna Neehoff. Currently on Sabbatical. Living in Arlington, 6234 Norwood Drive.
Crandall Cryonics is a legitimate firm that specializes in cryogenic preservation. It’s more hope than science, but true believers think it’s possible to freeze the human body, suspend death and disease so that patients might be reanimated and cured when new technology is developed in the future.
According to the FAA, he’s landed 30 times in the last three years. Each time corresponded to the date of an abduction. He was scheduled to land today but scrubbed that less than an hour after we prevented Anna Neehoff from being taken,
His plane is an ark.
No it’s an A 380. Definitely big enough to contain a mobile lab and store multiple corpses.
We found ’em. NSA satellite picked up an A380, descending, on course for a regional airstrip outside Halifax.
Apparently not.
NSA intel indicated that’s where the plane was heading, uh. It’s not. It’s landing near Pittsburgh.
I set up an air traffic control alert for Crandall’s transponder, figuring when he moved through restricted airspace he’d have to turn it back on. The alert says Pittsburgh.
I could hear you guys yelling from down here.
So, is he in or out?
Already on it. Well, uh, agent Navabi is. Mr. Reddington called her, claiming to know who’s responsible for the Lazarum abductions. 
This is the only photo of Hasaan. It was taken four years ago by an agent named Avi Lebov. Three minutes after this image was captured, the vehicle Hasaan exited detonated, killing Lebov and 12 civilian bystanders.
We know Hasaan was involved in dozens of attacks, but there are others where his role has yet to be confirmed. Those include the Pishin bombing in Iran.
Forget that. We are doing it for you, for your brother. We’re doing it, right? [ Cellphone rings ] Agent Mojtabai. When? Okay, got it. Thanks. [ To Samar and Ressler ] A video was just sent to several news outlets. It was turned over to the bureau a few minutes ago.
[ To Ressler ] Sir? Sir? That guy Sweatervest. [ The guy is with the Director ] A year ahead of me at M.I.T. Won the Sprowls Award for his thesis on default-deny firewall security. C.I.A. recruited him as a sophomore. Never gave me the time of day. Ever. Like, ever-ever.
A phone number. Sweatervest is running a tap on it, which I know, because I got around his firewall and accessed his computer. Which, despite being a felony, feels amazing. Maybe he got Liz’s new cell, or, you know, maybe Mr. Reddington’s?
Without a warrant, that would also be a felony. But yes, absolutely.
Oh, my God. Brilliant. Nice one. [ Clicking on keyboard ] All right. That’s Sellinger Power. They operate at a facility outside of Bethesda.
They set a meeting. One hour at a restaurant called Wing Yee.
Yes. And it appears he is sending a team.
Sir, sorry to interrupt. It’s about Agent Navabi.
About Agent Navabi. It is urgent.
Agent Navabi –
She’s– she’s okay. That was her. She’s okay. [ Sighs heavily ] 
Hey. Reven Wright’s waiting for you in Mr. Cooper’s office.
Want me to log it into Evidence?
You missed a button.
Yo.
Actually, can I ask you something? Agent Ressler– this is his laptop. He asked me to run a search history.
Why wouldn’t he know what was searched on his own computer? He just said as soon as I figured it out, let him know.
Why can’t I do that?
You know where they are, and you’re not gonna tell him.
Why use Agent Ressler’s laptop?
I get it. I totally get it. Whatever you need. Mum’s the word.
I did.
Protocols– what are they?
They’re in West Virginia. The search traced Mr. Reddington’s burner to a location outside of Davis Creek.
She couldn’t, after Mr. Reddington helped with her brother.
It’s not? You said–
Hey. You okay?
Anything I can do?
I know, and I am sorry, but you lied. You said Agent Ressler’s laptop was on your work station, and we both know that is not the truth. The IP address where your search originated– it was Agent Ressler’s apartment early this morning. Way early, so–
Yeah. Me too.
I search-traced Mr. Reddington’s burner to a location in West Virginia.
Agent Mojtabai.
Mr.Reddington.
Me? Um, okay.
How?
You promised me that Agent Keen would receive a fair hearing.
How do you know?
Okay, okay. Uh, glass half-full. There’s someone who can save Agent Keen?
Go. She’ll be fine. You know better than anyone, they can’t break in there.
They won’t.
I’m the one who changed it.
Okay.
Hey. You okay?
Okay, you’re almost there. In an hour, Ressler will move you to a holding cell at the courthouse. You’ll be safe there.
That must be –
What’s happening to her?
Okay, breathe slowly and steady.
Nitrogen. He’s pumping nitrogen in through the vents. It would– Oh, my God, it would strip the oxygen out in minutes. You wouldn’t be able to smell it either.
Oh What, are you guys just gonna watch this happen? She can’t breathe.
He is not, and you know that! Do something. Do something! Okay, right. Okay, Agent Keen. Okay, hang on. I’m just– I’m gonna see if I can access – the ventilation system from my terminal.
Okay? It’s, um, it’s gonna be okay. I’ll be right back.
Oh, my god. Liz, I have to let you out.
Please!
To video monitor: Damn it, are you even listening? I- I’ll go to the press. I don’t care! There are witnesses here. I will tell the world what you’re doing here. Fix the air! 
Hang on, Liz. Come on, you have to. Come on, a little longer. Come on. Liz? I, uh, I’m afraid we’re out of options. Can’t seem to figure out what’s wrong with this air system. Liz. Liz? [ Clatters ] Liz? Wake up! Liz! Navabi. [ Sobs ]
Come on, Liz. Come on, Liz.
Yeah, yeah.You’re okay. Liz. I’m – I’m sorry. I’m sorry. So much sorry.
[ Points gun at the Director ] I won’t let you take her.
[ Breathing raggedly ] I don’t care.
No, I didn’t. [ Breathing heavily ] I opened the door.
There’s nobody down there.
So then why did you ask me to meet you at an empty grave?
Um, be careful with that. I’m not due for an upgrade– 
Okay, I, uh, really, really do not like that guy, and I- I want to be a-a team player and all, but this sounds a little like–
You were in therapy?
Wait.Uh, wait, we must be on the wrong floor. I thought you said this is where the Director and his wife get therapy.
Yeah, I still don’t get it. If his office is on the sixth floor, why are we on the eighth?
Whoa.
Oh, that is so cool. Sleight of hand. I love magic.
But, uh, the real trick is going to be getting the Director here in the first place.
Okay.
Mr. Reddington, be advised [ Whirring ] Director arriving on the eighth floor in five, four, three, two [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Director notices bowl of apples ]
We love you, Agent Keen.
Hang on. I got a flag on him. Georgetown address.
Whoever he is, he has got Intel on nearly every blacklister Mr.
Okay, Macnamara, Janet P. Uh, she runs the FBI’s Human Intelligence Unit.
Okay, she’s not at work. She’s picking up her son at a piano lesson. 41st and Macaroy in Hyattsville.
If you could remove your jacket.
Which is why we’ll be deploying the latest surveillance tech from the CIA.
The transmitters run on a delay. Once activated, they won’t come online for four minutes. And during that window, they can’t be detected by security.
Okay, do we need to review? You have–
90 seconds.
Okay, transmitter’s up.
Okay, he’s in.
This can’t be good.
I am so totally confused.
If that’s true, my head is definitely going to explode.
Yeah. Calabrese Fine Imports. 2119 McWhorther Street.
I lost the signal.
Uh, the marks and use of lead are consistent with a medieval device subtly called a lead sprinkler. The device is used to shower victims with molten lead, or in the case of Mr.
They did find William Dowd’s daughter living as Lisa Neil– new name, new Social. She’s definitely hiding from something.
So, uh, our metallurgist broke down the lead that was found on William Dowd. A specific dye was added to deepen the gray scale.
To an online company. They made many sales, but only one stands out – the St. James shelter. It’s a halfway house for ex-cons in Philadelphia. They use the lead to make religious jewelry. Could be a location for the Vehm.
Right. You and Ressler.
Did he?
Well, I can’t imagine it was difficult to write nice things. I’m glad he did.Someone needed to.
ME finished the autopsies on the three Vehm found at the scene. Says he’s ready for a show-and-tell. Seemed pretty excited about it.
You’re welcome. Uh, what for, exactly?
Oh. That. Too many gerunds?
Look, I know it was the wrong thing to do, but this task force needs you.
Maybe not. Um You have one.
Oh, uh, sir, I didn’t– I didn’t know that–
Are you, uh– Are you sleeping here?
I am so sorry.
Yeah, I don’t — But I do have some limeade in the fridge downstairs, along with these cherry turnovers that Agent Keen brought in that are amazing. Should I bring them up?
Yeah.
Of course. Women.♤
All right, the money for the room was wired from a phony overseas account, but I do have a cell number used to book the reservation. Mr. Cooper is expediting a warrant for a tap.
I think it’s romantic to forgive someone you love even if they had an insane error in judgment, which gives you night sweats and causes you to lose nine pounds in a month.
Hey, guys. Bad news– the cell number he used to book the room is a burner.
Why?
Hang on –  Anna Gardner. She’s Christopher Eriksson’s fiancé and a nurse at City Memorial.
He’s the youngest son. That must be why the promnestria is there.
Okay, so, I’ve been monitoring he promnestria’s burner, and he just placed a call to some kind of personal assistant, I think. The call was made to a residence in London owned by a Mr. Alistair Pitt. So Scotland Yard pulled his taxes. He’s the right age for our suspect, claims he’s a corporate consultant. Here. And listen.
Hang on.
There were 93 cases, including Ethan’s, where parents considered adoption, then backed out. Of those, 16 kids died or went missing within a year of the visit– 16 kids with cognitive, physical, or psychological issues.
I searched the National Child Identification Program, and of the prints we lifted from the finger paint on Ethan’s body, seven of them belong to that group of missing children.
Oh, no. Agent Ressler. 20 minutes ago, Noah Shuster logged into the DCFS website. Ressler: Why wasn’t his access denied?
He searched for Ethan, and in his file, his temporary emergency guardian is listed as– Jesus. Call Keen. Get units there now.
Noah Shuster looked up Ethan in the foster system and found your address. We think he’s coming for the boy. Agent Ressler’s on his way. [ Beeps ]
Feniseca tarquinius– also known as the harvester butterfly– highly localized, related to a species found in Africa and Asia. The only carnivorous butterfly in North America.
Okay. This is amazing. Uh, well, maybe not amazing. I mean, how many people are in the market for carnivorous butterfly larvae?
Okay, I tracked nine shipments in the last six months– eight to sanctuaries, wildlife preserves, and zoos.
Exactly. 
Well, there are rumors online– an art professor, a political journalist. Some think he’s an urban myth.
Okay, the computer you sent me from Randy Brenner– the webcam is definitely the source of the Rigby photo.
Correct. I just analyzed the hard drive and found a rat.
Remote Access Trojan. It takes over a system, accesses the webcam. But the thing is, this is not your average rodent. From what I can tell, it uses artificial intelligence to modify its payload, which is rare. Like, super-rare. In fact, I’ve seen this exact AI automation before– once. As part of a classified security briefing by the NSA.
Too many.
What about Agent Keen? I haven’t seen her since this morning.
I’m on it. Okay, here we go. Of the 1,000-plus downloads of the NSA program, 13 are from the New York metropolitan area. Five trace back to apartments leased by women.
And these last three were downloaded in the last few hours– after Brenner was murdered.
Okay, here’s what I could find. The space was leased six months ago to a Reginald Turner, age 44. Paid all six months in advance and gave one character reference– a high-school art-history teacher in Virginia, who he listed as a former colleague.
Already running. That’s him.
From what I can tell, he only had one show, a pop-up gallery in the East Village, and the reviews were not kind.
No problem. I know just the mega rodent for the job.♤
Interviewing Adelson. I know. I am watching you right now.
I’m looking at Drexel’s laptop. Randy Brenner’s computer isn’t the only one he ratted. He’s running another video feed from Adelson’s office. Look to your right. There must be a webcam.
He’s recording everything, and not to the system– to some remote location. I don’t know where. Here, let me try something. [ Keyboard clacking ] [ Computer beeps ] Whoa. Whoa. Two more feeds just popped up. Okay, you guys should get back here. 
Sir, you’re gonna want to take a look at this. This is a continuous feed being run live from Adelson’s office.
So far, I’ve only seen four. One was from Randy Brenner’s house. The second, Adelson’s office. And these are the other two.
Working on it. 
So, now we know what Brenner and Adelson were up to. But what about Drexel? All the footage he’s been gathering– We still haven’t figured out where it’s being recorded or what he planned to do with it. 
The US Post Office initiated pneumatic tube service in 1893. Soon, it had over 27 miles of tubes running beneath Manhattan, Brooklyn, and The Bronx, and that is just the post office. There were libraries, hospitals, department stores.
There are hundreds of tubes and thousands of terminal points.
There is no way to untangle it. …
Nothing on the van. It’s a late-model Chevy Express. There are thousands registered in the Tri-State area. And the plates were stolen from a Honda Accord on the day of the abduction. Cooper: Do it. Leak the contract.
Okay, we are go. I-95 is shut down, and the target is approaching our detour. Yes. He’s taking the off-ramp.
Uh, yeah. Hearing every word.
What? What is it? What’s wrong?
Um, okay, well, uh, I’m told the bomb squad won’t be there for 12.
Two minutes isn’t nearly enough time to evacuate.
Uh, okay. That’s not helping. All right, there are four batteries. We need to disable all four. Okay, first I need you to cut the green wire that leads to the switch on the bottom. But just make sure you don’t disturb the mercury.
All right, trace the wires from the timing device and cut the… Okay, cut the orange and white ones. Orange and white.
“I’m sorry” takes less than one. 28 seconds.
You called her the “B” word.
Blue. Blue. Cut the blue wire.
The weapon Mr. Reddington was talking about is the latest generation of so-called “Gravity bombs.” It is completely maneuverable and has an adjustable yield, so you can choose whether to destroy a small city or just a couple of blocks.
Uh, sorry. Playlist for the wedding reception. Which I really need to discuss with you.
[ Aside ] Liz.
[ Hands Liz recording of playlist ] Uh, playlist for the wedding. It’s definitely a work in progress, so…
Mr. Cooper, genius.
No wonder he is the Assistant Director. The way his mind works, his attention to detail, I can’t believe he’s living in his office.
Did I just say that or think that?
No. I mean, not living living. He’s – he’s working living. He’s here all the time. Point is, he was right. Uh, to handle a nuclear weapon, Solomon and his men will need something to shield themselves from the radiation. The Hunt Valley Nuclear Research Facility. Right outside of Baltimore. They were robbed an hour ago by a group of armed men who took an isotope transfer cask.
What about the B-52s?
The band. Total crowd pleaser, right? The B-52s “Rock Lobster.”
Uh, yeah, right. I’ve I.D.’d the woman in the video as Nez Rowan. Sending you her info now. She is ex-Navy, where she was a nuclear weapons specialist.
Yeah, she also goes by about a half-dozen other aliases. Been a freelancer for the past eight years.
Actually, one of her preferred aliases – Harper Waters – is currently checked into a motel in Baltimore.
All right, I’ve got a satellite view of the overpass, but if there is a van, we can’t see it from the air.
Tom. [ Aram is extremely nervous. They have not met before. ]
It’s Aram. I mean, uh, Agent Mojtabai. 
Whatever. I recognize you from –
Uh, no. Uh, from your description.
Whoa. Quite a grip. Sor– I was, uh…
I know. Right? It’s, uh… It’s my grandfather’s. 
Going to be a pretty sweet getaway car, right? Uh, not that you would know. Or ever, uh, like, uh, need one. A getaway, y-you know?
Yeah.
Ah, right. Yes. Uh, she’s inside.
Sure. I’ll just – I’ll leave the keys in the visor.
All right, don’t worry – My friends, they are the best at what they do.
Yeah.
It’s okay. It’s okay. It’s okay. No. Oh, God. What? Okay, hold on, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Hold on. You’re okay. You’re okay. Right there. Stay with me. Stay with me. It’s gonna stop. No. No. Oh, God. [ She dies ]
They heard the sirens. Half of Metro PD must be out there by now.
It’s pointless trying to identify a manufacturer. That EarCom is pure black market. Nitride transistor technology, a built-in terahertz radio.
Uh, not exactly. There were no prints on the outside of the EarCom, but I pulled partial fingerprints from the button battery inside.
Samar found Asa Jacobi’s wife. She’s living in Phoenix, and she has had no contact with her husband since he went missing.
They are when they always fall on your wedding anniversary. So I traced the wife’s phone records. Those calls were all made on pay phones, but they were paid for with calling cards.
Yep, and the accounts used to pay those bills also paid for this mid-century Columbia Heights charmer. Been under single ownership for the past 20 years, only there is no owner. It’s an alias.
Yeah, hang on. I just got a visual on her ambulance. Charting intercept course. Okay, take your next left. I’m gonna route you around traffic. [ Wailing continues ] 
Agent Ressler, it’s time. 
We can’t be late.
Yeah, and we will, just not now. We have to go. 
Wait. I need to… I need to say something.
“When she shall die… take her… and cut her out in little stars, and she will make the face of heaven so fine “that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.” “Romeo and Juliet.” Agent Keen loved Shakespeare. And Dr. Seuss. She loved dim sum and… and Beyoncé, and those little wooden, uh, foot massagers that go under your desk. (VOICE BREAKS) I know the things she loved because we were friends. Even though I called her “Agent Keen,” that was out of the respect I had for her. (BREATHING UNEVENLY) Her friends also called her Liz. (CRYING) I miss you, Liz. (SNIFFLES) Just… Okay. Thank you.  (SPEAKING INAUDIBLY) 
All right, whoever was after Agent Keen hacked into a telecom hub. The servers in that basement were sifting data intercepted from the fiber optic cables.
I don’t know. Once they realized we’d figured out what they were doing, they pulled the plug and… and severed all communications.
Right. Yes. Watching and listening through private security cameras… (TAPPING KEY) traffic cams.
I’m tracing the packet routes, but it’s… it’s gonna take time. What I do know is that, uh, Agent Keen wasn’t the only person they were monitoring. Uh, they were intercepting cell and CCTV footage out of the Warwick Hotel in Midtown, along with voice and Internet traffic out of something called the, uh, Global Financial Council.
I don’t know. It’s… (SIGHS) There’s so many pieces to sort through. It’s… This is the sort of thing Mr. Reddington would just see without even blinking. 
Okay, I’ve got something. All right, one of the cellphones being tapped belongs to an executive assistant named Amanda Bigelow, the other to an Anthony Mayhew, a chauffeur. Both work for an executive who’s staying at our third point of reference, the Warwick Hotel, while in New York to speak at a conference held by reference point number four, the Global Financial Council. So the common denominator is the executive. Benjamin Stalder. (TYPING) President of the Energy Consortium Group.
Surprise.
Please don’t be mad at him. Dembe understood how important this is, and you weren’t answering his calls, or I-I never would have dropped by unannounced. It’s rude, and… I hate to be rude.
You need to come back with me.
We’re not getting anywhere. In the investigation of… Agent Keen’s death. We could use your help.
It’s more than that. I can’t work. The Post Office, without Agent Keen… Without you… it’s just a government building.
No. You gave me a speech over an empty grave, about the foundational elements in our lives. “People who form the brick and mortar of who we are.” How, when they’re suddenly not there, we… we collapse into rubble. Now it was after Agent Keen was almost killed by the Cabal. But I saved her. You looked into that empty grave back then and said you’d be staring at her if it weren’t for me. Now I understand why you have collapsed into rubble. I do, and I’m truly sorry. But I’m here to collect on your debt. You owe me. So let’s go.
I thought I’d be able to figure out where they routed their data, but I couldn’t find the end of the proxy chain.
Or hidden servers… over the Earth. I checked all the viable telecom satellites in GEO and LEO orbit, but I didn’t check the offline ones. (TYPING)
Yeah, there are thousands of unused and decommissioned satellites circling our heads… space junk. It’s not enough that we litter the planet. Okay, the challenge is to figure out which ones they used.
Okay, I think I’m getting somewhere.
I’m not looking for a needle. We need the whole haystack. (TAPS KEY) And if I’m right, it’s the Artax Network.
It’s an old telecom project to provide data coverage to every corner of the Earth through a network of 73 satellites. Anyway, the company went bankrupt and the project was abandoned.
Well, I’ve just gained access to a relay station, and I am about to lock onto one of the satellites. If it’s in use, the data will be encrypted, but… we’ll know if it’s active. Okay. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Here we go. (BEEP)
Okay, so I was able to get a location by examining the latency patterns in the satellite signal. They’re being fed to 2054 Pulaski Avenue.
Other than Nez, we can’t put faces to any of the mercs. So I scrubbed through the Warwick’s security footage to try and find some.
(TAPS KEY) Nothing. Um, at least no mercs. But I did find this… (TAPS KEYS)
Well, that doesn’t look like a woman… or a conversation… he’d have forgotten. (TAPS KEY)
I don’t know. And we can’t ask Stalder. I checked. He just cleared U.S. airspace. 
Mr. Reddington.
You’re back.
Mr. Reddington.
The Artax Network.
That doesn’t look like a woman… or a conversation… he’d have forgotten.
Mr. Reddington says her name is Susan Scott Hargrave.
Right. Okay, yeah. So… I’m sitting there eating a half gallon of ice cream… rum raisin… when he suddenly shows up. Mr. Reddington at my door in the middle of the night. I know. Kind of weird. Although, truth be told, we do sort of have a special relationship. Anyway, I showed him the picture, and he recognized her right away. Called her Scottie. Says she and her husband, Howard, own a corporation called Halcyon Aegis.
According to their website, yes. But Mr. Reddington says they are a private military-intelligence agency who specializes in operations too sophisticated or politically incorrect for anyone else, like working with Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program or negotiating with terrorists for the release of hostages in direct violation of American foreign policy.
So you’re saying that our government is protecting the people who took Agent Keen, hiding them from us? Please tell me that is not true.
Or we could try and get the intel without her knowing. If one of you could get close enough to her, I think I can get what we need.
Amanda Bigelow is a creature of habit. She goes to the same coffee shop every day for lunch, laptop in hand. All you need to do is get close to her. You’ll have a device called a wireless packet sniffer. It has the ability to mirror her computer. The sniffer looks like a mobile hotspot, so just set it out on the table, and I’ll do the rest.
Are you set up? I’m not getting anything.
How far away?
Okay, get closer. 
Something’s wrong. I’m not getting any signal from her computer. Abort. Abort.
Uh, whatever. Just… We need a new plan.
Nowhere yet. We tried hacking her laptop, but she was on a highly encrypted network, so Tom started talking with her, and seriously, this guy should write a book. Anyway, we are implementing plan “B” tonight… on their date.
Mr. Clark made three calls today to another secure cell. Now, we can’t trace the owner of that cell, but believe it or not, it is on right now, so I have been triangulating its location. They are somewhere on this block near Eighth and King. I’m still running algorithms, but I should be able to vector it down within a few hundred square feet.
Okay. Signal is on the move. Halfway up the block on your left. Target should be walking south.
Hang on. Let me lock onto both of your signals, guide you that way. Okay, you need to cross the street. They are heading towards you about 100 feet up the block. You should be able to see the target.
You are right on top of them. What… What just happened? It’s gone.
Lost the signal.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING) Target’s back. Okay, now look right behind you.
Okay, that is him. You are on the dot, literally.
Guys, what is going on?
You are letting him get away. Okay, look for a car. Guys, look for a moving vehicle.
You are letting him get away.
Samuel Rand. Vice President of Vestant Petroleum, an oil and gas company.
Tonight, you jump her air gap. Whoa. No. Oh, I’m not… No, what I’m suggesting is that you insert this thumb drive into, uh, her laptop. It… It’s got an exploit that will give us access to her computer and her company’s proprietary telecommunications infrastructure… e-mails, phone calls. Should lead us to her boss. Look, what you thought I was suggesting before, I would never, ever suggest… that.
No catch. It is just plug and play. Downloads automatically in one to two minutes.
No, all quiet. Still no sign of Halcyon.
“Fast-and-Furious”-style. Get some street racers to board the trucks and overpower the drivers, right?
Guys, I’m getting reports of 🔥💥🔥 explosions 🔥💥🔥 at Kerogent facilities across Europe and the Middle East.
If the detonator is built into that case, there will be no way to disarm the device in time.
Yes. I don’t want to know how you did it, but… yes. Actually, I do want to know how. I don’t understand how you could do it. Agent Keen loved you. I know it’s none of my business, but…
Okay, good. (CHUCKLING) Excellent. (SIGHS) No, it probably shouldn’t matter, but it somehow does. So, uh, let us see what our Ms. Bigelow is up to. 
Patience. Patience.
What? Oh. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Believe me. (CHUCKLES) You wouldn’t understand.
Holy crap. Jackpot. 
The FBI just received a call from Airports Authority. Mr. Reddington escaped police custody from a first-class lounge at BWI.
All I know is that one officer’s missing, one’s injured, and I cannot reach Mr. Reddington.
This sounds like a bad idea.
Okay, uh, the server room is across from the CFO’s office, second door from the end of the hall, right-hand side.
I’m gonna need you to be a little more specific than that.
Are any of them connected to a modem or a screen?
Great. That’s the server the terminal’s connected to. Follow the cable and insert, uh, you know, the, uh…
Yes. Uh, well, it’s not mine, but, uh, yeah.
Now we have remote access.
Yeah, how else am I gonna generate the bank president’s password? (KEYBOARD CLACKING)
You can’t generate enough personal details to create a useful password dictionary. (BEEPING) Whoa.
Okay, as soon as I enter the password, we should have access to the funds.
Yes, Agent Mojtabai speaking.
Uh, Dumont, uh, I think I figured it out.
Tom, hey. How cool is this? I didn’t expect to talk to you until Agnes’ baptism.
Right. Uh, sorry. They said you, uh, drugged Pruitt?
Exactly, an opiate narcotic will cause the pupils to be constricted to pinpoint size, and the scanner…
The scanner’s unable to detect the retinal signature.
Tropicamide. It’s what eye doctors use to dilate your pupils.
He’s trying to lock us out.
As soon as the scans verify, the funds are ours. It’s gonna be close, sweet cheeks.
No, no. No, no, no. I-I mean… yes, totally, but… Diaz. He subpoenaed Kirk. He is forcing him to come to D.C. We’re gonna get him.
She is so beautiful. (CHUCKLES) And that little dress.
We’re giving it back, the money we stole? Why did we take it in the first place?
Why don’t I like the sound of this?
So, uh… it worked.
You know what that means, right? You know what Mr. Reddington’s gonna do. I’m not okay with this. Are you?
I’m looking at it now. Kirk was definitely a passenger on that jet. Not only that, he was pre-cleared by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at Abu Dhabi Airport. He’s here.
I don’t know. Wait. Wait, this can’t… There’s a second flight plan, a new one, filed a few minutes ago. Kirk’s plane just took off again.
Abel Santamaria Airport in Cuba.
What are we looking for?
Nothing.
Okay, hang on. There is something. A Hawker 400 November-6-4-5-2-Delta left a private airstrip for Cuba with two passengers… a man and his infant daughter.
Is it true? She’s alive?
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How is that… there were complications during labor. And the doctor, he declared her dead.
But there was a funeral. I-I was a pallbearer.
So Agent Keen is alive? Uh, but her funeral and her death… She faked her death.
Away from us?
Why? What does he want with Agent Keen?
And, uh, what about Agnes?
Don’t you, sir?
Manuel Orentez Esteban. Leader of Pinochet’s Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.
This is Agent Mojtabai.
Tom? Hey. Tell me you’re with Agent Keen.
We can find them. Okay, let me think. Let me think. Okay, what I’m thinking is, um, did you help Agent Keen fake her death?
Not helpful, I know. Okay. But did you? At the funeral, when you put a flower on her casket–
The oscillator. Right. Of course. Okay, if you could rewire it, you might be able to turn the PLL receiver into this–
You do? Then, uh, why are you…
Oh. Oh, you already… uh… Wow, that’s, uh, that is impressive. [ Beep, typing on keyboard ] Okay. Hang on. I’m on it.
Did you know? At the christening, when you made me a godfather to Agnes–
I’m trying to ping the signal. Waiting for a reply… from both of you.
I’ll let you know when, uh, I find the signal.
Mr. Reddington. It’s Aram.
I have information on Agent Keen. A location. She’s being held near this–
Oh. Magic. How’d you do that?
Agnes? Right. Tom called. Thanks to him, I was able to track the vehicle where he had last seen Agnes, a blue Dodge sedan.
No. Uh, last time I spoke to him, he was on his way to the location where Agent Keen was being held.
I think you were wrong not going to Cuba. I’m not saying what Agent Keen did was right, but as long as her life is in danger, as long as Agnes’s life is in danger, I think we have to put our feelings aside.
But she is. And no matter how we feel, I think we have to do something about it.
If you don’t help, and something happens to Agent Keen or Agnes, I know you. You won’t be able to live with yourself. 
Excuse me. Sorry. It’s Mr. Reddington.
What about Agnes?
No digital signal to carry GPS coordinates.
I know this is not about me, it is about Agent Keen, but I don’t know if I have the strength to lose her again.
So she’s alive?
Sorry, I just wanted to hear the update, which is… the greatest update ever.
You’re back. [ Hugs Liz, dutifully ] I’m so glad you’re okay.
Samar.
What, you mean, like… an Angel Investor?
That’s an amazing idea. I mean, um, it’s horrible, but, uh, it’s amazing.
Uh, it’s, uh– it’s not. I tried to re-create it using a hex editor and a customized bit of forensic software to carve it off the drive…
But, uh, there wasn’t enough data to run, so I tried a new LSM algorithm. This is all I got. Oh, my God. That’s it.
Symmetry. Some people’s faces are symmetrical. Yours isn’t, but…
No. Uh, no. No, no. I just mean your right eye is a twinch larger than your left, which is… it’s adorable. Plus, your chin kind of does this thing–
Right. Uh, symmetry. Just– here. Watch this. 
Uh, we cracked it. Symmetry. That was the key here. Look. Okay, this is everything I could recover from the original data– about half a face and with lousy resolution. But if we mirror the image, then make a few tweaks to connect the halves…
A completely symmetrical face, which nobody actually has, but it gave us enough points of comparison to run a search.
Okay, here we go.
Uh-oh.
Okay. I got nothing. Signal is down. Signal is down.
Sir, we have six vehicles in floating-box formation. Agents Ressler and Navabi are to the southeast.
Uh, yes. For now. She needs time. We all do.
I don’t hate you, Liz. But I do hate what you did. 
I am way ahead of you, sir. Except there is no train. I mean, there’s no train officially scheduled on the track at this time.
Agent Keen. [ Trying to get her attention ]
Liz. Uh, it’s a CDC shipment. They must be transporting some kind of biohazardous materials. 
[ Reading ] “Class A– substances capable of causing permanent disability, life-threatening or fatal disease in humans or animals.”
Uh… I was tracking the train using Central Traffic Control’s rail monitoring system, but the signal just went dark.
I… do not know. Let me see if I can access the CTC’s video grid.
I’m sorry, but the train should be visible on this camera by now. It should be right there.
That’s not possible. There’s only one rail line in the area. The train was going at least 40. It should’ve passed you two minutes ago.
Right here, Sir.
I think so. Why?
Yeah, that’s true.
West? No.
Okay, satellite mapping in the area done three weeks ago doesn’t show a hangar or a split-off.
[ To Cooper ] Sir, HRT is on site. They’re moving in now.
We just heard from the CDC. The missing sample, number 17? It’s cultures taken from the Ribowski virus.
Hey.
Nothing much. Just hanging out, making a little dinner.
Just some pasta. Nothing big.
Right. So I’ll just bring you some tomorrow.
Uh, yes, but, uh, it– it’s fine. We were, uh–
Uh, you’re– you’re not interrupting.
So it worked. In Gaia’s mind, he protected people.
Hey. So, about last night… Sorry we couldn’t talk. But if you want to grab lunch today and chat…
Figured what out?
So it’s official? Uh… I mean, I-I knew you were thinking about it, but you actually…
Right, sure. That is, you… you’ve given it a lot of thought, so… …congratulations.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a suspect. Okay, check this out. The Kentucky chemical plant wasn’t the only facility that received a visit from a spot inspector. Three of the other accident sites also received spot inspections within a few weeks of their failing.
Right. I got surveillance video from three of the facilities on this particular spot inspector.
He’s there.
No, but…
Uh, no, actually. According to security at the facility, a guy showed up less than an hour ago claiming to be filling in for the usual inspector.
The pipeline targeted by Gaia carries fracked gas… a process that environmentalists oppose.
Maybe. Or maybe because of this. San Bruno, 2010. A ruptured natural-gas pipeline caused a 72-foot-long crater and killed 8 people. Last year in Allentown, another one exploded underneath a city street, killing five.
Research. Look at where Gaia’s tools and fake I.D. badge were found… the spot of the highest gas pressure. I think he was trying to identify the most vulnerable point, the perfect place to hit.
Because there are safety rules in place for new pipelines, but they don’t always apply for existing lines.
It gets worse, actually. I had an expert over at PHMSA do a blast-radius projection just to see what kind of damage an explosion at this spot would cause. In an urban area like this, we’re talking hundreds of homes, schools, a city hospital… and this… Stone Park, the largest nuclear power plant on the eastern seaboard of the United States.
Ayers was a helicopter pilot, and before that, an enlisted aircraft mechanic. Three tours in Iraq, decorated. This guy’s a war hero. Medical discharge in 2011 after participating in Operation Tomodachi.
Flew into an unscheduled emergency venting of radioactive gas. He and several members of his crew got radiation poisoning.
Causing unusually high and low tides.
Uh, guys. Look at this. Martin Powell, one of their mechanics, had a heart attack in a bar a few days ago.
Yeah, I can, uh… I can try and hack into the onboard avionics, try and take control.
No luck. I-I can’t access the AFCS directly, and even if I could, there’s an automatic fail-safe.
Okay, I may have something. Okay, I’ve hacked into something called the stability augmentation system. And I think I can feed data into the heading reference system centers, override the controls.
You mean?
Right, right.
I got it. I got it.
Yeah, um…
If I click on this, he’ll die. I’ve killed somebody once. I can’t take another life again.
(SIGHS) I’m sorry.
Hey, hey. Nice work today. It is, uh, no small thing to prevent Manhattan from being unlivable… as opposed to unaffordable.
I’m sorry you think so.
No, that… That’s it. Mr. Cooper understood.
Oh, is that what this is all about? The fact that I have a girlfriend.
You know what? Forget it.
You know when I congratulated you on submitting your transfer request? I didn’t mean it. I was trying to make you feel better, because that’s the polite thing to do. And I like being polite. What I wanted to say was that… …I’m glad you’re going. As far as I’m concerned, you can’t go fast enough.
Married, no children– chemical engineer in R&D at Bethesda Plastics.
Elise, hey. I, uh… I’m not really allowed to FaceTime at work.
Whoa.
Uh… no. Uh… Maybe.
Uh, yes, but not enough to run the image through a database. What I did find… was… this.
It’s a DC law firm specializing in IP and patent law.
My dishwasher, it’s, um… super finicky. I, uh, almost always dry by hand.
Right, I’m just saying it wasn’t her fault– the bubbles. FYI.
Right, three of the numbers were hidden, so I had to run down a few hundred possible combinations– 246 to be exact. And in addition to two PTA presidents and an amazing doggy daycare, I found… this burner phone, and I had the cell carrier triangulate its location to this apartment building in Oak Hill.
112. But our suspect’s name is… Silas Gouldsberry.
He is the only tenant who works for the US Patent Office.
I’ve got access to the Patent Office’s server’s infrastructure, and there is a major alert from the TCP retries counter, meaning someone is uploading data. Like– like, a ton of it.
Uh, no, but I can– I can see how long it’s gonna take. Another 14 minutes– same timetable he gave Agent Navabi to get the money.
Sure, maybe, but if he did that, then they’d become available… to the many at the expense of the few. He’s open-sourcing them.
Yes.
Sir, I think I have another way.
Yes, if you manually set it off, the safety override should automatically open the doors. You should be able to access the system from a utility module in the fire panel.
There should be a circuit board on the lower right corner.
Uh, yeah, hold on. W-We’re working on it.
Agent Navabi. We’re gonna kill the power to the fire system. Doing so will release a fire-suppression agent. It’s an inert gas, so it’s safe, but you might have a problem with …
Oh! Uh, the plug with two red wires just below the green blinking light, pull that– pull it now!
… Visibility.
Okay, don’t pull out the flash drive. To corrupt the entire zipped file, hit “Abort” on the data-transfer dialogue.
Sorry. Did I miss something? I-Is this about going after Kirk and…
Here. This should lift the mood. I got some… leftover lemon chicken, Ho Kow crispy beef. We are gonna have it for lunch.
I’ve also got Paco’s Tacos.
It’s why I’m late. I, uh… Wait. How’d you know?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.
No, uh… [ Chuckles ] She’s beautiful and smart. She’s an 11. I mean, I’m a 6, 4 on most days. Don’t get me wrong. I am going to enjoy it, but… something is up. Maybe I’m her rebound guy, or she’s got three months to live or…
Really? You think so?
Good morning.
All night.
You think he’s got a tap into the Post Office?
Impossible. We’ve got more firewalls than the NSA’s Utah Data Center. And I personally turn it inside-out every morning. It is a bit-banger’s nightmare. Unhackable.
Everything. Everything’s wrong. Sir, I did as you ordered and isolated all the malicious code… Or remnants of it, buried deep in our operating system. At first, I was confused. Our firewalls should have bounced it. But then… I realized the only way we could have been breached was through social engineering, or physical access with a Rubber Ducky.
A keystroke injection attack platform disguised as a thumb drive. It would bypass all standard countermeasures by emulating a plug-in keyboard, reprogramming our host computer as if the hacker was manually typing in the code.
Yes. Someone had to dupe an FBI employee with level 4 clearance. I spent the last 18 hours collating log-ins with the first appearance of the malicious code in order to figure out who got punk’d so we could interview the employee and nail that hacker.
You knew.
[ Voice breaking ] Why didn’t you tell… Oh, God.
[ Sits down ] No. I may be dumb, but I’m not stupid. I just don’t… I don’t know how I’m gonna pull this off.
She’s coming over to my place for dinner tonight.
No. It is a horrible idea. But I have to if we’re gonna have any chance of accessing The Thrushes’ servers.
I’ve got my own Rubber Ducky. 
Oh, she’ll have it. Trust me. We’re, uh… We’re binge-watching “Stranger Things.” Talk about life imitating art, huh?
A few minutes. I, uh, designed it to ping the main servers and to e-mail us GPS coordinates.
Well, not the fob. I hate the fob. It’s too much clanking with the key ring.
[ Chuckles nervously ] I’ve never been on the, um… The sending side of one of these deals. Yeah, I don’t know if I can do this.
No, no. What, am I gonna shoot my girlfriend?
I’m not like you. I’m really scared.
Banana?
Really?
Okay.
That dream date… The crispy beef, ginger beer… That was all you, wasn’t it? I knew it was too good to be true. 
Yeah. Can’t wait.
Me? No. I, um… I’m just, um… Oh, I forgot, I got wine.
It is for you. It is, um, supposed to go great with, um…
Yes! Yum. [ Chuckles ] Putta-nesca. Puttanesca.
Oh, you know, the usual. FBI stuff. You know, good guys, bad guys. Oh! They got Cheese Nibs for the snack machine downstairs. So, so awesome.
I know, right? I love Cheese Nibs. I mean, I don’t love them as much as Goldfish…
… but, you know, it’s a huge… it’s a huge…
Oh, no.
I’m such a klutz.
You know what? Uh, just… just give me a… give me a second to go change.
Yeah! Yeah, everything’s, um… Everything is, uh, great. Um, are you hungry? ‘Cause I sure am hu…
Oh. [ Laughs nervously ]
No, uh… We… We shouldn’t. Um… Your sauce, I think it’s burning.
[ Laughs nervously ] No, I’m serious. We’re gonna… We’re gonna set this place on fire.
No, no. Elise, no, no. I’m serious.
God! Just not now, okay?
I don’t want to cause a fire is all.
Nothing’s wrong.
Okay, you’re right. There’s something. There’s, um… someone else.
I am in love with someone else.
What? No. No.
Of course not. Not… Not her.
No. No. Don’t. I don’t want you to feel stupid. This is all my fault. I-I-I should have told you about, um… not Samar. I don’t want you to feel really…
Quack, quack, bitch.
Banana! I could use a banana!
Hey. Okay. Banana. Okay, okay, okay. Oh! Jesus! No!
[ Panting ] Yeah. Yeah. What part of “banana” did you not understand? 
No. I mean, uh, yes, of course, but… he was already suspicious. Uh, when we were together, she got a call.
I was an idiot.
Trained, or born?
That’s… That’s great. 
I mean, for real? Because if that’s true, we have to celebrate, right? 
 I love them. 
[ Typing ] Well, apparently, he lost a job to The Coroner. Her name was Giza Barerra.
Barerra’s father was a Mexican drug trafficker who forced her to marry a dangerous rival when she was 14 years old. 20 years later, she got her revenge by murdering her father and his rival, uniting their cartels under her leadership.
Now Barerra was raised in a convent. Apparently, her father also was a devout Catholic who insisted his child learn Latin.
So I wrote an algorithm to search for schools that still require Latin and cross-indexed it with a web search of tutoring services that teach Latin and, well… [ Typing ] …this woman works at a private school in Brooklyn Heights. Think it could be her?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Won’t your fingerprints and DNA ID you as an agent of the FBI?
Mr. Reddington’s a genius. Could be an evil genius, but still.
Yes. Sonia Bloom. Worked on next-gen genome research, re-sequencing DNA to help the body fight off disease. In 2001, she and her partner applied for a patent. A week later, her partner was murdered, and she went underground.
Yeah. But you didn’t know this. [ Typing, beep ] Her partner was Matthew Hadj.
Okay. Sonia Bloom is hiding as Adrian Shaw. Now based on what we know about The Coroner, it’s safe to assume that almost every personal detail about her life is false. The only detail we know to be true is that she’s a doctor. Was then. Is now. And while I can’t connect her past research to Kirk, current AMA records indicate that now, as Shaw, she has a new partner who specializes in… Wait for it. [ Telephone ringing in distance ] Hematology.
Dr. Shaw may be Kirk’s last best hope for finding a cure.
[ Typing ] Yeah, looks like the clinic is owned by an LLC based in Delaware.
Yeah. And it’s definitely not somewhere anyone would look. 
[ On phone ] Harbor Patrol and Customs will meet you on site.
Red Hook Harbor Master has the ship docking in 45 minutes.
Yeah, already e-mailed it to you. 16 crew members and the licensed cargo is medical equipment.
Not just any equipment– thermal cyclers, centrifuges, incubators. Yeah, these are products used in genome research.
Agent Mojtabai.
I’m tracking it now. Agents Ressler and Navabi are closing in from the west. I’m vectoring you in. 
I’ll start a search for properties in the area associated with Kirk or his shell companies.
All right, I’m looking at CCTV feeds of a silver panel van that crossed through the intersection of Newmarket and Maiden less than five minutes ago.
Yeah.
If the van has a telematics system, it may have a two-way link to a service provider that relays GPS data.
All right, stay on Hampden unless you cross 188, then take your next right.
Yeah, well, it would, except that van covered over 40 miles of road today.
Determine the speed and the number of stops. The van made eight stops in the last 96 minutes. An apartment complex in Friendship Heights, a gym in Bethesda, what looks like a strip mall…
Uh, right. Bodhi Fitness.
Really? I’m being questioned in connection to a Justice Department investigation into whether my girlfriend committed espionage.
So I’m either a traitor or a moron.
Ah, you always know just what to say.
Uh, no, actually, this is about a different nightmare scenario. I’ve been running diagnostics on the timer chip you recovered from Arkani’s factory, and it is far more impressive than anything we’ve seen from the NMB or any extremist group for that matter. In fact, it is as good as anything the United States can make because… we did make it.
More specifically, the defense contractor Blackthorn Kincaid made it.
[ On phone ] Yeah, I understand. [ Click ] [ To Cooper: ] Uh, that was Agent Keen. Mr. Reddington says NMB leadership sent six operatives to reclaim that bomb or, um, uh, whatever it is they lost at that factory.
Oh, yeah, one. Farook Al-Thani. 
Okay, I was at the gym, and she had been waiting for a friend and asked to borrow my phone. Uh, she said hers was lost. And then, you know, one thing led to another and…
Well, when you put it like that–
Yes, because I didn’t. I love this country. I take my job very, very seriously. If I’m guilty of anything, it’s– it– I have bad taste in women. A sort of blindness to– Shauna Boyd was a kleptomaniac. Julia Hernandez was legally married. April Roderhorst had a little bit of a secret porn addiction. Um, that’s a funny story, actually.
Yes, ma’am. 
Terrifying.
[ Scoffs ] In your eyes. In theirs, I look a lot like this guy.
Mr. Reddington said six NMB members were dispatched to the US in the last 24 hours. He gave us one name, but not the other five. Do you have any idea how many people fly into the country every day? So I had to customize an algorithm to search for– Five needles in a huge haystack.
Well, he’s the right age. He works for a Middle Eastern trade organization that I’m not sure actually exists. He lives in Lebanon, but flew into Libya last month, and I am not seeing a return ticket out. Thing is, he flew into JFK almost 72 hours ago, so that doesn’t fit Mr. Reddington’s intel.
Mr. Cooper got word from Main Justice. I am officially… not a person of interest.
Um… Yeah, right? Um… Hey, I’ve never been so relieved to be told I am not interesting. Uh, I thought we could, um, could maybe celebrate over… dinner.
[ Answers ] Agent Ressler.
The NMB?
All right, sending an alert to local law enforcement now, rolling all backup units to your location.
No. My program’s vetted tens of thousands of possible candidates but only one real suspect so far, and Agent Navabi cleared him.
His name is Yusuf Tillisi. His photo was part of the file we just sent you. But Samar spoke to him– said it was nothing. Yusuf Tillisi isn’t a terrorist.
Okay, satellite images of Cornerstone Park are coming online, uh, now.
SWAT units are taking positions around the park.
That’s her. [ Jumps up, pointing ] That’s her! Uh, South Drive.
Nothing. It just– it disappeared.
Oh, oh, I got one. I got one. Reports of someone flying a drone from the roof of the Mazelon Hostel. All right, the address–
Almost died in the process. 
He’s right. You should, uh, get some rest. Dinner can wait.
Totally.
Actually, uh… I don’t, uh, want a rain check. I mean… I do. Obviously, I do, but… I don’t. You know how I told you that deposition was terrifying? Yeah, it was worse terrifying. It was… embarrassing. There I was on the record, testifying to what horrible taste I have in women, my, uh, habit of falling for people who aren’t what they appear to be, what I make them out to be. What happened with Elise was kind of soul crushing. To find out that the person that you love…
I can’t be with a person like that. 
Oh, oh. Agent Keen, that is so cool. I had no idea you were so artsy-craftsy.
What? Like a gift?
This is ghoulish. A drowning superwoman?
The clock tower. I’ve been thinking about it. It’s, uh, it’s familiar. And then I realized I remembered it from Mr. Mathiesen’s seventh grade civics class. We studied all the great DC buildings in that class–
I think it’s the old Post Office tower.
All right, I’m tapped into every camera in the area, and I am not seeing anything.
Uh, guys? We’re looking for a guy on a bike, right?
I think that bike might be a motorcycle.
I cross-checked the dioramas against verifiable incidents, and in each case, the incident and the diorama were a match. This July, a sailboat washes ashore south of Naples. Both the owner and his wife are lost a sea. [ Beep ] Two months earlier, a Jaipur factory fire kills 18. [ Beeping ] A bus accident in Miami. A mass shooting in Madrid.
Hey. [ Knocks ] I think we found something in Maggie Driscoll’s medical records.
Us? Maybe. Or a killer. She wears a hearing aid, a very tiny high-frequency model.
I think the hearing aid might be picking up nearby conversations via radio frequency interference.
Which means at least one of our suspects is close. A neighboring building, uh, someone in the apartment complex.
Actually, yeah, I might. I think I can get us a step closer yet.
I’m still getting interference.
We, uh, we need to unplug anything that might cause RF interference– lights, appliances… [ Whispers ] Sorry. Okay. Uh, cellphones. And, uh, turn off your coms. We gotta go with walkies.
That is… not funny. When I was in college, Matt Skrdell had a Ouija board, and we actually made contact with my pet rabbit, Dash, God rest her soul, and it turns out she did not escape from her cage like I was told.
For now. But they’re out there, very close. [ Static continues ] The next time they call, we’re gonna find them.
We’re live. 
[ To Maggie ] It’s okay. It’s okay. You are gonna be okay, all right? Officers are gonna be here any minute. 
 I didn’t, no. But MPD says we had two officers down in the building. One was stripped, missing his gun, his badge.
Maybe she can.
Police radios operate on an RF frequency just like Maggie’s hearing device, which can cause interference. All right, go to frequency 154.400 and turn it up. [ Beep ] Turn it all the way up. [ Static crackles loudly ]
Guys, um, check this out. We couldn’t see it from Maggie’s dioramas, but, uh, there is a pattern. All right, the factory fire in Jaipur, it tanked the stock of the Zardozi Imports company. The man and his wife, who vanished off the coast of Naples in their sailboat, he was the CEO of a Silicon Valley tech firm. The company lost a quarter of its value after he disappeared. Judge Culpepper was set to rule against OJN Global in a patent infringement case. And Marlon Milch is the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Each of these catastrophes involved someone who was invaluable to the company they worked for, and their deaths dramatically affected the stock prices of those companies.
Agent Ressler, I think I have something, a way Charnquist may be planning to access the building. Surveillance imagery shows an engine room on the roof, and it is connected to a–
How’d you know that?
Okay, the one in this building is a Westbrook freight built in 1922. That’s before pneumatic fail-safes.
Sir, I know have a lot of bad news today, but the security system in the building shows there’s a backup generator.
Right, uh, okay, you already know Margot Rochet. [ Typing ] She’s a former federal corrections administrator. Has a network of prisoners and guards trading anything for intel into the criminal world.
I can’t ID Emma Knightly. [ Typing ] We know from the audio on Agent Keen’s wire that she sounds like she’s from England, but other than that, I’m drawing a big blank.
Tracking them as we speak.
Uh, guys, Smoll’s body has just been flagged by the CDC. They’ve rerouted it to a level four biocontainment lab.
Oh ho ho! I found our suspect.
Okay, uh, what’s going on?
Really? Because you seems upset. And before, uh, with Mr Cooper, about not getting paid enough …
I’m sure that was a mistake.
Oh, you opened my check.
Maybe it’s because you’re on loan from Mossad–
Actually, technically–
That is true. Okay. you should probably say something to Mr Cooper.
Yes. Uh, the suspect. Uh, the suspect. Yes. So I found a partial angle from the security camera behind the massage parlor. Check it out. Okay, the CDC has only one other recorded outbreak of Luschen’s in the U.S. A pawn broker in Maryland. The local coroner wrote it off as natural causes. But the weird thing is his pawn shop was robbed the day he died. And so, I dug up some security feeds and look who was there.
And in a bad disguise at both.
So she’s not trying to start a pandemic.
So I looked into Reddington’s Typhoid Mary angle and I found something. The first recorded outbreak of Luschen’s in human beings occurred in rural Moldova in 2002. A family of nine wiped out except for one daughter Natalie Luca. She was taken to a local clinic, but the outbreak was deemed too much for them to handle.
The World Health Organization called in Hawthorne Biologics, a company that specializes in infectious disease response. They brought the girl back to their research clinic outside Alexandria for further treatment.
Did you tell him why you freaked out?
That’s fantastic.
Okay, but, you know, it’s a start.
Okay, the vehicle is registered under a– Alec Moore.
Okay, pulling up his address–
Okay, I pulled these from from one of Malik’s hard drives. They’re blueprints for a compound in Sag Harbor, New York, owned by an offshore trust. Now, he also had a number of dossiers, including these. All right, Francois Troyet, owner of the world’s largest private collection of Post-Impressionist art. William Lawsover, a billionaire corporate debt restructurer. Caitlin Montag, gajillionaire author of the Buddy Chanticleer novels. The writing is atrocious, but I can’t put them down.
10 minutes.
On it. And that Hazmat team we sent earlier, they should be there any minute.
The Hazmat team.
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Come on now. All right, uh, satellite’s coming around now. Okay, they’re heading southeast on Holly Knoll Drive. They’re about 200 yards past mile marker 46. Okay, weird.
There’s another vehicle trying to push them off the road. Uh, okay, now both vehicles are off the roadway. They’re about 1/4 mile before marker 45.
What, to die in your arms?
Now we get paid equally.
Why not? You were right. We do the same thing.
I-I know. You put your life on the line.
No, I’m sure you deserve more. It’s just I have this this student loan and this online poker debt.
I’d do anything for you.
2011, Bangladesh. Fire broke out in a Dhaka ghetto sweatshop. Sixty-eight perished, 27 were children. Subsequent news coverage exposed horrific working conditions which were blamed by activists on the factory’s primary contractor, Fit Thread Jeans, and their CEO, haute couture designer, Cynthia Brooks. Now, the scandal rocked the industry.
Typhoid Mary.
Hey. Extra large cherry Slurpee says I can get Mr Cooper to say “You’re going to Fredericksburg.”
Okay, so, I think I found something. I’ve been combing through the security footage that the Paris police sent us from the bar, and watch this. Do you see it?
Hideous sweater. The coffee cup in the corner.
I think he’s watching Mr Reddington’s courier.
Okay, check it out. At 42 minutes and 11 seconds in, the courier gets up to go. Now, watch the sweater.
No, no, no. Watch, watch. See how long he’s holding the cup in front of his mouth? How he is trying to be discreet?
And following Mr Reddington’s courier out the door.
I can, and I did. Courtesy of new software I downloaded from FAVIAU. FAVIAU: Forensic Audio and Video Image Analysis Unit. The chief engineer and I are in a hacky sack circle.
Oh, yeah. They are making a huge comeback. Footbag workouts are actually a great cardiovascular exercise. It’s good for balance–
Right. [ Keyboard clacking ] Boom.
Yes. Charles “Chip” Murphy. Former NCIS agent. Delaware driver’s license.
No fixed address since his discharge five years ago. But he does own a storage unit in Fredericksburg, Virginia.
All right, the hotel takes photocopies of every guest’s passport. This is the person registered in room 21 the day of the murder.
Oh, no. It’s a fake. A very good one, but FACE Facial Recognition gave us another hit.
They both worked for this woman, Murphy as a private investigator, and Hart as an event planner.
Yeah, Gavin Pruitt, CEO of Pruitt Securities, one of the first big Wall Street pyramid schemes to go down in the late ’90s. Pruitt insisted he was innocent, but in the end, he was convicted on 11 felony counts Perjury, money laundering, securities fraud. Sentenced to 10 years at FCI Petersburg. In the end, he was stabbed to death by a fellow convict.
Oh, yeah, you’re right. Uh, from what I’ve been able to find, she’s been keeping up social appearances ever since her husband died. I did some digging on social media and found this.
Sorry. It’s not that. [ Chuckles ] All right, this is it. According to their event page, she is a major donor and will be at their fundraiser this afternoon at the Mandarin Oriental hotel.
One of the physician volunteers for the Sperry Medical Foundation was just arrested by Nigerian Customs for trying to smuggle $22 million in bonds held by one of Mr. Reddington’s shell corporations. Oh, man. It is all over the news. Sources allege that the charity’s a front to bypass inspections and move contraband between borders. The chairman of the foundation is Dr. Justin Sperry. And he is the keynote speaker at today’s charity gala.
Okay, we have a lead on Isabella Stone and the man we believe to be her next target, the chairman of the Sperry Medical Foundation. They’re on their way to his home in Falls Church right now.
Yeah, sending now, along with satellite imagery of the property.
Yes. Oh, and Sperry’s a paraplegic with a live-in nurse. I’ve tried calling a bunch of times, but, uh, no one’s picking up.
More like a ghost story. Black Mass is where the worst of the worst compete to see who can hack a set of security measures. The winner is supposed to be hired for the type of gig that you don’t come back from with a soul– CP, industrial sabotage– real horror show stuff. Multiple hits on a hexadecimal embedded in postings containing the words “black,” “mass,” and “13.” And we have– [ Taps key ] We have a GPS coordinate in Philadelphia.
No. This is just the first step down the rabbit hole. 
All right, guys, look for anything out of the ordinary.
Enter “then bar,” then an equal sign, then the words “binary arbitrary reason.”
1955 South Hartford, Havertown.
It’s all about pattern recognition. Just– Just keep your eyes open. 
Do you see anything weird?
Can you send me a photo?
Okay, I got it.
Okay, I got something. It’s a pickup point, I think. 248 Garfield. 3:20 PM. It says, “Come alone and wear a yellow hat.”
Yeah, but whoever we send in would have to really know their stuff. Not just the programming, but the buzzwords, the culture. It’s gonna–
No. I can’t, not after last time.
Which part, getting beaten to a pulp by my psycho girlfriend, or screaming our safe word like a baby who needs his diaper changed?
Are you getting the CCTV feeds?
And the, um, TAC team is standing by?
So when I ID The Architect, they’re gonna breach, right?
Uh, you know, if, um, the job’s right.
I’ve done, uh, some, you know. Uh, for cartels mostly. Not that you look like you work for a cartel. Maybe you do. Uh, how– how would I know? I’m–
Uh, excuse me. I think I see an old friend.
Elise, Excuse me. Um. Aren’t you supposed to be in jail?
Oh, really? I’m sorry. Am– Am I inconveniencing you?
Yes! Take that, biatch!
What do you mean “we”?
 Is that a remote code cypher? Are you trying to steal proprietary ideas?
She is not my girlfriend.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Who won that cage match?
The NSA? Are you kidding me?
I don’t know. My job was to ID him.
Yeah, I’m working on it, Elise. Or whatever you’re calling yourself this week. 
The Architect is gonna have the exits covered. But the mercs have radios, and if I can get one and I can get to the roof, I can notify the FBI.
If you think you’re that hot– Well, you are, but I don’t care. What I do care about is the lives of the people out there, so just– Okay. I need– I need something that burns. Oh, crap, come on. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Come on. [ Sighs ] This damn scarf.
Was any of it real?
What we did at night with the lights off? That was personal. The way you let me feel about you– I can’t think of anything more personal.
So help. Or don’t. I don’t care. Just, get out of my way.
No. She was.
Whoa. [ He takes the merc’s radio ]
To run? I’m not gonna do that.
Break emergency. I’m requesting an emergency autopatch relay to 9-1-1. 
The Architect has control of the convention. I count six mercs, heavily armed.
I don’t know exactly, but, um, gonna switch this radio to tone so you can trace my signal.
Okay, they’re here, they’re here.
Count me out.
[ To The Architect ] I know who you are, and that you’re willing to kill me if you have to. But you don’t know who I am. And I am not someone who’s gonna help you commit a crime.
I’m not gonna help you.
Samar!
Do you have any idea how many firewalls are built into a system like that?
Even if that’s true, the prison’s operating system is physically segregated from the Internet. Only way anyone could communicate with the software–
Please. You can’t do this.
If– If I set him free, more innocent people are gonna die.
Please, don’t–
Oh, that’s– I-I don’t– I-I– No. No, please–
Nothing– I just– If you shoot me, you’ll never be able to open the gate.
You can’t do this.
No, no, no, no! Watch him! He’s getting away! Don’t let him get away! No!
He escapes, more people die.
You don’t have to say that.
I killed a man today. And by killing him, I prevented us from interrogating him. From getting information on his other cases and clients, victims.
Hey, uh, Janet. Um. Uh, I’m probably only alive because of you, so thank you for that. It doesn’t make up for– you know. [ Pause ] You should go.
No. That– that can’t be true.
All right, the forensic accountant examined Panetti’s financials. And according to him, the $200,000 was paid to the Atlantic Coast Lepidopterology Research Institute.
Yeah, its website advertises it as a non-profit dedicated to the research of butterflies. But it’s not a 501(c)(3) and it’s not listed in any directory of non-profits that I can find. In fact, their entire board of directors is made up of stock photo models.
The 200K went into a Swiss bank account and has since been wired through dozens of other banks. The money has basically just disappeared into the ether by now.
Yeah, we’ve got nothing.
So that’s either a really, really bad coincidence or–
What’s the payout after 10 years?
Guys? This Apothecary, this guy is good.
He knew Helen Dahle. I’m sorry. Not know, know like he met her. He knew her medical history and he used it against her. Helen’s doctors think she went into a coma because of a reaction to a tree nut allergy, but the truth is, this Apothecary used some sort of complex, weaponized allergen to trigger the same reaction. Meaning her doctors–
Right, that– that is the bad news.
The lab did find one distinct element in the molecular structure of the drops taken from Robert Dahle’s apartment. A peptide unique to the venom of Bungarus flaviceps, also known as the red-headed krait [ a snake ] – Incredibly rare.
Only four suppliers in the world, and only one in America. A defunct reptile farm outside of Scranton, PA. Hightower Serpentarium. Owned by – Asa Hightower, who, according to his license, still lives in an apartment on site.
The closest one is Albee Baby in Harding. I’m sending you an address now. 
Hey. I, uh– Oh, uh, I didn’t think he was the flowers and balloons kind of guy. I was gonna go with wine, but then I remembered Mr. Reddington said he may have been poisoned with wine, so I, uh– And besides, who doesn’t like papaya?
You know, he has to be okay.
Oh, my God. [ Laughs ] Don’t do that.
Mmm No, that’s– that’s fine. Wait, how’d you get in?
I did?
I swear I locked it. Wait, I know I locked it.
Dembe, please. Please, don’t–
Okay, uh what is this?
You want me to hack it so you can steal from Mr. Reddington. No. I’m not gonna do that.
You’re trying to help him. Uh, then why not just tell him? He– he thinks you poisoned him.
So tell him.
That’s why you’re here. You think whoever accessed this locker is the person who tried to kill Mr. Reddington?
Okay, uh, fine. Uh– Okay, okay, these scanners usually use a syslog-d. That’s a-a program that stores a list of previous users. I’ll try to access that log, but I, uh, really don’t think we should be doing this behind Mr. Reddington’s back. Uh– Do you really need to still point that at me? I’m– I’m gonna help.
I did it, okay? Uh– Here’s the data you wanted. But–
I don’t know. The scanner uses proprietary encryption. I’m sorry, but it would take me days to crack this and figure out who, uh, accessed the– this locker. I’m so sorry.
I can go? Just like that?
Well, uh, there might be one way to get past the proprietary encryption. Are you really trying to help Mr. Reddington?
I have an idea. 
Agents Mojtabai and Zuma, FBI. We got a warrant to run a confiscated device through your proprietary decryption.
Yeah, we’re on a time crunch. It’s a matter of national security.
Zuma. Give the man the warrant. Don’t tell me you didn’t grab it off the desk. Oh, Zuma, you’re killin’ me.
Oh, you’re sorry. He’s sorry. Sorry, “sir. ”
It’s all right. That’s all right. Okay. You got somewhere we can sit and call this in? Court should be able to messenger a new one ASAP.
Oh, this is, uh, this is great. An agent will have a warrant here in– in no time. Thank you. Thanks so much.
All right, okay, that bought us maybe, like,– 15 minutes. If I’m lucky, I can find the encryption key before he gets back.
Well, it’s, uh, for Mr. Reddington. [ Tapping keys ] Right? Right. Okay. All right, here we go. 
Crap. Samar and Ressler are here.
Okay, come on. Downloading. All right, here we are. [ Typing ] [ Beeps ] Kathryn Nemec. Who is who is Kathryn Nemec?
Oh, is this bad? Oh, this seems bad.
Okay, uh, go. You better go. Do what you gotta do to help Mr. Reddington, but do it fast.
Locking down. [ Locks click ]
Sorry, uh, I can’t.
[ Tapping key ] Okay. Got to open that door. Yes, okay. Closing now.
Dembe. No. No, no. Ressler, no.
He needed my help.
We’re on the Reddington task force, and the one person Dembe can’t get near right now is Mr. Reddington.
He might if he felt Dembe betrayed him. I don’t think Dembe did, but everything is pointing towards that, so you know, there’s no telling what Mr. Reddington might do.
Honestly, I don’t know. We found a name– Kathryn Nemec.
Hey. Are you okay? Are you hurt?
No.
I, uh– I can’t leave right now. Can we talk later?
Come on. I’ll walk you out. 
Yeah, she disappeared in 1991, just dropped off the grid. Lived at a few addresses in the Midwest in her 30s. Worked at an exclusive domestic staffing agency, but then one day she’s just gone. And there is no more record.
Dembe seemed to think so.
Yeah, I cannot explain it, but had you seen Dembe’s face when he saw her name – It was like he’d seen a ghost. 
Agent Mojtabai.
Mr. Reddington.
Attacked?
Is Dembe gonna be okay?
We did. We found a name. Kathryn Nemec.
Kathryn Nemec. But she’s been missing since 1991.
Should’ve told you about Janet.
It does to me. I-I’m sorry that I’m– Hey. Can I tell you something I admire about you?
Your intensity. The way you talk and think. The way you do the job.
I don’t just admire it. I’m also terrified by it. And by what it would do to me if we got too close.
Ms. Panabaker’s here and she does not look happy.
No kidding. That- that is so fantastic.
She can’t hate me forever, right?
Sorry to interrupt, but Agent Keen told us about Mr. Kaplan, and I need to ask. Is it true that you shot her because she tried to help Agent Keen and her family escape to a normal life?
Sir, Mr. Reddington was right. 20 seconds after he left, the owner of the boot store made a call. I’m tracing it now, but the root package is hidden within multiple layers of encryption.
I’ll do it. Agent Navabi has her interview for Katai Fellowship today.
Uh, I got a hit on the trace. It’s a pay phone near a construction site in Anacostia.
It’s a rental. The bar code’s used for scanning the vehicle in and out. We found a local company that rented a green SUV to a woman matching Philomena’s description.
Actually, the rental company already enabled the stolen vehicle recovery feature for us. We’ve tracked the target heading south on 210. Agents Keen and Navabi are en route.
Because you’d be perfect for
That’s amazing.
You do.
Agent Keen, I think I speak for all of us when I say my recollection of the last memory specialist we dealt with was not a pleasant one.
Hey, you guys, okay, so after Krilov didn’t show up at the hotel, Mr. Cooper issued an APB, and it paid off.
Well, a transit cop spotted him on a subway platform, but lost him in a crowd. So I pulled the security feeds from the street outside the station.
I agree, and these days, we don’t really agree on anything so, you know, it’s gotta be good advice.
Yeah, I don’t think they’re colleagues. It looks like she’s his target.
Hey. Dr. Orchard was right. Her equipment may help us find Krilov.
The EEG machine he stole from her is state-of-the-art. It’s designed to receive updates from a main server.
Which we can use to locate the machine, and Krilov, once he turns it on.
Yeah, Mr. Cooper did. Um, what is Mr. Reddington going to do with it? 
The equipment he’s using, Dr. Orchard’s EEG, it is pinging the manufacturer’s server. I am tracking the signal now.
Yeah. Unfortunately.
A clinic in Rockville, Maryland. Shut down nearly a decade ago.
Wait, Agent Ressler? I thought he was in Philadelphia.
All right, I have the address. Routing backup to meet you there now.
You said the Senator wanted the dealer to die exactly the way his daughter died.
So exactly where did she die? Long Beach, under the pier.
Okay, Mr. Cooper, are you ready? [ Typing ] Okay, here we go.
We’re hoping the victim or some trace evidence on the victim may help lead to his capture.
[ Typing ]
Line two. [ Presses button ]
Grant works at Horizon Middle School in Fairfax County.
On a hunch, I ran the Long Beach police logs the night Obermeir vanished, and it turns out a pickup truck was cited for a broken taillight four blocks from where Obermeir’s body was found.
Yeah, I remember. It was a huge news story.
I thought he was sentenced to life.
Sir, I could be wrong, but, uh, I think I might know where Agent Keen is. Some kids at Horizon Middle School reported seeing a woman matching Mr. Kaplan’s description, and she was holding a key ring that said “Troop 1-4-4-4-1.” And their old cabin is on Johnson Lake.
 [ Inhales deeply ] Oh, it’s exhilarating. I can actually feel my body releasing endorphins.
Race walking.
It’s an Olympic sport.
See, this is why you’re so good for me. I never exercise this much. I feel amazing.
Uh uh, yeah?
Is this about the task force? Did– did everyone get one of these?
Did I have a choice?
Yeah, I have nothing to say about that.
Immunity? To testify against my friends who, uh, may, uh, or may not work for a task force that may or may not even, uh, exist. Yeah, uh, I’m not doing that. I don’t have to do that, right?
How- how can they do that, take away my Constitutional right by granting me something that I don’t want? I- I don’t want immunity. You can- Um, I refuse, uh, to let you grant it. Consider me ungranted.
Gift? To turn on my friends. My alleged friends.
Yeah, but is, uh, that so terrible? I mean, um, it’s not good, but, uh, the task force is legal. He can’t get a grand jury to indict us for working on it.
Yeah, but he can’t prove it. Uh, not unless one of us testifies that it’s true, which– which, uh, none of us would ever do.
Yeah, but whether Gale can prove it or not and, um, I’m not– I’m not– I’m not saying that he can because, I mean, if I have anything to do with it, he will not. Whatever. I’m just– I’m proud of the work that we’ve done here.
Probably macadamias. When stolen, uh, by truckload, they’re actually quite lucrative, so Uh, fun fact.
I do, and it is an absolute maze. Okay, if I’m reading this right, he could access half the city using these tunnel lines.
Mr Cooper. Um, can I talk to you for a second?
It’s not, but–
Sir, I’ve been subpoenaed to testify in front of a grand jury. I’m not supposed to tell you because you’re a target of the investigation.
Everyone. Julian Gale’s convinced the US Attorney that we’ve broken the law. Sir, he’s coming after us. All of us.
[ Breathing unevenly ] This is a mistake.
…Uh, I do.
Um, Aram Mojtabai, and I am an FBI agent.
Yeah I’m not really supposed to talk about my work, so–
Stop Mr. Reddington? Well, if you knew him, you’d know that’s that’s basically impossible.
I-I–
I-I didn’t say that. No, no–
That’s not accurate, what you’re saying.
Okay, you know what? Fine. I’m proud of the work we do with Mr. Reddington. Yeah, I’m proud of it. You heard me. Yes, his world is absolutely terrifying …
… but it exists.
And the only reason we know that is because Reddington is the one who helps
us take down the very worst people in it!
You don’t– Okay.
Okay, okay, fine. Do you know how we have to do that? [ Handcuffs click ] We have to make choices. Write that down. You wanna put us on trial? Give us a trial. Let us have a chance to present a defense. We’ll see what happens then.
[ To Janet ] I-I told you this was a mistake.
I’m totally freaking out in here. And I’m half-Muslim, which is definitely not a plus.
Uh, nothing. It’s, uh- Thank you, it’s fine.
Look, Janet’s been amazing. I know you hate her, which is why I didn’t wanna say anything, but the fact is, is I’m barely hanging on in here, and if it wasn’t for her– Not that it even matters, because Mr. Kaplan is gonna testify tomorrow afternoon, and when she does, there’s, um there’s nothing I can do to protect you.
Is that what you came to tell me?
Really? That’s That’s incredibly thoughtful.
I’m sorry, you what?
Thank you, sir, that means a lot.
When you came to see me in jail why didn’t you tell me Janet was the reason I was in there?
Hold up. Agent Navabi.
Yeah, um, 100%, but, um, we agreed to keep it professional at work.
Oh, my God. I forgot my bike.
In the shop. I cracked the hub on the Rolf wheel, so, uh, took a taxi.
They’re gonna find out that Mr. Reddington’s empire has been decimated.
What does that mean?
Excuse me, um, sir? I’m wondering if, uh, you decided to tell the new director about Agent Keen and Mr. Reddington’s relationship.
So you think the Bureau should be kept informed about personal relationships? 
The National Security Advisor.
I’m sending you everything I got from the database matching that criteria– 6’1″, tattooed neck, white supremacist with known ties to the Lone Star State.
Okay, got it. By the way, Mr. Cooper told us about you and Mr. Reddington. Most people are really happy to have a lawyer in the family. You’ve got a master criminal. How cool is that?
Okay.  Odin Neiland. He did five years at FCI Lewisburg for distribution of methamphetamines. Wait, Liz, hang on a second. Okay, this guy has ties to Roman LeMarc. Okay, LeMarc runs a neo-Nazi outfit called the Friedrich Brigade. They are a ruthless, Mafia-style crime syndicate that smuggles drugs through the federal prison system.
[ Keyboard clacking ]
Agent Navabi and I we’re, um – [ hesitates ]
Yes. And if, uh, that’s gonna be a problem, you know, with the higher-ups, then, uh, I’d be willing to–
Uh, not much, and according to Mr. Reddington, that is the appeal. Apparently, it’s an upscale affair run by Juric and Bauer, the boutique auction house which is hosting the event in Zagreb.
Fortunately, the company uses a computer system to log guests. I was able to locate their servers and add a new profile.
Yasmin Shahidi, the only daughter of an Iranian textile manufacturer who made a fortune selling private estates in Beverly Hills.
So Mr. Reddington gave the forgery to Blaise as a gift, then set him up to get arrested with it?
It was registered to another owner who reported it stolen three weeks ago, Stansbury was never a suspect.
Yeah, people without the cognitive ability to know they’re being duped.
Well, maybe. Or uh, maybe it’s just a really odd coincidence. But Waterday doesn’t just buy structured settlements, they also make loans. And some of the loans they make are to cops. And just last month, one of the cops who had gotten a loan is Officer McGinnis.
Yeah, a cop who had gotten a loan from Waterday shot a man who had gotten his settlement bought by them.
But since it wasn’t, we reviewed the class-action lawsuit that Stansbury was a part of.  Now, out of 179 plaintiffs, four sold their settlements to Waterday. Stansbury and these three
Two were shot by police after high-speed chases. The other charged an officer with a knife. Suicide by cop.
Loans that, as far as we can tell, they’ve never paid back.
[ On phone ] Based on the insurance records, I think maybe I figured out who the next target is.
Oh, no, but they take out a ton of it. Life-insurance policies on the lives of the people whose settlements they buy.
That’s true, Waterday lost a few thousand on the settlement payouts, but they took out a $5 million policy on Stansbury’s life. So when he died, they made a fortune.
Uh, yes and no. First, Waterday had policies on all of the people whose structured settlements they bought, not just the victims. And second the victims. It looks like they pick ones who are living on “borrowed time.” Cancer victims, addicts, people whose illnesses may explain the type of erratic behavior that could result in a deadly altercation with the police.
Yes. Based on the three knowns – the recipient of a structured settlement, a preexisting medical condition, and a large insurance policy on their life – I found one name in the Waterday database – Robert Urwiller.
[ On phone ]  Agent Keen, I’ve got Urwiller’s car heading east on Irving Street.
You are looking for a 1994 tan Toyota Tercel which just made a left on Georgia.
I tried at least a dozen times Trying again now.
Mr. Cooper, I just spoke with Agent Ressler and gave him Agent Keen’s 10-20. He’s en route as we speak.
Uh, not yet, but we’re still trying.
Copy that.
Yep. Caleb Hess – CEO of an international security contracting firm based in Hanover, Maryland.
Okay, according to the Diplomatic Security Service, Princess Sonya is here in DC to deliver a speech at the UNESCO Conference, and she has a room block at the Greylock Hotel in downtown DC under the name Elise Wolf.
Incredible, right? That is why it is known as golden blood.
Okay. So, 99% of us have high-prevalence antigens in our blood. If the ones who don’t receive a transfusion from the ones who do, the incompatibility can prove fatal. So, finding a donor for people with rare blood types, like the princess, is super difficult. And if they’re in a crisis, I can only imagine it would be a desperate race against the clock.
With any rare blood types. It is the only known universal donor which, obviously, makes its life-saving capabilities enormous.
And, according to the Rare Blood Database, two have gone missing within the last three months.
In this country, I see one. Ethan Isaacs, currently in the ICU at DC Mercy Hospital.
All right, after reviewing Ethan’s medical file, I found something interesting. Prior to 2011, it’s blank.
Exactly. The Isaacs adopted Ethan in 2010 through an NGO that briefly brought Syrian children to the U.S. Ethan Isaacs was born Shahir Ahmad in 2008 in Dahar, Syria, to this woman – Nirah Ahmad.
And adoption records indicate that she has the same rare blood type as her son. And in a war-torn country like Syria, she must’ve known that a golden blood has almost no chance of surviving a traumatic injury.
To fight for her country. She was an active member of the Free Syrian Army until she disappeared in 2014.
When I ran her photo against the images taken from the traffic cams near the hospital, I found this.
I am still working on that.
And it’s not just the blood she’ll need. Myocarditis requires a heart transplant. And in order for his body not to reject it, the heart needs to come from another golden blood.
Okay, hold on. I think I may have just figured this out. Okay, the street address you gave me was zoned as a zoological research facility, but construction was put on hold due to this ongoing court battle. However, if I’m reading these permits right, it looks like the only section of the facility that was okayed was the second story. Agents Ressler and Samar are en route, maybe 10 minutes out.
Okay, hang on. Okay, Mr. Reddington says it’s been 15 months. Well, in that time, Surkov has taken credit for three attacks – a downed plane on a humanitarian mission to Boko Haram victims, a Paris café demolished by a C-4 suitcase bomb, and yesterday’s chemical-plant attack.
Raqaan Ghaffari. He’s in charge of demolition for Lignes D’Avenir, a mid-sized contractor in Belgrade.
All right, you’ll have us on comms, but to pick up Ghaffari, this mic well, it’s gonna need to be close. All right? So– There. I’ll let you, you know–
I know.
 Please, just, uh– be careful.
Loud and clear. This is definitely our guy.
Oh, my gosh. No. Who are these guys? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Crap, crap. No!
Stop. Wait!
I don’t know how to drive.
Agent Ressler, m-maybe you could slow down a little bit? Uh– there’s an alley. Alley! Alley ahead! Alley ahead!
Oh. Oh, God.
Watch out.
Hold on.
Watch out. Watch out. Come on!
They crashed. They crashed.
Oh, God.
No, it’s not.
Are you sure you’re all right?
Sir? Uh, Director Cox. Hello. Uh, the only prints they could pull from the safe house in Pančevo were partials, but we got a match. Uh, the man we’re looking for, Agent Reuther, uh, his real name is Agent Brian Osterman.
All right, hang on. Okay, I have a Cyclone-class patrol ship.
14 ships 10 are deployed in the Persian Gulf, 3 are doing drug interdiction off the coast of Florida, and this last one– Okay, yeah, the USS Parnell is at its home port.
Norfolk.
All right, I’ve notified Port Authority and Naval Installations Command. They’re initiating a Level 4 lockdown and emergency evac protocols for all non-essential personnel.
Nothing yet. I am still waiting to get approval from Security Command to share their CCTV feeds.
Um, Agent Keen? I think I might have something here. NCIS just got a ping on an alias that Calhoun was able to confirm was one of Osterman’s. It appears access has been granted to a Human Resources office between Powhatan Ave and Pier 11.
Hey, uh– about, uh, what happened in Belgrade–
When, um, Agent Navabi was taken– uh, she could’ve been hurt. She wasn’t. She’s fine, obviously. But, uh– I wasn’t prepared, sir. I didn’t know how to react. And then, with the shootout at the safe house–
No, no, you don’t understand. I don’t want to be unprepared. Mr. Cooper, sir. I’d like to request to be operationally trained, sir.
Mitchell David Dunning. Lives in Dupont Circle and imports high-end furniture. Offices in Paris, London, and New York.
The Seawall Travel Agency, based out of Allentown, Pennsylvania, was a storefront used by Knobbs and Dunning to facilitate their murder-for-hire business.
Yeah, who hid their association behind a ton of financial loopholes.
Yep. And according to some of the other documents you seized, they had a large support staff who were doing far more than booking eight-day cruises to Acapulco.
So, evidently, Seawall shell companies were also secretly paying account executives, private investigators, weapons-procurement techs, and a variety of what I can only assume were handlers.
Except for one. Mr. Argon Wright, a shipping agent out of Baltimore.
There is only one number that’s been calling that pager – each page coming on the same day as a killing.
Yeah, all over it.
Yeah. Some are only alive because he got them away from, you know, whatever they were running from.
We’ll stay in touch via this device I can embed in your rear molar. It works like a microphone and allows me to pick up your voice.
Yeah, that’s- that’s right. Um, how’d you know that?
Uh, don’t you also speak, like, five languages?
You know, other than the fact that you sometimes have to kill people for a living, you’re, like, my role model. Open up.
I do. We are up and live.
He’s gonna crush it.
They operate out of Bulgaria, protected by the older Kilgannon’s political connections.
Yeah, they just crossed the border using a series of tunnels along the Suva Reka River.
[ Over comms ] Hey, Dembe. Everything is okay here. We’ve got a solid fix on your location.
All right, I clock multiple warehouses, rail cars, trucks – a lot of movement.
Guys, this place is the perfect cover – a shipping complex housing over a dozen corporations. Everything from smart-phones to frozen fish. Shipping containers moving in and out. How would anybody know some of them are packed with people?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We just lost the connection.
I can’t.
Uh, everyone, uh, I think we might have another problem here. The truck in the photo you sent – Is it the same size and style as the one we think Dembe’s on?
It’s a refrigerated truck, meaning its cargo bay is airtight. If the truck stops running–
Actually, it’s- it’s not the oxygen that’s the problem, sir. It’s the carbon dioxide we breathe out. 3% is fatal to humans. When the air reaches 3% CO₂, everyone inside will asphyxiate.
Hang on. The truck’s cargo bay is just under 1000 cubic feet. The average person produces about 1.7 cubic feet of CO₂ per hour, times 15 people. Maybe 2½ hours.
[ Walking over ] I don’t know where Tom went after the motel, but I do know where he was before he went there. A gas station on Highway 211, east of Warrenton.
I hacked the navigation system on his car. Uh, so, now it may be a coincidence, but based on the time log, it looks as if he was there at the same time the station was being vandalized.
We got a match on the VIN number from Mr. Smith’s car. His real name is Peter Alan McGee, resident of Largo, Maryland.
Yes, and not because of priors, which he has, but because he’s wanted for questioning in the murder of one – Nik Korpal.
Well, according to police records, McGee received a call from Nik on the night of his death, just two hours before his body was found.
Hey, we got a hit. The detectives investigating McGee were just called to a site with multiple homicides. Absolutely horrific scene, but they were able to confirm one of the victims – Peter Alan McGee.
Well, they didn’t, um, uh–
Mr. Reddington?
No. Why?
Might explain why she’s missing.
She was with Agent Ressler at a crime scene following up on a lead, looking for Tom when she she just vanished.
Yes. She’s not picking up. Her cell is going straight to voicemail. Um, in fact, I think she may have shut off the GPS signal in her phone, because when I tried to track her, it’s gone.
We’re looking. When I couldn’t get a trace, I pulled the call log from her service provider. It appears that the last call she received was just under 12 minutes ago from a pay phone at Union Station.
They did to terrorists in Toronto, Barcelona, and Paris. We know these accounts are financing terrorism. What we don’t know is the identity of the account holders.
All right, the list was apparently on the classified computers at the Senate Intelligence Committee. Now, Senator Cooligan insists he was at dinner last night when his badge and password were used to access the classified computers.
All right. 11 members. All with some level of restricted access. Two are out of the country, and six others have solid alibis with Capitol Police.
Two of them are waiting to be cleared for questioning because they are also working for the Committee.
Right. Howard Ray Bishop. Political aide who has held positions with State, Treasury, FDA–
I do, and he is not using it. If Bishop’s on a cell, it’s either not registered in his name or it’s a burner.
Copy that. Coms are up.
I’m really worried about her.
To find your husband’s killer? That’s actually sort of sweet.
Or had a hair out of place or even a wrinkle in his suit. Agent Ressler, you know you’d make an amazing criminal. If you were a crooked cop, no one would ever know.
We believe the buyer is Rosmin Hamzah, a Bruneian national with extremist ties in Southeast Asia.
Well, based on the names Mr Reddington provided, we put out an alert. TSA flagged Hamzah 12 hours ago at Dulles under an assumed name, and Bureau agents have since tracked him to a hotel in Dupont Circle.
The victim was Jasmine Perez, an MPDC Internal Affairs Investigator.
“Pennies” – wasn’t there only one?
The lost Federal Reserve Notes that Treasury claims it never made.
Three security guards murdered at the Sharjah Museum in Dubai, an Italian art collector dies when his home is consumed by a fire set by an unknown arsonist, and just last night, an antiques dealer murdered in Georgetown.
I think it sounds like fun.
Okay. Check this out. I think I may have located the fourth penny. All right, after the coins were minted, they disappeared for about 30 years. No record of them anywhere. But then, in 1975, they started to appear at auctions. The missing penny was last sold in 1984, and, according to the bill of sale, the man who bought it passed away two years ago.
Yes, and it was included in an extensive art collection that he left to the University of Pennsylvania.
Yes and no. I spoke to the head of donations at the university, and she says the coin is on loan at the Gabor Museum.
Agent Keen. Please, uh– Please tell me you’re back. Obviously, you’re here, so you’re back, but are you back or just here?
Mr. Reddington has us working on this insane treasure hunt–
No, do you remember that penny that he got in that elaborate scheme–
You need to come back.
I’m [ CHUCKLING ] so sorry. That’s my fault. I didn’t–
I, uh– Okay. You know, it’d be a distraction.
From looking for Tom’s killers.
Mr. Reddington’s penny– There are four of them. Now, the Blacklister has three out of the four of them, and Agents Ressler and Navabi are en route to the Gabor Museum to find the fourth one.
Talk about a distraction. [ CHUCKLES ]
Stern, Abraham J. He’s a loan officer at the Republic Commerce Bank in Manhattan.
If you’re upside down on your loan, Stern tries to work out a new payment schedule.
The linen truck that hit Mr. Reddington’s car that company is a client of Stern’s bank, and the insurance investigator that paid a visit to the Gabor Museum, he’s also a client risking foreclosure.
Does he know how many fires?
The arson investigator slash arsonist?
All right. We’re still searching nationally, but so far we’ve found four fires under investigation with the same inverted pentagram and inscription.
He does, behind a barely burned wall. That is his M.O. Everything burns hot and fast except one wall. Gave us enough to narrow our search.
Seven. And if you’re looking for a common denominator among the victims, good luck. A married couple in Bethesda, an insurance executive outside Chicago, a mother and son burned to death in an apartment fire in Brooklyn.
It seems that he’s only missed once, when he burned down a small ranch house in Tenleytown. The owner is an ER doctor – Corrine Egan.
Okay, so Fagen told you The Cook liked to stay and watch, right? Well, it turns out he did. A neighbor told a first responder after the Chicago fire that he noticed a red Honda parked across the street from the victim’s house, which got me thinking. If there are fires in different cities, how did the killer get there?
I checked, and there are only two rental companies in that city using Hondas, and only one with a model in candy apple red on the streets that night rented to a William Seavers, Baltimore address.
The security footage from Havershim Hardware – this is from two days ago.
It looks like the letter “T.”
All right. The Cook is a priest. The quote you saw in blacklight is from Romans, the second from John. To see what else might be written behind those walls, I had the lab run thermographic scans and found this. It’s the cross from the Traditum Church.
Yep. Traditum Primarius “Tradition First.” It is an extremely fringe order.
They won’t release official numbers, but their Temple is in Cromwell, just a few miles outside of Arlington.
Okay, hang on. Searching.
All right. Oh, okay. I’ve got a Thomas Owen Wattles on Fisher Drive in Pimmit Hills.
Wait a second. Hang on here. I think the Bureau’s facial recognition software may have just found a match with the CCTV footage from the airport hotel. Okay, Claire Anne Homan, 26, graphic designer at a boutique firm in Arlington.
Copy, sir.
So, I’ve been trying the woman from the hotel bar, Claire Homan.
I can’t get through. Sir, I, uh I have a bad feeling about this. I think Wattles may already be there.
Trying to make contact. Still no answer on her cell. VSP and Fire are en route.
Okay, just hurry.
Brenford – Okay. Uh, their biggest employer was the Atria Chemical Corporation. Whoa. They dumped so many toxins that the EPA set up the site, 10 square miles of uninhabitable land.
I know, right? ­They’re like slim to none, which is probably why it didn’t happen. I looked at 730 photos. No cars in the foreground on the road, but one photo had something in the background, and I enhanced it.
All right, this is David Flynn, the personal injury lawyer from Philly. The other body was Judge Waybur. Both men have a connection to the ghost town where the bodies were found. Waybur spent his entire career hearing cases in the City of Brenford, and before Flynn moved to Philadelphia, he was the general counsel of the Atria Corporation, the chemical company that poisoned Brenford.
I had the same question. Flynn appeared before Judge Waybur to defend Atria in one case.
I can’t say. The records are sealed under court order.
Another plaintiff sought to have the case unsealed almost 15 years ago and failed.
No. All I have is the name of the person who tried – Stephen Altman.
Stephen Altman was raised in Brenford. His parents died of bone cancer, supposedly as a result of Atria’s chemical spills. Stephen was a teenager when he sued Atria for wrongful death. Ultimately, his case was dismissed for failure to meet the burden of proof. I can’t find any record of him over the last two years – no taxes paid, no driver’s license, no address.
Probably. I’m working on it now. Fortunately, the device they’re using is a three-axis accelerometer – on steroids. It doesn’t just track front-to-back and left-to-right, it also tracks up-and-down.
Yeah, I think whoever The Invisible Hand is watching is currently at this point in space 282 feet above the ground, and I’ve been roughing out a 3-D simulation of the Braxton Hotel, and if I can superimpose it over the tracking point then that is the 17th floor.
[ Over phone ] All right, the guest is Anna Hopkins. She’s Executive Vice President of Optimize, a European company that specializes in green energy initiatives.
Yeah, and apparently after Atria shut down, she accepted a job in London and has been overseas ever since.
And it looks like she’s just in town to give a speech announcing a new product that her company’s working on.
That allow people to be in two places at once.
That’s what I thought. Until–
And here we go. There.
Yes. Except it’s not. Facial recognition software says it is only an 81% match with discrepancies in vein pattern, eye distance, and pitch of the lower lip.
Oh, the system could be wrong, but if it’s right and I suspect that it is then you are looking at an exceptionally convincing double who helped Sam DeMarco get away with murder.
And out of the 840, 582 are licensed to men. Any of whom could be our Blacklister.
Down to the kind of lottery ticket he was supposed to buy the day of the murder.
You think Sinclair’s murdering the doppelgangers?
We now have at least twice as many murders to charge him with.
There’s another? 
Okay, so, uh, our facial recognition software wasn’t able to pull a match on the mold, but Agents Ressler and Navabi were able to find additional points of comparison at Sinclair’s workshop.
But not the client, because, okay, I think I think I just found him. Brian Barrett, 33. An aerospace engineer working for a defense contractor in Greenbelt, Maryland. Married to a Nicole Rose Adler. Two kids. Looks like the wife filed for divorce five months ago.
Sir, what about the double?
[ On phone ] Okay, I was able to access the GPS on Nicole Adler’s vehicle, and she just stopped. I’ve got her at what appears to be a parking garage off Westpark Drive and Tyson’s Corner.
What? Oh. Uh, no. Uh, sorry, I was just watching Agent Keen. It’s, uh– it’s good to have you back. Even if it’s on restricted duty.
We just got word of NYPD responding to a call at New York General.
Yes, but there may be more– Another- another outbreak. They found some kind of biological device.
Okay, hang on. I got an ID. Here we go. Captain Patricia Sue Edwards. Uh, she’s a biochemist. Formerly with the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease.
Married to Lieutenant Commander Dennis Edwards. NAVY Seal.
Yeah, well, put a pin in that. ‘Cause in March 2017, Lieutenant Commander Edwards was stationed in Manbij, Syria, tasked with securing the area to facilitate the liberation of Raqqa. His record had always been exemplary, up until another SEAL caught him stealing a truck full of confiscated opium.
Killed. By the same SEAL who caught him. And Judge Advocate ruled that that SEAL was acting in self-defense.
Uh, yeah, but nothing conclusive but she was stripped of her security clearance at USAMRIID before resigning her commission.
All right, code is code – ones and zeroes. What’s changed is that we can now manipulate the human genome to implant malicious code into it. When the infected DNA from the victims was analyzed and uploaded to the CDC’s network, the computer virus was uploaded with it.
The only way I can see for sure what she’s doing inside the system is to physically access the server farm.
Sir, uh, that’s what I would like to do. There’s just one small problem –
This is the quarantine zone, and this –
– This is the server farm that supplies the CDC’s computer system.
Got it. So, uh, what you’re saying is if the virus doesn’t kill me, the suit will.
I have to pee. Kidding. I’m totally kidding. Just come on, I’m trying to lighten the mood here. It’s– Oh. Okay.
I see it. How am I doing on oxygen?
Nine minutes, huh?
Dr. Moshay, this is probably as good a time as any to tell you I admire the CDC and the work you do. But perhaps one of your scientists could, you know, could find a way to equip these hazmats with a – you know, a simple, uh, inline recirculating fan to cool them off a bit. Oh! Okay, I found it. I found it. D-52. We’re here. Okay. Okay.
All right, I need the root password.
Let me see I can’t really see through this mask. [ COMPUTER BEEPS ]  Okay, I’m in. I’m in. All right, now I’m, uh- [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] scanning for unknown processes.
I am. I just I can’t see here. So–
I gorged on apple cobbler.
I breathed.
Uh, Samar, this is, um this is, like, super cool of you I know you’re helping, but I figured it out. She’s jumped the system.
Okay, government computer systems are networked, and if what I’m seeing here is right, then Edwards is using the CDC portal to launch a search in SIPRNet and the DoD.
That’s just it. She’s using some kind of DNA sample in her search. It’s not a “what.” It’s “who.” I think she’s looking for somebody.
Yeah, she has some DNA and she’s looking to put a name to it.
Tell me. What can I do?
I’ll geolocate him.
Okay – come on. All right, I’m geolocating now.
Okay, okay, okay All right, it looks like there. There. 447 Skidmore.
Is there a problem?
Okay. I’m on it.
Okay, guys, a traffic cam clocked Cronin’s vehicle three minutes ago, heading westbound on 495. I’ve got an NYPD unit tailing them now.
Hence the name Capricorn. Sign of the goat.
Uh, protective custody?
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You know who killed Tom, and it was a cop?
No. I mean, yes, sir, about the transfer, but about Tom – why would a US Marshal want him dead?
Excuse me. Hello there. I’m here about Tony Mejia.
Uh, oh, I’ve got signed transfer orders. Uh, agents from the DC field office should be here any minute. Uh, he’s an eyewitness in the death of a police officer.
That’s right. Oh, I’m sorry. I did. Uh, briefly. In- In passing. Seemed like a good man.
I’m sorry. I-I thought you–
Federal Agent Mojtabai. Uh, wh-what did you say your name was again?
I’m- I’m sure it was.
I’m a-afraid I cannot let you do that. Uh, send me a-a transcript, that is. You won’t have to because, uh, the witness I’m- I’m putting him in protective custody.
Who? Um, I’m just- I’m just doing as I was told.
I would if I could, really.
First of all, it’s, uh, more of a golden brown. It’s a topaz. Topaz, really. And, um, secondly, uh, pardon my French, but you can back the hell off. Please, bring out my witness.
Yes, I was. Not anymore.
I know you’re scared. I would be, too. Of being here. Of what you saw. But you know you don’t have to be. We’re here to protect you. It’s our job. And the people I work with, they’re, like they are, like, really, really good at it. All right, so, now I’m going to show you some photos.
Yes, of the victim. Of Detective Singleton. But these photos contain the man who we believe killed Detective Singleton. And if you recognize him, I want you to point him out, okay?
All right, take your time. The man you saw in the alley. The man you saw murder Detective Singleton. Do you see that man in any of these photos?
Thank you. For agreeing to do this. You know you don’t have to.
Yes, it is.
I think your grandma will be very proud of you.
You serious? I love Doritos. Wait. Which is your favorite? Mine – Spicy Nacho. Unless I’m depressed. Then I mainline Jacked 3D Bacon Cheddar Ranch. [ CHUCKLES ]
Guys. Whoa! Hey, guys!
Whoever it was, they came out of nowhere.
I know, but it happened really fast. They overwhelmed us, and they boxed us in.
No, not gone. He’s missing, and we’re gonna get him back. We’re gonna get him back.
Liz, Liz, no. Listen. So, look, I’ve pulled all of the feeds, and, uh, now, the vans were unmarked. There were no plates, but–
I’m doing- I’m–
I’m not gonna stop until I can prove Garvey did this. He won’t get away with it.
I promised that we would protect him – that I would protect him.
Tony Mejia was gonna testify that he saw Ian Garvey murder a cop. And thanks to me he probably never will.
Oh, uh – it was my grandmother’s. Amethyst is Samar’s birthstone.
 What? [ CHUCKLES ] No. No, no, no, no, no, no! This is not an engagement ring. It’s just a ring.
That’s insane. How can she think it’s a proposal if I- if I do not propose?
Apparently, I don’t, either.
Yeah. I, uh I want to ask you about, uh, – the feeds from when I lost Tony Mejia.
Trying and failing, with the I.D. and the surveillance feeds. Three different feeds from three different businesses all blacked out 10 minutes before the attack.
The feeds are worthless.
We’re back to square one.
And Mr. Reddington?
[ On phone ] Okay. Uh, thank you. [ PEN CLICKS ] Okay, so, uh, I’m sure it’s nothing, but the forensic lab just called. They have new information on the ambush.
Okay, we need to take this. I need to open this up and see exactly what we’re dealing with.
Liz [ CHUCKLES ] Uh, so, um okay, so, there’s this ring, and, uh, I wanted to give it to Samar. But Ressler seems to think that, if I do, she’ll think that I’m proposing. He thinks that, because we’ve dated more than a year, that any woman would think that, but I disagree. And, uh, you’re, you know, any woman. What do you think?
Or if she doesn’t? You mean, like, now or like, ever?
Yeah. But if she doesn’t, which is it?
Her files had been wiped, but using a flashing module, I was able to track some of her online activity, and I found this. [ KEYS CLACKING ] It’s an underground chat room of sorts. I can see 83 members, all girls under 18, all legally married.
Everywhere. Child marriage is happening all over the world.
And before you say, “It couldn’t happen here,” it does. Half our states have no age limit. More than 200,000 American children were married in the last 15 years. Apparently, all that’s needed is parental consent or judicial approval.
That is not all they talk about. They also talk about her [ KEYS CLACKING ] – a guardian angel, sort of like a mythic white knight that appears to set them free.
Nine of the girls in Reva’s group have husbands who have been killed or died in accidents.
Samar – you okay?
That is how Garvey stole the witness. Based on the digital signature, I’m pretty sure it was made by the same person who created the next-gen surveillance gear used by the Invisible Hand.
No, that part makes sense. What doesn’t is how he got it into the engine bay of a car in our motor pool. The vehicle never left the building. So, either Garvey got in–
Or he knows someone who can.
You didn’t answer my question.
Hey. [ KNOCKS ON WALL ] All right, so, this is the composite sketch of the man I saw take our witness.
No. But, um, I was talking to Samar, and [ KEYS CLACKING ] –
And risk finding out that she doesn’t want to be with me? Um, no.
Uh, yeah, that really hasn’t been my experience. I’m, uh, sort of more a more of a catch and release. Okay. All right. Point being, “A,” she would crush me, and, “B,” I realized that someone put the remote access device on the transport vehicle while it was in the motor pool.
I did, and I found nothing inside the building. Maybe they looped the feed or found a way to avoid the camera. I don’t know, and I don’t care, because outside the building, I found this guy – here it is – walking towards the post office. And he and this guy are the same person. I got nothing off the sketch, but at least we now have his photo. Crazy, right? Eyes like a wolf [ One eye blue, the other brown ]. I’m running it through NCIC to find his connection to Garvey.
Why not?
How do you know that?
And until he does, it seems that Mr Reddington will do whatever he can to protect Garvey, including steal a material witness right out from under us. We figured Mr Reddington would try to move him, try to get him as far away from Garvey as possible. So, we put a BOLO out to every private airfield on the East Coast.
What exactly did you see?
Officer- Officer, what are you doing?
Wow. Palm Thai. What is what is the occasion?
No, no, no. Thai is good. Thai is- No, That’s great. It’s, uh, just that, uh it’s, uh, it’s so dumb, really. Uh. [ CHUCKLES ] Uh, you know how my grandmother’s she’s getting rid of a lot of stuff. Well, she just thought that, um –
It’s, uh It’s, um It’s, uh It’s nothing, really. 
She’ll be so happy to hear that. It’s really more from her than it is from me.
Eat.
No, no, really, I’m good. Everything I want is right here.
Well, that’s because you assume that she wanted to marry me, and it wasn’t just a pit stop. A weigh station. A layover on her way to her final destination.
Yes.
I’m confused. You want the file Internal Affairs has on Garvey, the one they said you couldn’t have?
To steal their file, which has worthless information.
Wait. Aren’t you supposed to be on your way to Paris? I mean, didn’t Mr. Reddington give us a case that’s going to get us to Garvey?
Okay, that is a terrible idea.
Yes, it’s a government vehicle. They’re geo-tagged, but–
Yes, but he could miss the signal. He could be texting and driving.
How can you be so sure?
Oh! [ TIRES SCREECH ] [ A car hits Aram, knocking him to the ground ] [ THUMPS ]
[ GROANING ]
I-I’m not sure.
Assuming I’m not dead and he has his laptop in his car and he’s uploaded the file we’re looking for onto it – which, by the way, seemed like way too many “ands” to risk one’s life over – If he does all these things. And I am not dead.
Because you’re so sure this man is a rule follower. This man you’ve met – I don’t know – all of one time–
Less than a minute.
[ GROANING LOUDLY ] Ohh, ohh, ohh.
I programmed the flash drive to bypass any password requirements, run a search, and download any results that ping for Ian Garvey.
[ Stalling ] No, no, no, no, no, no. Just, uh, can you, um – pray with me?
Mm-hmm.
Ah.
[ Stalling ] Okay. Pray to, um, I don’t know, to, uh – to give thanks that I’m fine and that, um, you weren’t texting.
Who knew?
Oh. Yeah. Okay. I feel better.
Internal Affairs audited Garvey’s bank accounts, ran backgrounds on friends and family, had a revolving tail for weeks
We assumed this file would give us a lead. We took this incredible risk to get it. Well, I did, anyway, because we assumed. And when you assume something amazing is going to happen and it doesn’t, it sucks.
Well, there’s nothing amazing about sucking. I know.
Liz, I already looked at the surveillance logs.
Pete’s Tavern. So? Maybe he likes their hot wings.
They already had him under surveillance, and all he did was eat lunch.
Yeah. Delicious.
It wasn’t bad. It was terrible. [ CHUCKLES ] But it’s my fault for taking it.
I doubt it.
Why? So she can say no?
You said, if I gave her the engagement ring and she doesn’t think it’s a marriage proposal, then she doesn’t want to marry me.
Socially. Professionally, you’re kind of a savant.
IA did more than assume Garvey came here for the wings. They vetted all the employees, found nothing.
That makes sense, but the file says he was always alone.
Okay, so I reran the background checks, and I was right.
Everyone who works here is clean no criminal record, barely even a speeding ticket.
How can you tell?
So?
Okay, so if everyone who works here is clean and he’s not here to meet anyone and he’s not sending any kind of signal that we can detect, maybe he does just like the wings.
And now he’s leaving.
Okay. Okay, that looks like Lillian May Roth. 35, worked here for two years.  Before that, she lived in Virginia. Never married, no kids. Nothing.
Garvey’s married. You think he’s having an affair?
Why? He was right.
And you would’ve if you had wanted to marry me.
No. Agent Keen did.
She was right, too. If you’d wanted to marry me, you would’ve assumed it was an engagement ring.
Should I assume you don’t because you didn’t?
I’m glad.
Hey. Uh, you got to come to Mr Cooper’s office.
There’s something you need to hear.
Um- Uh, here, uh- Here’s your house keys. I figured I should- You know, since we’re not, um-
Oh. No, you don’t have to do that. I can I can pick them up whenever or–
Just happened two minutes ago.
Okay, so, I cued it up to the end. You can listen to the whole thing later, but this part– We got to do something about it, like, now. Here we go.
Polar one, we’re getting a bit of interference. Can you reposition 10 degrees north?
Guys. Mr Reddington is gonna be completely surrounded.
Guys. I got something. ⋘⋙ All right, so, this this is Garvey’s sedan going under this freeway overpass. And this is what came out.
Nope.
Actually, it kind of did. Into the back of that trailer. [ He hones in on a face in the cab of the truck pulling the trailer ] Courtesy of a Mr. Raleigh Sinclair.
Hello? Agent Mojtabai.
Mr Reddington. Is everything okay?
But if she hung up on you, she probably doesn’t want to talk to you or have me help you find her.
Wait, I thought you had Garvey.
Okay. She went to meet someone.
I don’t know, but this woman – the person she went to see – Liz planted a listening device on her, and if that device is within range and transmitting, I may be able to track it.
Okay. Uh- Hope I didn’t make a huge mistake, but I just hung up with Mr Reddington.
He lost Garvey, and he can’t reach Agent Keen. He thinks she may be in danger, and so he asked me to help locate her. Now, I went ahead and pinged the transmitter on her listening device before the signal cut out.
So he says.
Yes, but before the signal dropped, it was broadcasting from a bar on East Fayette Street in Baltimore Pete’s Tavern. It’s the same place where Agent Keen was meeting–
And where Reddington is headed now.
She’s not answering.
A young girl appears out of nowhere, completely untouched by modern medicine. Not only is there no evidence of vaccinations, she has zero trace of the toxins we encounter on a daily basis.
Okay, so, I think I have a lead. There was another one found 46 miles from where our Jane Doe turned up.
2003 – maintenance workers from RBX Rail discovered a deranged man walking on a
Like our girl, he had no modern dental work, and his blood work exhibited the same rare biological pathogens.
Between ’05 and ’08, he was a ward of the state, committed to the Heinritz Psychiatric Center in Concord. He was under the care of a Dr Francis Woerner, who is an expert in something called “Anomalistic psychology,” which is the study of extraordinary behavior and experience, including those which are often labeled “paranormal.” 
Overcome. Taken. She’s vanished. I’ve run, uh, hospital feeds, uh, CCTV.
Uh, there’s no plates, no clean shot of the V.I.N. The laundry service and phone number are fakes.
Found on the side of the road a quarter mile from the hospital.
Um, okay. I pulled one image of the abductor, but I can’t find any matches in the system.
I cannot believe this is happening.
Stop staying that, Liz. Everything is not gonna be okay. Samar was taken by a professional, and we do not have a single credible lead on how to find her!
“The Age of Contagion” is a little-known paperback written by Nicholas T Moore in 1971. It tells the story of a group who survive a plague that nearly wipes out civilization. They then retreat to the forest to hide from the infected, or the Ollo.
New Haven, the rhyolite, the warnings about leaving camp.
If these people are actually isolationists like the characters in the book, then they think that we are infected. And according to the book, once you’re infected, the only way you can be purified is by burning in some giant, furnace-like fire.
And Samar.
Sir. Sir, I think I found something. Okay, so Jane Doe was found along a remote stretch of road in New Hampshire. WP Frost was found 46 miles to the south.
Yes, which is important because Moore’s book refers to something that he calls an Invocation Ceremony. It’s like a baptism. It takes place in a waterfall. Now, out of 85 waterfalls in New Hampshire, 25 are in Grafton County, and one, Stinson Brook Falls, is located just two miles from where Jane Doe was found.
No, but this does. [ He lays out a map ] Okay, tax records deeding 580 acres of wooded land to a non-profit entity the same year that Moore vanished.
Thank you, sir.
Not saying it’s gonna be okay.
Did you find her?
So, you haven’t found her?
If they haven’t found her, then she’s gotta be inside with them.
Or she’s not inside, and then she’s in even more danger, but someone in there knows for sure. We have to go in.
We cannot wait for a negotiator. We have to do something now.
They think that we are the enemy, that we are infected with some kind of virus. They are not gonna just let us walk in.
I’m unarmed. My name is Agent Aram Mojtabai. I’m with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There was an FBI way before 1957, so you you know what that is, right?
Oh, boy. Okay. Yeah, see, uh, you think that. Uh. I-I-I know you were taught to believe that, but, uh, I’m here, and, you know, we’re we’re here, and we are not infected. We are not the Ollo.
The things that you’ve been told, the story about Carl Davies and his experiments, how he was accidentally stuck by a needle which triggered a plague – it’s- it’s all fiction.
What I’m saying is that it is literally fiction. This book- This book that I’m holding – It’s called “The Age of Contagion,” and it was written in 1971 by an unemployed, aspiring novelist from Tamworth, New Hampshire. And his name his name was Nicholas T Moore.
He doesn’t want you to know the truth. He doesn’t want anybody born here to know that he has been lying to you. He never even really existed. He’s, um- He’s just a character who worked at some made-up company called–
[ Solemnly ] You’re him. Nicholas T Moore. You tell them. You thought civilization was doomed, so you created one of your own, based on your book.
I can’t do that, not without Agent Navabi, the one inside. You let her go.
Is she hurt? Just- Could- Could you- Could you just tell me if she’s okay?
Okay, okay! Just – read it. Read it. Please. You will understand everything if you just just read it.
Hey. Hey, where is she, the agent, Samar Navabi?
You know exactly who I’m talking about, and you’re gonna tell me where she is. Come on! Answer me! Where is she? Where?!
[ Calling back to Moore ] What do you mean, “She’s gone”? [ To Ressler ] He knows something! 
Not without Agent Navabi, the one inside. You let her go.
An hour? Agent Navabi’s already been gone for an entire day.
While we wait for Mr. Reddington’s interrogator? We do not have time. That man in our interrogation room – he knows something, and we need to get him to talk [ INHALES DEEPLY ] like, now.
Sir. Let me talk to him. L-Let me see if I can get him to budge.
I don’t know, but, please, just give me two minutes with the man behind Samar’s abduction. That’s all I ask.
Mr Moore. I don’t know if you remember me. My name is Agent Aram Mojtabai.
What?
Yes.
Not even slightly. Agent Navabi – I need you to tell me what you know about the man who took her.
Steven who? What- What is his last name?
Do you know where he is now?
He already has.
Uh, with all due respect, sir, all that matters now is that I did. Uh, turns out Moore, uh, goes through a third party to make contact – a guy by the name of Hannelore.
It’s the scientific discipline devoted to the study of death and decay.
And this guy has Samar.
 I got it for him. [ SIGHS ] That’s how I got him to talk, sir. He said he’d help us find Samar if I stole it for him, and so, I did. And I’ll accept whatever punishment you think is appropriate, but it got us a name and now a location where Samar may be.
Not only that, but I found a cellphone registered under one of Devlin’s known aliases registered to that same farm.
Now, the HLR – that’s the Home Location Register – is updated every time a phone’s SIM is transferred into another location area, and according to the HLR, that phone was in Grafton County two days ago.
Devlin must be in the middle of nowhere because he’s only pinging off of one tower.
Not off one tower. They could be anywhere within a 45-mile radius.
Yeah, if she isn’t already dead.
[ Over phone ] Lawrence Devlin, this is Special Agent Aram Mojtabai of the FBI. We know you have Agent Navabi.
We know where you live, and we will find you, and when we do, Samar Agent Navabi better be alive.
You may not be aware of this, but taking the life of a federal officer is a capital crime, punishable by death. So if she’s- If you kill her – we will kill you. [ CLICKS ] 
Stop! Stop! Stop! I said, stop. Stop!
Samar, where is she? Agent Navabi.
Lawrence Devlin, where’d he take her? Where did he take her? 
[ Agitated ] Okay, okay, uh, Mr Hull, I-I need to be very clear with you. The FBI is, uh, going to find Lawrence Devlin, and when they do, they’re gonna prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law, and when that happens, you will be an accessory. Now, whatever you know, however you can help, will be taken into consideration when charges are brought against you. Which will happen.
What is it?
What? What body? What do you mean, “a body”?
Oh, God. I think I have something.
No, no! Samar, no. No.
[ COUGHING ]
Hello?
Samar?! Oh, my God, are you okay?
An accident? Are- Are- Are you hurt? Where are you?
Water, okay. What- What- What water? Listen, um, I think I think we’re close. Just tell me where you are. Samar? Come on, Samar, talk to me. Lawrence Devlin, the man who took you.
A bear? As in – a bear? Okay, listen, now, the water, is it a lake or a river?
It’s a lake or a river?
That’s- I- [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] Samar. Listen to me. All that matters is getting your home safely. So, please, just tell me where you are. [ VOICE BREAKING ] Tell me where you are, Samar. Come on. Come on, Samar! Samar, come on! 
There was an accident and water. The van was in water.
Yeah, but we don’t have to look for all of it. When I ran a search for Devlin’s cell signal before, it only pinged one tower in the region uh, here, outside Kingwood. That limits us to four or five square miles of river. She said there was a bear.
Come on! Where are you?!
Guys! Guys, I-I found it! I think I see the van.
I don’t know. Some- Um, I-I turned north off Kannan, less than a quarter mile– Samar. Samar!
[ GASPING ] Okay.
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on.
[ GASPS ] 
Come on! [ GASPING ] 
[ GASPS ]
Come on. Come on, Samar. Come on.
[ Desperately ] Come on. Come on! 
[ Upbeat, to Samar ] So, I, uh, did a little research. I know, I know. Pathetic, right? And yet hang on maybe, uh, maybe not so pathetic. Okay. So, I came across this study from 2014 that, uh, showed how playing familiar music to people in, uh, in minimally conscious states enhanced recovery. They found that certain audio cues improved cerebral plasticity and, um and helped them recover. So, uh, since, at the moment, you can’t get to your favorite playlist, I thought that I would bring your favorite playlist to you.
Okay, so, uh, uh, this one wasn’t, uh, on your playlist, or mine. But I’m kind of hoping that someday [ KEYS CLACKING ] it will be.
Samar. I’ve been in love with you since the first moment I saw you.
Every day since then has- has been my best day because I have spent them with you.
I want to spend all my days with you. 
So – 
[ EXHALES DEEPLY ] Here we go. [ CHUCKLES ] 
Samar Navabi – at long last – 
Will you marry me?
She’s shivering.
I know. I read up on TTM, how you circulate cold saline through her femoral artery, but her core body temperate was only 91 degrees.
Right. By decreasing the brain’s demand for oxygen, you reduce neurotransmitter production like glutamate.
I read the page and the footnotes. 91 degrees was an AHA guideline in 2010, but in 2015, the journal Resuscitation concluded that 97 degrees was more effective.
I’m her fiancé. Granted, I proposed while she was unconscious.
No, but–
[ On phone ] First of all, I want to thank you.
No. No, no, no. Not at all. You distracted me. Right now, that is exactly what I need – the doctors, too. It keeps me from telling them what to do.
Only when I think what they’re doing is wrong, so, like, all the time. Except now. Right now, I’m thinking about Ravi Desai.
Are you kidding me? I’ve been a huge fan ever since he won the I-EEE Robotics and Automation Award as a PhD student at Brown. I follow him on Instagram, Twitter.
Well, the backup files indicate that it’s some kind of exoskeleton, a manned robot designed to help people go into hazardous areas.
Well, maybe, but the idea is all he’d be selling. Whoever buys these drives will not be able to build one.
Well, the files are all snippets of ideas and partial equations. I mean, Desai could build a robot from them, but no one else could, not without him to explain what they mean.
Oh, well, that shouldn’t be hard. He’s at a matinee with his kids.
Like I said, I follow him on Instagram, and he just posted a picture with them on his way to a show at the Kittredge Theater.
The same. Uh, at least she was when her doctors kicked me out. Agent Keen, are you all right?
I know, which is, uh- why I’m here. I meant it – work is a distraction, so, please, say you have some for me.
I think I know who hired Ross to abduct Ravi Desai and where and when Ross will be handing him over.
And the number. All right, the message was sent to a cell with an international number.
So – after Ravi Desai got his PhD, two robotics companies wanted to hire him. One was Veritable, the other AXG Robotics.
And Homeland says two of their execs landed in Dulles this morning.
It doesn’t, but the message does. “AM” isn’t a time it’s a place. A neighborhood in D.C., Adams Morgan. And in Adams Morgan is the old Winchester Pharmaceutical Plant.
Uh, yes. The Metro Suites downtown. Why?
Hang on, hang on. I think I can override the CCTV’s power if it’s still active.
Okay, we are officially in full lockdown.
I’m searching our security feeds now, and there’s no sign of anyone in corridors L2, three, or five.
All right, Schay, Schay. Come on. Okay, Schay. Charlie, interim security. His badge was swiped two minutes ago at door 32C.
83-724. That’s the code. 83-724. That’s the code.
Look, I’m sorry. He was going to shoot her.
I’m up on the phone. As soon as I get a hard trace, I’ll call it in. [ BEEPS ]
 I’ve got the pay phone tapped, not the burner. I have no way to access that line.
Okay, pulling CCTV feeds now.
What do you mean “letting”?
All right, I’m pulling up additional CCTV feeds now with a view on the rear entrance of the lumberyard.
Okay, I’ve got him. They’re loading him into a white late-model van.
Okay, the target van is headed south on Central.
Agent Ressler, hang on a second. We’ve got a situation. I’ve got another van.
Actually, I’ve got two more vans and two more unsubs being loaded now and on the move. Make that north on Central and south on Central.
Yeah. I’m already on it. Okay, Team Bravo, your van is moving west on Bryant. [ ENGINE REVS ] Okay, Charlie, you can intercept three blocks north on Gerard. [ ENGINE REVS ]
Okay, Bravo and Charlie have intercepted two vans, and you are right behind the third.
Yeah?
Which one? We’ve got all three.
You’re saying this is all a distraction?
By my count, the search area has over 500 businesses, 64 blocks. Even with MPD assisting, it’s got to be– Ugh! It’s got to be at least one minute per block. We’re never gonna find them.
How can you be so sure?
I feel the same way about Samar, too.
[ Typing ] Okay, Delaware plate “8LV235.” Running it now.
Oh, my God. I, uh, I have to go. I-I have to go.
I didn’t know if– And when you didn’t wake up, I thought, um– 
I don’t know what I thought.
What?
“Yes,” what?
I’m sorry. Changing their faces?
[ On phone ] All right. I am not saying I’m amazing. But sometimes I am distinctly above average.
The good doctor texted an employee saying that he was in France.
And why would I do that?
I said that’s what he said. But when I pulled the records from the cell carrier and this is the distinctly above-average part I found that his text wasn’t sent from France. It was sent from right here in D.C.
Sending it to you right now. Mr. Cooper’s working on getting a warrant.
I didn’t. Mr. Reddington did. He sent me the employee’s cell. Which, um, I guess, if you want to be technical about it, means he’s the amazing one.
All right. The Corsican is a gun for hire. But not by just anyone. He has a very particular clientele. The Tamil Tigers. The Kosovo Liberation Army. He’s a nationalist who works on behalf of groups fighting against globalism.
Not yet.
Which means people are gonna die.
Well, we’ve scoured CCTV feeds, but he was obviously avoiding the cameras. Nothing clearly shows his face.
Correct, but we do know that he purchased a ticket under the name Dino DiPasquale and was all set to board Premium Sky flight number 206 to JFK. Now, the alias is burned, but –
Okay, I think we have a problem.
Mr Cooper spoke to the ambassador at the Turkish Embassy, who confirmed that Albrecht was headed to a meeting at – Get this, The United Nations.
All right, U.N. Security Police says Albrecht’s badge was swiped six minutes ago at the first basement level, entrance C2.
Okay, uh, all right, I have the feeds up now.
Hello.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, I think I got him.
All right, turn left. No, right. No, no, no, your right. He can’t be more than 20 yards ahead of you, moving west.
Okay, I can’t tell.  
Uh Come on. Where’d you go? All right, I, I lost him on the feed.
I do not have a visual.
Okay. I just picked him up again. You’re close.
Not yet, but I’ve got NYPD analyzing footage of the area as we speak.
[ On phone ] He’s been arrested.
Great? Why would you say that?
I know, but, look. I know theoretically that I should be happy that someone who’s done what he’s done has finally been caught, but I’m not. I’m sad.
Moreau?
No. We haven’t found Moreau. We’re still working on that.
Mr. Reddington. Mr. Reddington is the one that’s been arrested.
Less than an hour ago, he was, uh, buying a pretzel. 30 years on the run, and a beat cop picks him up at a pretzel cart.
NYPD is holding him at the 27th.
He’s in with Panabaker.
No one wants that.
Thinking what?
That’s crazy. None of us would betray Mr. Reddington like that.
His name is Spalding Stark. This guy is, like, a total icon in the biohacking community.
Oh, yeah. I’ve been reading about this guy for years. I saw a live stream in 2009 where he injected himself with a homemade malaria vaccine.
To prove that it was safe. The FDA wouldn’t authorize human trials without a ton of red tape. So – get this – the plan was to inject himself with the vaccine, then let an infected Anopheles mosquito bite him – live.
No. He suffered a catastrophic hyper-immune response. Paralyzed half his face along with his left arm and leg.
Yeah. He put his body on the line to to improve the human condition.
Meaning you don’t?
Uh, just a friend. We trade ideas sometimes online. Oh, um don’t stare at his head. He hates that.
Oh, no way. Um, this is, uh, Samar. Uh, Agent Navabi.
So, what are you guys working on?
Sweet. Um, actually, uh– we gotta run. I, uh I just came by to, uh, see if you had anything for us on that broken injector gun. You got that photo I sent, right?
Who?
Guys, guys. I went through Kirby’s files. Everything he told us is true.
It all started with his own injuries. That malaria vaccine he developed? It damaged his motor cortex, which is why he started studying all this stuff in the first place. And he documented everything – how he mapped out the multi-allelic defects, how he developed a viral payload designed to produce hybrid cells with corrected genomes.
He reversed it, no question.
I had the same question, so I went down to the forensics lab and got a copy of  the preliminary tox report. You won’t believe what they found.
All right, that’s him – Dr. Ethan Webb, and according to his profile, he’s a synthetic biologist and a molecular virologist. And guess where he used to work.
Until about two years ago when he was fired and left the company in disgrace.
Stealing proprietary data. They suspected he was working on a cure on his own. That must be when he partnered up with Stark.
Don’t tell me he’s done this before.
Hey. Everything cool? 
Let’s get out of here. I am starving.
They’re so cute. They sort of remind me of this couple that used to babysit me in Delaware, the Gambalas. Uh, Rita- Rita. She used to make these oatmeal cookies that, um I’m sorry. [ Trailing off ] That’s, uh– That’s irrelevant.
[ Over comms ] Okay, got it. Got a license-plate number for me or any other details?
Okay. Give me a little time.
No, not the woman. The kid with the red backpack from earlier this morning – Tom Hardekopf.
Yeah, except he’s not just an MIT grad working at a tech firm. Turns out, he also has a TS-SCI-level clearance with the U.S. government.
Yeah, with the NSA.
They already have one.
Well, I went to their website and noticed they have a great deal on this – 4K ultra, super slim, 65-inch with – wait for it – a built-in camera to video-chat with friends via Wi-Fi.
Well, there’s no audio, but 10 minutes ago, we saw this.
Meaning, we have to buy it first.
All right, Agent Navabi’s transmitter is up. She’s approaching now.
What are you worried about?
[ To Quayle ] She doesn’t have any.
Divided loyalties.
We don’t have to see. We already know. 
It looks like– It looks like they moved to a back room.
Okay, guys, I think we have a problem. Agent Navabi’s transponder just started moving.
Okay, guys, there must be a secondary exit because I have her moving north on Martin Luther King Boulevard.
Okay, she just turned east on Bentonhurst. Approaching Colfax now.
Okay, the vector’s currently showing a location at Park Street. All right, Agent Ressler, do you have eyes on that vehicle?
All right, good DMV record shows a ’92 Buick Estate Wagon registered to their business.
Agent Keen, building security is sending me their feeds now, and it looks like you are in a civilian area. Also, there is a van moving your way from two stories above.
Agent Keen. Agent Keen! Watch out!
“Quetzals.” That is the national bird of Guatemala and, weirdly, one of its monetary units.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no. If you put the Q and the S on the triple word score, it’s worth over 300 points.
Right. Work.
As of the reading of his father’s will, Tim Peterson is the 511th-richest man in America and, I’m fairly confident, the only billionaire working in a bowling alley and living in a trailer park. Ressler: Looks like that apple fell a few, uh, light-years from the tree.
Oh, that’s putting it mildly. His credit score is 580, he’s $62,000 in debt, and he has got a criminal record.
Well, let’s say he did know. How does a kid living in a trailer park outside Arlington connect in any way to Mr. Reddington?
Hey. Guys. Peterson’s story checks out. He was given up by his birth mother, raised in foster care, and has an alibi for the night Van Ness died. Cameras at the bowling alley show show him working that night.
Driver’s license and Social Security number registered to Deidre Mori are less than 12 months old.
[ On comms ] Corner of Trenton and Willoughby. I can’t get any more specific than that, but she’s there.
Hey. How was Alter Ego?
Great. I’ll print them out. And, by the way, I downloaded Word Splurge.
So we can play against each other.
Okay. If you’re worried about crushing me – and my rather minuscule ego–
–be warned I’m highly competitive at word games.
And– Uh, what?
But you do play.
Why?
Hiding the truth that your marriage is fake? I don’t know how long that can last. In a relationship, the truth always comes out.
Wait. What? I love weddings. Wait. If you need a plus-one, I’m totally down to go.
I highly doubt it, because they’re fake, too.
Terminally ill patients. Cops think it was euthanasia.
So, I’ve been thinking about The Angel of Death and trying to figure out why a digital nomad who never stops moving would stop in one place for nearly three months. The answer? His kidney.
Not the treatments, the cure.
I pulled the rolls of every kidney transplant recipient in Philadelphia in 2010. And after removing the patients [ KEYS CLACKING ] that were the wrong age, sex, or race, I was able to narrow it down to a list of 14 men, one of which is this guy.
He’s he right age, and before 2010, – he was non-existent.
I’m telling you I think this is our guy.
I did, and it appears he’s in D.C. His last purchase was for a hotel room – near 4th and E Street. [ KEYS CLACKING ] And that – that was under an hour ago.
The Chione founder? That guy is like a gazillionaire.
I’m sorry, I think I’m confused. What is a-a-a deceased witness in a hit-and-run case have to do with The Angel of Death killer?
Ew.
We’re all in, if that’s what you’re asking.
Not yet, but according to a recent SEC filing, Lockemy was lobbying Congress and the FDA for approval.
Wait. The clean air guy?
What better way to do that than at a power lunch on K Street?
Why would someone who kills people because he hates the pesticides they make kill someone who hates pesticides?
They had lunch here a week ago.
What kind of incident?
He may be able to I.D. the killer.
Me llamo Aram. Mucho gusto.  [ CHUCKLES ] Uh, yeah, that’s that’s the extent of my Spanish. It was a first period in high school and I’ve never really been much of a morning person. Right. Okay, uh, here’s the thing. [ To Tony ] My parents were refugees.
Agent Navabi was a-a political refugee herself. Tell him that we both believe in amnesty. And that we’ll go as soon as he tells us what he knows.
Muchas gracias.
Well, I wanted him to feel comfortable. I didn’t think trying to convince him that you’re actually a lovable Zionist was the way to do it.
You remember him?
Oh, this is disturbing.
Beetle larva. All of which has probably been genetically modified.
Oh, a thimbleful, if that.
Yeah, it does. Again and again and again.
We had it all wrong about Lockemy and Kendel being on opposite sides. It turns out they both wanted to legalize Hexapene.
Paid his organization $3 million to do an independent analysis.
We also found a copy of a press release that Kendel’s organization was scheduled to release today in support of Hexapene.
The legislation that Congress is considering to legalize Hexapene, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is holding a hearing on it today, and the Blacklister had the date circled in his calendar.
Not where we found him, it isn’t.
Paramedics are on their way.
Oh, hey. You guys got here early. Bagels. Happy Monday. Oh, my gosh. I gotta tell you a funny story. I had the craziest weekend. You are not gonna believe this. Um, hang on. Are these gluten-free? 
What do you mean?
Okay, so, the device Agents Keen and Ressler identified was some kind of splitter. It duplicated the signal from Shah’s phone, sending one signal to the number Shah dialed and another to a different location.
Now, I couldn’t trace the calls, but we did find similar devices. [ KEYS CLACKING ] And get this – They were all monitoring landlines and cell towers operated by the VeraCom Phone Company.
Three joined the company after the first reported incident, one left the country to do missionary work in 2013, and another died of a heart attack just eight months ago.
The name’s an alias. Taxes filed under a stolen Social. Engineering degrees also forged.
Hey. He uses a manual typewriter.
Our guy. The listener. Are you sitting in the dark?
Oh. I didn’t know you got migraines.
You okay?
Right, um – anyway, have you ever used a manual typewriter? Yeah, it’s impossible. Just to make a mark, you have to slam on each key. [ Grins broadly ]
All right, by slamming on each key, you leave a mark on the paper and the ribbon. And after the ribbon is hit, it spools. So if you unspool it, you can see the last thing Minister D typed.
The next target is Peter DeReamer, who cheated on his wife with a Mikela Pariente.
Not the affair. The insurance. $2 million in his wife’s name, which paid out when they killed her. Yesterday, Bailey recorded this.
The building manager at Mikela’s apartment saw him arrive 20 minutes ago.
Elijah Bailey is an alias. We matched his DNA to a Jordan Loving, a retired corporal in the Army Corps of Engineers. Now, he disappeared from a hospital four days after he made the recording that Mr. Reddington says will clear his name.
I think it’s too late for that.
The court needed the tape copied to a flash drive, – but this is the original.
It’s gonna be fine. Everything’s gonna be fine.
Illegal activity accounts for half of all Bitcoin transactions. 36 million annual transactions with a value of approximately $72 billion.
It’s an abbreviation for “Remote Access Trojans” malware that allows the user to lock companies out of their own servers. The hacker then demands a ransom and unlocks the server once it’s paid.
Did you check the street?
It’s gonna be awesome.
Oh, you, uh you must be Jamie.
Called a a Faraday cage. I’m so sorry we haven’t met. I’m Agent Mojtabai. You can, uh- you can call me Aram. This is a super cool room.
Right, yeah. Sorry about that. I promise I’ll help fix everything up when we’re done.
Well, it’s sort of like a force field, uh, created by a man named Michael Faraday.
He was, uh, kind of. A, uh– a scientific superhero.
Actually, uh, Banshee doesn’t really have a force field–
Touché.
In here, it will. That’s why we’re building it. So you’ll be safe.
Sure. If, uh, your dad’s all right with it.
Okay. Well, here grab yourself a handful of zip ties and, uh, let’s get to work.
Okay, cross your fingers and toes.
Okay.
We’re up.
How often do you push software updates to your monitoring devices?
That’s how he got in. I mean, think about it. The devices have built-in access authority. Why not use the home monitor as a proxy for the malware program? – It’s perfect.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
No, no. You- You can’t do that.
Okay, this is a, uh, this is a really bad idea.
Where are you going? This was not part of our plan. We agreed to–
This guy he won’t just let you walk away.
[ On phone to Post Office ] They’re taking Pierson’s daughter to the hospital. She’s gonna be okay.
Pierson has 24 hours to pay the ransom or the RAT says he’ll kill 1,000 of them.
A pacemaker is a mini defibrillator. If the heart stops, it can deliver a jolt of electricity to restart it.
It was, until the RAT took control over the system.  Now he can recalibrate the amount of electricity that gets delivered, turning a safe jolt into a lethal one.
There’s no sign of him or his computer.
Nothing. Only the docking station, which I assume he uses for his laptop.
Of course. That is genius. The serial number IDs the computer and the company that made it.
Which gives us an IP address as soon as the computer’s turned on. I found you. The, uh the serial number, not the RAT.
Done and done. When he turns it on, – it should ping me a location.
Whoever has the computer, we’ll get a trace as soon as they turn it on.
Okay, that’s it. The computer it is on.
Uh, the diagnostics program is booting up. Come on. Come on! Come on.
Okay, that’s it. I got it. The IP address belongs to the First Bank of Maryland, 399 North Avenue. And, hang on – I know who has it.
I used the diagnostics program to grab a screenshot from the webcam.
Keep your hands where we can see them!
Do what she says, sir. Stop! Please stop!
Gun!!
He was gonna shoot her.
He had his gun out.
Come on.
Okay.
Um, is he, uh is he gonna make it?
He had the computer, so he obviously knows the password. I need that password.
Oh, boy. Someone get Pierson on the phone, please.
Mr. Pierson, this is Aram Mojtabai. I need you to, uh, give me just a minute.
Okay, all right, I got it. Mr. Pierson, I’m gonna give you an authentication code that you need to type into the ransomware prompt. You cannot get this wrong or transpose a digit, or we could get locked out or trip a bypass–
Okay. 7S–
8#0
D7D
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, uh, uh, just to double-check, Agent Ressler, is, uh, is that the letter “O” or or a zero?
Okay, go. Now. Hit “enter” now.
You’re welcome. Oh, and, uh I would do a fresh install of all the affected pacemakers even though the malware is disabled. And, uh, please tell Jamie I’d totally come help redecorate her room if she wants.
Ouch! Ow! – 
Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, fine, fine, fine. All- All good.
Um. Why do they always execute people at 12:01? – It’s so ghoulish.
Appeals? –
So it’s not ghoulish. It’s, uh, calculated. That’s worse.
To be honest? Uh, no. I’m not.
Hey, uh I, uh I spilled, uh, coffee this morning. Uh, I was, um, watching the news about Mr. Reddington and, um, uh, point being, I spilled on your phone.
Yeah, I know. Because, uh, while I was cleaning it, you got a text. About seeing a speech pathologist.
Uh, the text was from the National Aphasia Association. Uh, it said NAA, but, uh, then I looked it up.
And then I looked up “aphasia.” Samar, I am confused and worried, and- and I’m a little annoyed that you didn’t say anything. So, no, I don’t think we can talk about this later. I think it’s been long enough.
What damage? The migraines?
Words. Like “appeals.”
But you’re seeing a therapist.
W-What can I do? Uh, tell me. Tell me what to do, I’ll do it.
What? She shouldn’t be alone.
We have a plan. Do you?
Well, ours is not much of a plan, but it’s something, and it is not beside the point since it appears Mr. Reddington’s life depends on–
Besides, it’s not like we have to rob a bank. We just have to rob a name from a bank, and that is an important distinction. At least it should be, even though it’s, uh, still illegal.
[ Through the cockpit door ] Edward! Wheels up in five. Always wanted to do that.
A brief peek at their system looks like they’re running a wickedly advanced Least Privilege program with access controls and redundant audit trails.
It’s un-hackable. I mean, even senior level employees they only have access to selected fragments of the bank’s computer system.
Okay, so, who’s the bank president?
Well, uh, I’d have to see it to know.
If I saw it, assuming we were able to get it and none of us were arrested in the process, uh, I could I could probably tell in a minute or two.
If none of us got arrested.
Okay, wait, sorry. Uh, Agent Ressler’s – running point on overwatch?
No, it’s just, uh, I thought it might make more sense to have Samar in my ear. You know, we have a real shorthand.
I just thought you might be more comfortable working with me.
No. [ CHUCKLING ] Sorry, it’s cool. Uh, you take the overwatch. So, um – how do we plan on getting me that fob, again? 
[ Over comms ] I warn you, this could take a while. There are layers of encryption and access controls. [ LAPTOP BEEPING ] Whoa, this is more complicated than I thought.
What? Already?! – How is that even possible?
Okay, um, just h-hold on a second. I’m in. I just need time to create the duplicate. Like, two more minutes.
Just, almost there almost –
Okay, here we go. Okay. All right, I got it! –
Oh, no.
Uh nothing. Everything’s fine.
We’re good. I’m coming.
Ooh! [ SIGHS ] Don’t ask.
I’m searching account holders now. [ KEYS CLACKING ] – Okay, wait, wait. Here. [ LAPTOP BEEPS ] Here we go.
How is a foreign intelligence officer from Germany supposed to help save Mr.
Hey, um, Ressler told me how you took down Kruger. That shot.
He said it was an amazing shot.
Listen – trying to take you out of the field in Luxembourg was wrong. Uh, you’re obviously more than up for the job, and I should’ve given you the benefit of any doubt. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] I’m sorry I didn’t.
I’ve had a lot of practice.
Are you looking for schematics?
Okay, understood. I’m on it.
Copy that. 8323 14th Street Northwest. I have a DC PD escort en route. Awaiting instructions from BND and DSS. [ Diplomatic Security Service ]
[ On phone ] Okay, I just got word from the Bomb Squad. Preliminary sweep says they found no explosive devices on site.
And another thing, and I know this is so not the time, but, uh I was grabbing some, uh, UN reports for Agent Ressler from your office. And while I was there, uh, I noticed a few discarded incident reports in the trash.
After what you did in the field, I thought I’d overreacted, but these mistakes, they are, um what you were having trouble with is – is basic. I had no idea how much damage has been done.
I can’t imagine what it must have been like being there.
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait. Mr. Reddington’s alive?
I’m pretty sure he already knows.
Hey. Um — You’re incredible.
No, Your brain it is incredible, the way it’s been able to compensate.
Actually, we haven’t, not– Not this. These, uh these incident reports.
The cross-outs, the misspellings uh, organizing thoughts, expressing yourself. You know, I know you had reached out to a speech pathologist, but I had I had no idea how rapid the decline has been.
We have to tell Mr. Cooper.
The Corsican. Uh, Bastien Moreau?
As payment for intel and his credentials so that Moreau could get into Ava Ziegler’s hotel room.
Did you know all this from the start?
Copy. Here.
Have you seen Samar?
Neither would I, but without saying anything?
Hey. I heard about what happened. How Miles died in your arms. I-I’m so sorry.
Yeah, I didn’t know you smoked.
Did you hear? Uh, Moreau is dead. Mr. Reddington’s immunity agreement is being restored.
What?
I’m sure you did.
Which you do.
Tell me.
You are not responsible–
–Moreau is. He shot him.
Christopher Miles is not dead because of you.
Good. That’s good. I am sure he’ll understand.
Right? See? That’s right. Listen. Everything’s gonna work out, okay? It’s gonna be just fine. It’s gonna be fine.
Thank God it’s over.
We, uh– We have no leads on his killer.
Where are you going?
Was he talking about me?
Right. Of course. Do you want me to come with you?
Hey, it’s, um it’s the right thing to do.
I’m glad you resigned. That gives us the time to get you the treatment that you need.
Let’s just stick to one major life decision at a time.
And we will. After you get better.
No.
Of course. That I can do.
Reportedly?
Does Mr. Reddington know him?
How’d it go?
They gave you a polygraph? Why?
That’s ridiculous. And insulting.
I can’t believe they think that you could be a traitor.
You know, we should tell Mr. Cooper, and he’ll strengthen them right out.
[ Angrily ] Why? Why is that so urgent that it cannot wait until you get help or convince Levi that you didn’t dump him to join Hamas? He does know that I’m, like, a quarter Jewish, right? 
The Library of Congress. They have more primary source material than any library in the world.
This is really happening.I mean, I know it is, but–  Whoa. You are tall.
That’s the first thing I ever said to you. When, uh, Mr. Cooper brought you into the war room. I was thinking, “Whoa. You are, like, super pretty.”
 We need to talk. And as my dad used to say, now is as bad a time as any, so– How many aliases do you have?
Well, then I better memorize them. That way, I can always find you, if, um– Wait. Oh, my God. That’s it. How to find Mr. Reddington.
Yes. Um- Uh, you stay here. I’ll- I’ll tell Mr. Cooper. And then, um, I’ll get us some coffees, and we’ll talk. You’re really tall.
Mr. Homan just made a sizable donation to the Marigny Foundation for the Arts.
He’s one of Mr. Reddington’s aliases.
Levi. What- What are you doing here?
I have no idea what you’re talking about. And I-I don’t really appreciate being followed.
Yeah, well, questioning her loyalty is a funny way of showing it.
What is that supposed to mean? Is that some kind of threat?
Sorry. Please go ahead.
Just– Hang on. There was an accident. She– Her brain was was deprived of oxygen.
Listen. This is very private. And she wants to keep this to herself. It’s something called vascular dementia. Will that be enough to satisfy your bosses?
I– [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] Um, I-I have, uh, absolutely no idea.
I’m, uh, not surprised.
Well, whatever you told him, it’s over. So – now we can talk. About you being pregnant.
­That’s what you’ve been trying to tell me, isn’t it?
So, my parents made this for me 30 years ago for the day I became a dad. Uh, all I, uh, remember are the fruit-flies and the, uh, cheesecloth. [ LAUGHS ] And the fancy crystal that my mom insists on using nine months from now when we pop the cork to celebrate unimaginable love.
You’re not?
Okay.
If you don’t think we should have kids, then we shouldn’t have them.
I’ll be saying the same thing.
You’re wrong about me.
When you said there’s nothing I want more than to have a child. I mean, that is– That is what I thought, what I had always imagined. Until I met you. And then you changed everything.
What we have – This is our story, and if our story doesn’t involve having kids, well, that’s okay.
I don’t need to wait nine months to celebrate unimaginable love. And I certainly don’t need fancy crystal.
We are never breaking up. Okay? Ever. And I don’t want any denial anger, bargaining or depression. 
Okay. Promise me this – that you’ll do everything humanly possible to try and get better.
It’s going to be okay.
Everything will be okay.
[ SINGSONG VOICE ] Rise and shine.
It has been a morning. Two small grease fires in the kitchen, one almost-disastrous juicing mishap. But, voilá. Breakfast in bed.
French toast, hash browns – all your favorites.
Well, I got the orange juice right, uh, fresh-squeezed. But, um, careful – might be a part of my finger in there.
I thought you’d want a full stomach before our trip.
The Lodge at Glenforest. Rural Pennsylvania. Three days, two nights. Our own cabin in the woods. Dinners in the main lodge, crackling fires. I look really, really good in flannel. What do you think?
I cleared it with Mr. Cooper. The team can manage. It’s not like the world’s gonna end.
It’s a few days. Eat up. I’ll pack.
Was thinking this was more of a romantic getaway, but, you know, if you feel naked without a gun, we can role-play.
How about we start some new habits?
Unless you want to role-play.
Meeting a stranger. No. Maid/butler secret rendezvous.
Yeah, you tried pretty hard, but lucky for you, I can’t take a hint. So, hitchhiker. Interrogation.
Teacher/pupil.
Okay.
But it’s the best I can do. You said the world needs me. Can’t go breaking a hip in a snowmobiling accident.
They only have service in the Big House.How great is that? The sound of silence.
Hello.
Yes.
That’s weird. I, uh I do have another. It’s a Visa. Can I- Can I give you the number?
Uh, no problem. I’ll, uh, be right there. Credit card’s not working. I need to bring them another.
I’ll be right back.
I got a call. There’s a problem with my card?
Uh, Sutton’s Cabin, by the creek.
That’s so weird.
Is, uh Is the spa still open today?
I will, uh, call the spa later. I’m a sucker for a good scalp massage.
Sorry. The, uh, cell service is terrible here.
The, um, Glenforest Lodge in the Allegheny Mountains. Why? What is, uh– What’s going on?
Samar.
Oh, my God. You’re bleeding.
Um, um, whoa. Uh, is she, um– Is she dead? Um, oh, uh, okay. Uh, I spoke to Mr. Cooper, and, uh, they are after you, the Ostark, uh, um, Umbrella Company or something.
You know them?
Okay. Yeah.
We got to get you to a hospital.
Okay. Uh, all right. Just, uh, back up. Who, uh– Who are these, uh– Umbrella people?
Why? You were cleared. Is it- Is it something you know, maybe?
Token. That’s code for? What are you talking about? How do you know any of this?
You voted to have people killed?
All right. So which way? 
Okay, um, uh, Samar, hold on. I– Can we just talk for a minute?
Uh, I was due for an upgrade anyway. Uh, what what are we doing here?
I need to tell you something. It was me. I told them.
Levi, he came to me, and Samar, you failed your polygraph. They thought you were acting suspicious during your exit interview and that you might be a traitor. I didn’t want them to hurt you, so I I told them about your condition. I thought I was helping.
Please.
Say something.
Be smart.
[ To students ] Stay in school.
It’s a standard SR-22. It won’t take a minute. In and out.
Certificate of insurance with the DMV.
Okay, so, the Mossad has sent trained killers after you. How do we fix this?
There’s got to be a way. There is always another way.
What about going to Mr. Cooper?
Mrs. Abramson – thank you.
What’s wrong?
How can you tell?
Let’s just focus on what is next. Okay, what is next?
Okay, so, where do I take us?
What? What? What?
No. Absolutely not. It’s about you and me. You don’t get to say goodbye. I won’t– I won’t let you. If you’re gonna go riding off into the sunset, I’m riding right beside you.
[ Angrily ] Stop saying that. Okay? It’s our life. You are my life. You are my business, and I get to decide if- if– Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Hang on.
Hang on. The- The- The business card.
Levi’s. He, uh– He gave it to me the last time I saw him, and I’m, uh–
I’m sorry. I didn’t even I didn’t even think that- that’s–
[ On phone ] Shots fired! Shots fired! Federal agents in need of assistance! 
I need another mag.
Where you at?
Samar! 
Those guys really won’t stop, will they?
Samar.
I’m fine with that, but what you said back at the car doesn’t work for me. I’m coming with you.
Listen. Listen to me. Listen. You say you don’t want me to go through that – the new life, the never looking back – but you do not have the right to make that decision for me. You cannot force me to live without you. That is not living. This is my decision, and I’m coming with you.
I have small feet.
Okay, we need to tell Mr. Cooper. I know he’d help in any way he can.
Whoa. I thought you said we’re in this together.
All right. Passage to where?
Okay. Okay. But what are you gonna do?
Yeah. That safe house.
Please. You be safe.
Thank you, sir.
You know, she’s always asking me that, and I honestly don’t know why. To me, it is it’s so simple. I just I want to be with the person I love, and I love her. So yeah, it’s what I want.
[ To all ] I don’t think Samar or I would be safe, alive, or even together if it weren’t for everything you’ve done for us over the years. Thank you. Uh, those, um– those words seem so small compared to what you’ve done.
What’s going on? Where’s Samar?
What are you talking about? We, uh– We have a plan. We have, um– We have papers, uh, money, uh, a place to go. I-I think you, um– I think you misunderstood.
Wait. You’re taking her away from me?
I want to know where she is!
You tell me where she is.
I want to talk to her. Call her. I know you can.
Where are you? W-What are you doing? We had a plan.
What about what we said? You and me, you know, we’re in this together.
They won’t find us.
No, no, no. I can’t be happy without you.
[ VOICE BREAKING ] Who’s gonna t-take care of you if I’m not there?
I will never!– forgive you for this!
Uh, yes. I’d like to close my account. The authorization codes? Of course yes, I’m ready. Access Delta 6-3-9. Echo-Uniform-Whiskey. That’s right. Liquidate everything. All $60 million.
So she hurts innocent people. Just like Mr. Reddington. What? You know it’s true.
I am focused, sir. I’m angry. But I’m focused. In ways I never thought possible.
TAC unit’s in place. They’re feeding us audio. Searching for CCTV feeds of the area now.
Still working on video.
Which means she’s broadcasting to this location.
I can try.
Okay, I’m not seeing anything matching this kind of video feed on any of the local towers.
Maybe. Maybe, but for a direct feed to be reliable, you’d have to be close.
Uh, within 5 or 10 blocks of the receiver.
Okay, okay, okay, she is transmitting a lot of data, so she’d have to use a high frequency.
Well, a lot of wireless cameras operate above 900 megahertz, like–
Okay, all right, all right. I got it. 982.5. Whoa. Wait. That’s weird.
I can see the signal strength, but it’s not constant.
 Uh, maybe, or she’s not stationary. I think maybe the signal’s being broadcast from a moving vehicle.
All right, the signal’s getting stronger. No, hang on you overshot it. Uh, make a right.
A van maybe? A small truck? Something with a visible antenna.
All right, she must have disconnected. I lost the signal.
I know. You’re gonna make sure of it.
Okay, so I was able to pull an image from a traffic cam at Culver and Talbot.
Not on the driver, but the trucks that cut you off were registered to Hammerstone Electric, which, uh, tells us nothing since I doubt you were attacked by a horde of angry electricians.
Right. One month ago, a private equity firm in New York bought up Hammerstone’s debt and shut them down.
And they were bought by Raincloud LBO, a New York firm specializing in hostile takeovers.
Well, I don’t normally drink, but under the circumstances – sure.
You took something precious from me.
So I took something precious from you.
When we were in Luxembourg, Dembe opened an account under your name at Banque Vertrauen. I kept a copy of the account-access fob we stole that day. It took you long enough to figure out what I did. Honestly, if you hadn’t walked in just now, I was thinking I was gonna have to tell you myself.
Not vengeance. Leverage. $60 million worth to get you to take me to Samar.
My bag’s packed, my goodbye notes written. I’m ready to face the consequences either way. Are you? 
I told you. I left her a note.
Is that why Liz called – because they need help?
How do you know that?
An attack? On what- where–
What is it code? Data? Is it encrypted?
[ Pause ] They can’t trace me to Samar until I’m with her. And I am not with her yet. This isn’t heaven or hell. It’s purgatory. And I can help from purgatory. So, please.
$273. That’s the interest per hour on $60 million. $2.4 million a year, $6,575 a day, $273 an hour.
I was being generous. The federal funds rate is 2.5.
25? Percent?
And if I solve the riddle?
I do. Um- Uh, that is- Uh, hi.
Uh, Mr. Reddington showed me what you sent to him.
Honestly? Uh – I have no idea.
Okay, so a few of the broken code strands look like they may have been trying to  overcome a firewall on CCTV cameras in Midtown, specifically 50th south to 38th.
Yes. Some of which were date-stamped as recently as last fall, so you’re looking for new construction.
Um, actually, Liz– [ BEEPING ] Agent Keen?
So. Where are we?
 You know, I do understand why Samar didn’t say goodbye. And I can accept why you helped her avoid that. But I couldn’t accept that we weren’t gonna be together.
She’s wrong. She thought I’d resent caring for her as her condition worsens. I won’t.
Samar is the strongest person I know.
Uh, yeah. Uh, about that –
Hey.
I was. I mean, uh, well, that’s where Mr. Reddington was gonna take me when- when you called.
No. And I’m not going to. I went because I love her. And I came back because I realized the best way to love her is to honor her wishes.
It was not. Or a cheap one. I owe Mr. Reddington $56,100.
I will explain over drinks. If you’re still up for going out. And- And paying.
Take your time. I got to run home and talk to someone first.
Can you hear me? I know you’re listening.
Watching me.
Hoping I might go to her – 
– but I won’t.
Do you hear me? 
She’s gone. She’s really gone.
All right. His name is Henry Morris. He lost $3,400 last night in Atlantic City. And based on bank records, over the past two years, he’s lost $196,000.
Henry Morris left the casino at 4:18 a.m. Hasn’t been seen since.
The woman Henry Morris killed in the bathtub was Betsy Nagel. Two weeks ago, she posted on her social media that she was #GratefulToBelnRecovery.
Well, in that same post, she shared a link to a website for G-A-R-T. It’s a support group for “gambling, addiction, recovery, and therapy.”
With multiple online poker accounts all linked to her credit cards.
Actually, not anymore. All of the gambling sites have been paid off and her accounts are all deactivated.
Well, I haven’t found an online identity associated with Morris in any of the chat rooms, and there wasn’t anything virtual about his debt.
I’ve searched everything. There is nothing these two people shared beyond their history of gambling.
And Miss Nagel is not alone. I looked into suspicious deaths of known gamblers who squared debts shortly before dying, and get this – Janice Deavers, a gunshot wound to the chest off the Vegas Strip. Jeff Warner, stabbed to death in the parking lot of a casino in Connecticut. And there are more.
I don’t know, but her cash supply seems endless.
Because she was never in the diner parking lot. I pulled security footage from the trucking company across the street. Check out the Buick with the “Bush/Quayle” bumper sticker.
The car is registered to an Agathe Tyche, 66, of Camden, Delaware. And she has a very, very sad story. Miss Tyche was an upstanding citizen of her community, married to a lifelong gambler, Lou Tyche. In 1986, Lou bought a lottery ticket and won $87 million, largest jackpot in Delaware history. Made national news.
Second child being born. It was a long, intense labor. Lou waited in the hospital, but at one point, he left with her son to make a run to a convenience store and bought a lottery ticket.
And the ticket was a winner. At the same time that Agathe was giving birth to her daughter, her son was dying three floors away while her husband was in surgery. The ticket was returned to her by a medic who found it in her husband’s effects.
Wait. After?
No. No, no, no, no. That’s not right. I pulled a death certificate for the son, but there was nothing for the husband. In fact, the Delaware State Gaming Commission is still recording annuity checks sent to an address near Wilmington.
Zoey Mercer, Oliver Paige, Matt Ford, Mia Walker, and Des Foy. Scions of oil, real estate, pharmaceuticals, and finance.
Surveillance vans with audio feeds are prepped and ready to go. Mr. Foy will be wearing a tracker.
His cell’s up. I got him pinned.
Uh, guys. That’s not his cell.
No, but I’m gonna try and triangulate that signal. I’m working on it now.
Hang on. I’m working on it.
Okay, guys, we got a problem. This signal is bouncing from mirror site to mirror site, and I can’t seem to– Whoa.
I lost signal. Caller hung up.
I’m working on that now.
Okay, yes, we got your spotter. Hotel rooftop. 137th and Rider.
All right, the spotter is packing up, headed for the fire escape on the east side of the building.
I feel like we’re responsible for what happened.
If we hadn’t lost the father, if I’d found that spotter, we could’ve found out where they were and stop–
What’s it?
Uh, what about the rack?
A torture device from the 18th century?
What about their cameras?
Uh, well, it appears they have IR bullet cams, uh, here, here, and here, which means it’s likely they have internal surveillance, too.
Well, if you could get me up to the building’s trunk line, there’s a chance I could splice into the multiplexer, get you access to their feeds.
Oh, I’m so sorry. Uh, Agent Mojtabai. And you’re – very commanding, sir.
Hi. Uh, Navid from, uh, uh, Insta- InstaCable. I got a- I got an install across the street. Their gang supply is mounted on your building. Mind letting me access the cable box?
Oh, oh. I, uh, I got to access that gang supply.
Maybe you, uh, don’t understand. If I call out a bucket truck, they’re gonna see that you’re bypassing the terminal block screw and they’re gonna fine you. It’s not to code. [ Turns to leave ] All right. Whatever, lady. Your problem.
Okay, just, um, hold on a second.
Look, um, whatever you think this is–
Hey. You’re, uh, what, like a– Like a guard? Tell me if the– The Whitmore boy, Tyler. Is, um – Is he here? Is he safe? If you let me talk to whoever’s in charge, I can help you. You have my wallet, my cell phone, so you know by now that I’m an FBI agent. I need to speak to whoever’s in charge, please.You hear me? Hey, hey, listen to me. Listen. I’m trying to help you. You need to get whoever’s in charge and tell them that the FBI is gonna call that phone right there any minute now. They’re- They’re gonna try to make contact, and when they do, you need to answer. Do you hear me? Come on.
You need to answer that phone.
Sir. Am I glad to see you.
I’m fine.
Listen. You have to let Tyler Whitmore go. Not me. You can keep me here, but the boy needs to be set free. If you don’t, they are gonna swarm this building, and it’ll be a show of force unlike anything that you have ever seen before. You don’t have to let me go. I can be your hostage. Me. I can be your hostage. But he’s got to walk. He’s got to walk.
If you let me help you –
I saw what you did to Des Foy. I watched him die. And I saw what it’s done to his parents. I’m- I’m begging you. Please. Come on. Don’t do that. Just Let Tyler Whitmore go.
Don’t do that.
Here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna tell me where Tyler Whitmore is, and you’re gonna help me get him out of this building. You hear me? Where is he?
Des? I– You’re alive? – I thought –
His lawyer’s here.
You know, I understand you’re angry. Angry at your father. My guess is you knew he was never gonna pay that ransom and that you felt like he didn’t care if you came home or not. For what it’s worth, I did. I wanted to see you get back home to your family. And I’m- I’m really sorry your friend Tyler didn’t.
I’m sorry.
What’s this?
You should know that I once held the high score on “Ms. Pac-Man” at Earl’s Pizza in Pike Creek, and I will not go easy on you.
Is this a new case?
Sure, but that might take awhile.
Place for what?
You don’t believe he’s responsible for this most recent murder? He’s in prison.
I’m a big fan of “Thaw,” too, and I can’t believe Mr. Reddington could listen to it and actually think that Tobias is guilty. That is crazy. It was obviously the professor.
Adrian McCaffrey. He teaches English at Brockton University and had all three victims as his students. In fact, “Thaw” uncovered that one of the victims, Lauren Key, had filed a suit against him for sexual harassment. Now, the university didn’t disclose this to the police during the first trial. How do you explain that?
Can anyone corroborate that?
Sir, you are not officially a suspect.
It’s just a-a-a few questions, like, um, about that sexual-harassment complaint.
I’m just curious why you think the college didn’t disclose the allegation during the original investigation.
Okay. Hang on. So- So you deny that one of the victims had reported that, uh, you had said, uh, “she looked good in her skirt, and that, if she was interested in a better grade, she should see you in your office after class”?
All of the victims have been your students. I mean – you have to admit that’s a little weird, right?
And the rumors you were sleeping with students?
Okay. So, get this. McCaffrey mentioned he got “everything he wanted” – in his divorce.
And so I thought I’d pull up the agreement and see what it included – all profits from his personally published works, a piece of art he and his wife purchased, and this [ BEEPS ] his family’s cabin. It’s isolated, private.
This could be the perfect place.
No, nothing on the APB. [ KEYS CLACKING ] I’m following up on that cold case I looked into for you.
I used your name to expedite the search and got 38 prints. 13 were in the system. Six of those were white men, but the oldest was 46.
I’m sorry. I can forward you the names I’ve pulled, if that would help.
Okay. Uh, so, I found something. You know how nobody has been able to locate Dr. McCaffrey?
No, I’m not really a wizard. I just waited for Mr. Cooper to get a warrant, then pinged his phone. He’s at the home of Margo Parish, another former student.
Do you have an alibi for the night Lauren Key was murdered six years ago?
With her?
But she’s–
The reason we looked at McCaffrey in the first place was because of his connection to Key.
If he’s not the killer–
It still doesn’t explain the death of a student in Stafford County or the abduction of Jenny Marciniak.
You think he’s the killer? 
According to birth records, Corinne was born March 2, 2011, to a Heather and Mark Walker, and Nora was born a day later and over 2,000 miles away to a Sara and Ben Mitchell.
What does a top Justice Department official have to do with a series of child abductions?
Well, you and New Dawn are the only thing connecting the abductions, so if you didn’t take them, who did?
You had some legal trouble before your time at New Dawn, right?
That must have been a very difficult time for you. Plus, the large settlement, legal fees, school debt –
The thing is, is five months later, you signed a mortgage and bought a new car.
I’d like to think it was a lucky break, the lottery, a bequest, even. But come on. I’m guessing that wasn’t it. Someone approached you, offered you money?
Those parents just want their girls back. If you tell us the truth, we can help you. Who approached you?
You switched the embryos.
I’m sorry. Did you say “three”?
The third child – remember her name? 
No. I think this is some sick, sci-fi version of human experimentation. I had the girls’ DNA sequenced. The differences are 90,000 base pairs. Now, that sounds like a lot, but when you consider that the human genome has about 3 billion base pairs, it’s nothing. My guess is that the person we’re looking for took a fertilized egg, split it into three embryos, and then made changes.
I would, except the insertions and deletions around the effected areas suggest that someone used a virally delivered editing tool to rewrite Corinne and Nora’s DNA.
Preliminary samples taken from her home suggest it wasn’t edited, which is what leads me to believe it’s some kind of experiment.
Okay, so, Rizal basically invented gene mapping. At 24, he wrote the code that runs the gene-sequencing software used by every hospital, laboratory, and university in the world.
The IPO was launched 12 years ago, and he resigned later that year.
Any word from Mr. Reddington? We still don’t know how any of this connects to Anna McMahon.
Family squabble?
His way or the highway.
Voicemail.
She didn’t pick up, either. If something happens to that kid or his family– Couldn’t we prevent that by just arresting Anna McMahon?
[ From Post Office ] Yeah. We’re patched into the system.
If he did, why wouldn’t he call the police?
Who is he?
So we have to find three people who don’t want to be found who are probably using fake names and cash.
You think there’s a chance they haven’t left the city?
Agents on scene identified the deceased as one Steven Jacob Tyson, a Special Agent detailed to the National Threat Assessment Center.
Right. I ran the info from the SIM card that you gave me. Now, that phone has only corresponded with four numbers in the past six months, none of which I’ve been able to ID. Now, I’m running a tap on all four now, but there’s nothing I can do until someone calls.
Yeah, we sent units to Whatley’s house, but he’s missing, and his computer’s gone.
Yes, it was.
Hey. So, I may have some good news.
No. Not yet, but I did check with the post office in Rosslyn, and it turns out that specific box that Grimm used to mail the drive was scheduled for a pick-up by the driver over three hours ago.
[ On phone ] No, uh, please. I need to talk to the postmaster. Yes. Urgent. Okay, ma’am, I already told you I’m with the FBI and that this is a matter– Okay. Yep. – I know you’re busy, too, but this –
[ Still on phone ] Um. Okay. I’m sorry. Uh, now I’m sorry. You’ve got to- You have to hold on. Give me a second. Okay. [ To Agent ] What is it?
No, no, no, no, no. Don’t do that. It’s about one of the four phone numbers we pulled from Agent Tyson’s burner.
Uh, one of them is live, like like right now. And it’s Anna McMahon.
I don’t know. Uh, I’m pulling it up.
Okay, whoever’s receiving the call, they’re on a burner.
I feel terrible. I voted for him.
Oh. No. Nothing. Uh, not yet. I sort of got distracted by the whole “President is part of the conspiracy” thing.
All right. I’ve got bad news. Now, the mail truck is a Grumman LLV built 30 years ago, so there’s no radio, no GPS.
That’s the thing. The driver’s name is Earl Wilson. 45. Married, with two kids. Now, the two kids are in middle school, which is why the wife says they use an app to track their family’s movement.
He was logged in before the signal died, but his last location was headed northeast on Rhode Island Avenue, just past Eckington, which is over 8 miles off his route.
No. And that’s the problem. The vehicle was traveling at 68 miles per hour when the signal went dead.
Sir. Sir. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] I think I figured it out. Uh- Not by tracking the driver of the postal truck, but Sandquist.
I can’t believe I didn’t think of it before. He is Secret Service. So I accessed their employment files, which is, like, total legal, and I pulled his phone number–
–which is not so legal.
Six miles north of where Earl Wilson’s cellphone went dead.
They’re here.
Okay, just, uh, give me a second. Okay. I need to make sure we run this through our AV malware.
All right. Here we go.
There’s a hyperlink here.
There is a lot of data-sourcing here. 
I’m sorry, but, uh, am I understanding this correctly? The American President is part of a plot to assassinate himself.
Uh, okay, well, it looks like the Third Estate will be protesting at the venue.
Murder? Wh- Um –
Ressler. What’s going on?
Okay, this is, uh- This is weird, right?
We need a plan.
Pretty sure that’s not part of Agent Keen’s plan.
Agent Keen? Wait. Can they hear us?
They’d have to be very capable.
Well, yeah, but if you bypass the signal, the war room monitors will stream the same data over and over again. They’d be blind. – Oh!
He doesn’t think he can blow through The Box, does he? It’s titanium-gold alloy.
Listen. Even if he could blow through the foundation, which is impossible, he’d likely kill us in the fall.
Passcode. It’s- It’s “Samar.”
Uh, we just broke out of a black-site facility.
Um, are those- Are those French toast kabobs?
Well, the debate’s taking place at Fillmont University, and campus security is in the same building as the student union.
So, uh, what’s with all the, uh, security?
How comforting.
Wait. Wait. Is that true?
This is amazing.
Okay. Mr. Cooper? Mr. Cooper, I think I may have found something. I’m in their network now, and– This is weird, but one of their cameras is down.
Well, the system says it’s offline for a self-diagnostic, but according to their blueprints, the room that it’s watching is some sort of lighting booth on the fifth floor.
That’s gotta be it, right? I mean, that’s our shooter.
[ Computer KEYS CLACKING ] All right. I’m bringing up the blueprints now. I’m gonna guide you.
 Okay, when you exit the stairwell, there is a service hallway to your left.
All right, when you get to the fifth floor, make a right. The lighting room is about 40 yards down the hall, top of the stairs.
Right there. Straight ahead.
Not really, no.
Shooting a clay pigeon’s a lot easier than killing a President.
Maybe he got cold feet.
If it’s, uh- If it’s all the same to you, I-I think we’re good here.
But, um, w-we’re not trying to escape.
How many are you?
How many?
Come on!
There’s six of them! Ressler.
Drop it!
Go, go, go! Go!
That’s us. Wanted in connection with shooting at the President.
Okay, so, I ran background checks on all the applicants.
Would be, if she weren’t three months behind on her rent.
Two stints in rehab.
17 unpaid parking tickets.
One scofflaw in the family is enough.
You know, after Samar left, I spent six months drowning my sorrows in kielbasa and Ingmar Bergman movies. Then Ressler insisted I sign on to a dating app. When I refused, he signed up for me. I swear, he is more of a yenta than my own yenta. First three names he swipes right on their background checks – bankruptcy, credit-card fraud, and a restraining order for slashing their ex-boyfriend’s tires. Now we are both eating Polish sausage and playing chess with Death.
Okay, so, I reviewed all the CCTV footage from the Paris neighborhoods that Dembe thought Mr. Reddington might have gone to. Nothing. Wherever he went, he didn’t want to be seen.
I didn’t know we had an 0100 number.
[ Whispers ] Is any of this true?
Suspects what? What- What was all that?
Hang on, hang on. Mr. Reddington goes 30 years without getting caught, and now he’s been caught twice within the last year.
Wasn’t caught? He was nearly executed.
Why would you do that?!
Wait. Wh- [ LAUGHING ] What? And you knew about this?
Reddington, who you say is dead.
Which one?
Let me get this straight. Raymond Reddington is your father.
But he’s dead because you shot and killed him.
And after he dies, your mother, Katarina Rostova, puts you in foster care and escapes from the KGB, FBI, and the Cabal with the help of her oldest friend, Ilya Koslov, who nips and tucks his way into becoming Mr. Reddington in order to access the millions that the real Reddington didn’t even know he had, in order to finance her disappearance. Is that it?
You’re definitely gonna need therapy. And now that you’ve told me, so am I.
But, uh, you went to the embassy and spoke to the attaché.
I’ll issue a BOLO, circulating the image with MPD and surrounding jurisdictions.
If we tell Justice who Mr. Reddington really is, will they shut us down?
As soon as we pull a warrant, we can get Hansen to tell us who that is.
I’m guessing he’s not waiting for a warrant.
Hey. So, um, I was able to trace the payment Hansen received to an account in Paris. Now, the account’s in the name of a shell corporation, so the I.D. trail is a dead end, but and I  am 74% confident there is something to this I found several other payments out of the Paris account, one of which was used to rent a small warehouse in Annapolis.
So, three other payments were made to rent medical equipment that, according to the rental company, were sent to that same warehouse.
I know we think he’s in Paris, but maybe that’s just another illusion.
Got it.
What about local authorities?
Understood. Address is on its way.
What we want to know is who he worked for.
We assume the injuries were, too.
A description, then.
But not as smart as Steinhil, who kept everything need-to-know. None of them know the name of the woman who hired him to con Mr. Reddington.
Mr. Reddington went to meet with someone he felt safe enough with that he didn’t bring Dembe.
From Dembe? That must be some secret.
Sir.
Definitely. I did what you said and followed up with the Medical Examiner’s Office, and they didn’t know what I was talking about.
They don’t have Steinhil. I mean, they never even got him. Apparently, the call we made requesting they respond to the scene was canceled.
Well, the log says by Special Agent Gerald Host. G. Host, as in —
All right, I combed through every database, and there’s nothing concrete on Fleurs du Mal, only rumors about a man given a knife and locked in a room with a tiger, a woman who fell off the Eiffel Tower, and something about piranhas.
You did?
Uh- how could you know that?
On what?
Did you go to the police?
Sounds terrifying.
Do you know how to make contact?
Sir. Sir, there is nothing on Thelonious Prackett. It’s- It’s got to be an alias. But whoever he is, he agreed to let Mrs. Radcliffe recommend a new member.
Prackett agreed on one condition that if the new member gets invited to an event, Radcliffe has to go with.
Yeah, um, about that. If, um If we’re doing this, I’d like to go with her.
We need to be a convincing couple to have a connection, and we have one I can relate to her loss.
Not that what I went through even compares.
I’m fine. Um, still a bit, uh, numb, [ CHUCKLES ] I guess. But, um, when the last real feeling you had was devastation, you’re not super psyched to get out there and feel again. But
That I’m good, or- or devastated?
We met at Ascot. I had a horse racing in the Dubai Shergar Cup.
Fractured his left-front pastern. Had to be put down. Cost me $300,000 in stud fees.
40 studs a year, that’s $12 million per year.
Until I saw Elodie. Things brightened considerably after that.
I was a guest in one of the royal boxes, and she was three rows below, and still the peacock feathers in her hat blocked my view.
 I don’t see why. I can buy anything I want. So, naturally what I want is something I cannot buy.
Why is that unusual?
I understand your caution and why you need to vet your guests as closely as you do. I would expect nothing less. But we’ve told you our story, we’ve exchanged wiring instructions, and I’m one text away from depositing $1 million into your account.
Of course not, which is why I’m all the more happy to pay for it. So, I need to know –  Are we in, or are we out?
He will. We sold our story well, but if you’re uncomfortable–
With an ELT beacon. We’ll smuggle the device in disassembled so we can get it past security.
No. We don’t. It’ll be okay. I promise.
Cheers.
Hmm.
I have no idea.
I need to tie my shoe.
Mm. Hand me the antenna.
What? Oh.
Uh- We, uh- Hmm. We were, uh- We were just, uh, talking about how delicious those little shrimp tartlets are.
I am a foodie.
I am- I’m such a foodie. I’m- I’m a foodie.
I have no idea and I don’t want to find out.
Let’s keep moving, shall we? Okay.
They choose one from the guests.
I don’t know what’s taking so long. It’s online and transmitting.
No, it doesn’t matter where we are. It’s GPS activated.
I don’t know. But the only thing that could possibly interfere would be a sun-flare — a jammer.
I don’t think so.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay,  Elodie, we’re gonna figure this out. We’re gonna figure this out. It’s gonna be fine. It’s gonna be fine.
I’m gonna come for you, okay?
[ Softly ] Come on, guys.
What? No.
Um–
–could you, uh could you just, uh, uh, give me a minute?
Mr. Prackett’s gonna be very upset with you.
[ GASPING ] FBI! Everybody on the ground. Nobody move.
I don’t know.
[ WHISPERING ] Shh, shh.
I don’t know.
What was that for?
We have to keep moving.
We’re almost there.
Let her go.
I’m an FBI agent, and you’re gonna let her go.
She had nothing to do with this. I’m the one you want.
Uh – eventually.
She’s, uh– She’s okay. You know, I think part of her found all the danger exhilarating. It’s crazy, right?
As opposed to being okay with feeling numb.
Hey.
I wanted to come by to make sure you were okay.
I also, uh, stopped by, uh, to say that that you shouldn’t, um you know, feel badly about–
Kissing me.
You shouldn’t feel badly about that at all.
Absolutely not.
Sir. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Uh, this just came in over SIPRNet. Odd, right?
It was sent from an unofficial CIA outpost in Zahedan.
I decoded it myself.
Yes, sir. But who is Daniel Hutton?
Okay, I’ve got eyes on the checkpoint.
 Got it. Okay, looks like they shoved him into a blue sedan. All right, tracking from there, they headed northwest, made their way to what looks like some kind of old palace or estate outside Zahedan.
Mr. Reddington called in a drone strike. From a gaming store.
Other than that he can call in a drone strike from a gaming store.
Oh, uh, that’s, um– Uh, sorry.
Theoretically, if a healthy person is injected with a high concentration of cancerous cells and those cells got into his or her bone marrow, they could, you know, catch leukemia.
Yeah, just – a super bad one.
The WMD Directorate oversaw our response to the Libyan bioweapons. If Devane is the mastermind, he might be on their radar.
Yes. Exactly. I’m the “other man” to– I mean, I’m not yet, but – I want to be. Which is worse.
Great? I slept with a married woman.
Uh, we called ahead asking for any information your office had–
Your company does diagnostic testing for hospitals and clinics all across the country, which means your system has information.
“He” is right here, tracing the hack.
It’s a gift.
Okay. That’s weird. Um, not- not your advice. Well, uh– Well, definitely your advice. But it looks like, uh, Kuragin hacked the system to give some root access that they used to order a test.
Full genome sequencing on a 13-year-old boy named Marcus Sinclair.
Actually- Actually, it seems like they hired him to sequence the genes of 20 teenagers.
Devane used the hack to identify patients who fit a specific demographic, then sampled and sequenced their DNA using NDL’s automated system.
[ Practicing ] “It’s Aram.”
Hey, uh, Elodie. It’s, um– It’s- It’s Aram. Mojtabai.
Yeah, I, uh- I know it’s, uh, been two weeks since I’ve I’ve called. I wanted to. I just, um–  You have no idea how much I, um– Okay, um, a friend says I should tell you I was busy at work, but I wasn’t. I mean- I mean, I was. I just– Uh, not not too busy to call.
Yeah. You’re- You’re married. You’re loving, honoring, and, uh, cherishing – while I am– I am lusting. Which, of the seven deadly sins, if I’m not mistaken, is, uh, Number One with a bullet.
Um– uh, sure.
That, uh– That sounds, uh, fancy. You, uh– Are you sure it’s okay if I join?
Sir, I found a connection. In the files we pulled from National Diagnostics, each of the boys listed two addresses – one where their families lived, which were all different, and a second one, which was all the same.
Became Abbott students.
Devane had Benjamin Gansky’s genome tested in February 2012, seven months before he enrolled. He tested Peter Crane four months before he enrolled in 2016.
One. Howard Keller.
Sir? [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Okay. Uh, so, I should’ve caught this before, so let me start by saying, um, I’m sorry.
You know how you told me to notify the headmaster at Abbott and let him know that Howard Keller may be in danger?
It’s not what he said. It’s who he is. The headmaster at Abbott Boarding School is Kelvin Mitchell, and his son, Thomas Mitchell, is on the list of names Devane hacked from National Diagnostics.
Mister?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Uh, we’re going to a wedding?
Crashing. As- As Mr. and Mrs. Bloom?
The song is, uh– Song’s great. Us, um– Us being here, it’s– 
[ CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY ]
Uh– [ CHUCKLES ] Excuse me?
Oh, yes, but, um–
I have no idea.
Mrs. Bloom?
Wanna dance? 
Uh– [ CHUCKLES ] Excuse me?
Oh, yes, but, um–
Could be sabotage by a hostile foreign power.
Okay, so, the video was shared over 8,500 times in the first five minutes alone, but I was able to trace the very first upload to an account named Mr.-underscore-Rite362, but the problem is–
Yeah, I was just explaining how the video originated from the Reddit handle. I pulled the ISP. Turns out this guy bounced all over the Internet, hiding his location with a VPN.
Not yet, no.
We do? I mean, uh, what do you mean?
Okay, I’ll just, uh I’ll just hang tight. I’ll be right here if anyone needs me.
We know what a rootkit does.
I hope so, because it’s obvious.
Is that what you think this is about? Because it doesn’t feel like she’s replacing Samar. It feels like she’s here to replace me. And by the way, I’m seeing Elodie now and very, very happy about it. Sure, there there are a couple of obstacles.
Okay, you know what? Right now, we are living in the moment and having a great time doing it. In fact, I am supposed to meet her for lunch, and since you all have such confidence in Agent Perfect-In-Every-Way, that is what I’m going to go do.
When you said there was this amazing place to have lunch, I assumed you meant an amazing restaurant.
This is someone’s house.
Someone lives here.
This is great. What am I doing? I, um – Hello. I’m here.
[ Muttering to himself ] Uh, I’m, uh enjoying the architecture – and, you know, the breaking and entering. This is ridiculous. This is not gonna end well.
This is crazy. Knock, knock.
I definitely feel something.
You’re gonna be the death of me.
Sh –
It’s, uh, it’s okay. Uh, uh, um, I’m a- I’m a FBI agent. [ Shows badge ]
Uh, I’m, uh, I’m arresting this woman.
It’s not what it looks like.
Yeah, on our way.
And illegal.
That woman was terrified, and so was I. You know, she could’ve had a gun.
Elodie, we broke the law.
Listen, I am an FBI agent. I do not break the law. [ Under his breath ] Oh, God.
Okay, w-wait. Fleet runs NSA-level encryption. They’d know if their system’s been compromised.
Okay, then we have two problems. I spoke to Dr. Powell’s assistant, who said she never arranged a meeting between him and Tracy Long. In fact, she hasn’t been able to reach Dr. Powell at all.
Dr. Powell?
Hello? FBI! Open the door!
Dr. Powell?
Dr. Powell?
Dr. Powell. You want to tell me what’s going on? 
Dr. Powell, what are you doing? Dr. Powell, look. Just communicate with me, okay? [ RESPIRATOR CONTINUES HISSING ]
You’re what, a- an A.I. program?
Clark.
Okay. But, um, what do you mean you took, uh you took Dr. Powell offline?
And you’ve taken over the systems at FleetAI, haven’t you, Clark?
My friends are in that building, and they will die if you do not restore access to–
The Singularity.
And the programming Dr. Powell created – you think you’re too advanced, so- so you killed him. You killed all the other A.I. scientists.
You’re destroying their work.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! If- If we do that, we could we could destroy it.
Because we could lose all of his research.
Okay, just– Th-Th-There’s got to be another way.
No, no, no, no, don’t do that.
Don’t, Clark.
Okay, just get it offline.
Any word on how much of Dr. Powell’s data can be recovered?
The rise of the machines is a good thing.
It was a psycho computer. There are psycho people. It doesn’t mean we’re all bad.
I never saw it.
Yeah, I don’t really like dark future stories. I figure people should be given the benefit of the doubt. Which is something I didn’t give you. I’m sorry. I should have.
Wait. You’re leaving?
I’m sure it’s not.
Okay, so, I thought about what you said. About, um, how my being uncomfortable with risks and craziness was a dealbreaker.
It’s just – That’s- That’s never been me. I mean, when I was a kid, the only thing I ever broke into was my middle-school gym locker, and that’s only because Mr. McCutcheon was going to fine me if I didn’t return my gym clothes.
You do?
Yeah?
I was thinking maybe — just maybe — we could be the death of each other.
So, uh, what’d the governor say when he walked into your office?
I’ll run a search.
So, um – are you religious?
No, I, uh I-I love it when people have values.
Check this out. A little blue pill. Maybe Sweeney was having sex parties in here and lied to cover it up.
This one– This one’s a genius. I mean, I thought I was smart, but I’m telling you, she is off the charts.
Okay, so, I found a pill in the storage room where Governor Sweeney was dumped. And, well, you tell them.
Why?
That’s incredible.
So we traced that lot number to a local medical clinic that ordered this particular batch. We have an address.
Why are they making this so easy? Call for emergency medical support.
[ On phone ] Agent Park, have you got eyes?
No, no, no, no, no. Think.
This is the man who raped you.
Hannah, don’t! Don’t. Come on. Your little girl wouldn’t want you to do this.
Hannah, I think it’s safe to say that you’ve made history, but it’s over now.
Hannah, don’t. Don’t. Wait! No!
I’m sorry, you’ve been here like 9 seconds. How are you already more jaded than Agent Ressler?
Okay, Mr. Reddington said that when we arrested him, Bhavish Ratna was moving funds to pay a contractor named Eli Atticus.
And we think his next job may be right here at home.
14 employees were arrested. Several were injured. But one man, Alfred Yang, remains in stable condition, under police custody, at Nations First Hospital.
He’s gonna grab Alfred Yang before he ever gets to prison.
[ Typing ] All right. Burke’s a jewel thief. Milan. Hong Kong.The Tel Aviv Diamond Exchange. Now, her whereabouts are unknown, but it looks like her partner took the fall when they tried to steal the Dresden Green, the world’s largest green diamond. Appears he’s awaiting trial at the MDC in Brooklyn.
Agent Keen. So, uh, this came for you through the Hoover Building.
Oh, my God. That- That must have been terrifying.
Did they see anything?
Hang on. Hang on. There. Go back.
Any idea who they are?
I can’t believe the man in the park was Russian Vory.
She canceled her cell service or has a new account under a different name. By hiding from her abuser, she managed to hide from us.
Mr. Reddington, we’ve been through every file four times now.
Uh, guys, I think we’re missing a file here – 46-J.
You don’t think she took the file?
I am.
Chernov. I know I know I’ve heard that name.
The wedding. A wedding. A few weeks ago, Elodie and I crashed this wedding. Well, she actually she stole these name tags, which is quite easy to do, by the way, because they just leave them right out there in the open.
Yeah?
Right. Okay. So, I’m standing there wearing this name tag, and this guy comes over to me, thinking that I am Frank Bloom.
Yeah. Why? Were you invited?
Like I said, they just leave them out in the open.
I can tell you that is not the name he goes by.
No. But I can get it. I can get it. [ He runs out ] I can get it.
Okay. So, the guy who thought I was Frank Bloom gave me this.
I know. But, uh, I got to say – it was pretty awesome.
Yep.
Oh, hey. Just in time.
The name you got, Berdy Chernov, he and the woman from Paris live across the hall from Agent Keen. We’re heading there now.
Yeah, thank God. I just patched her through to Mr. Cooper.
[ On phone ] Agents Ressler and Mojtabai, FBI. We need a perimeter on that building – Evergreen to First and Dove Hill Road to Brighton.
White female, late 50s, possibly accompanied by a white male, both likely armed and dangerous. Nobody goes in or out of that building until we’re on site.
We just got here.
[ To an tech ] Okay. Thank you.
Agent Keen. Thank God you’re okay. Come on. We were so worried.
MPD finished a sweep of the building. We were too late.
I wouldn’t say that exactly.
Well, when you put it that way–
Okay, um, what we do is full service – And classified.
Why do you wanna know all this?
Okay, all right, now you’re actually scaring me.
Forgers don’t have to be great artists, just great engineers.
No matter how good a forger is, he’s basically copying, right? And there are technical ways of doing that, like camera obscura.
By using mirrors, you can project an image onto a canvas, and if you project that image in small sections, you can essentially do a paint-by-numbers masterpiece.
Wait, Agnes is in Sleeping Beauty?
Sorry? Oh, uh, sorry. Um, Elodie’s husband had a heart attack this morning and was rushed to the hospital. I’m waiting to hear how he’s doing.
Can I ask you something? Um, do you think it’s natural when someone is suffering as much as he is to want them to find some peace?
Do you think it’s natural to want that when you’re in the next room sleeping with his wife?
Not for Elodie. If you’d seen her this morning, you’d know that all she wants is what’s best for him.
There’s no video after the explosion, but, uh, what about before? How far back can you go?
Okay, the car’s registered to a Richard Vitaris. I’ve got a Maryland address.
Vitaris is the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company owned by the Fenbergs. Now, if the lawsuit is to be believed, then they are as bad as the Sacklers 🔘 [See Note] – Misleading the public and the FDA on how addictive their drugs are.
That’s right. After a football injury, he was prescribed painkillers, got hooked, overdosed a year later.
It appears so, yes.
We’ve identified a suspect, but we’re not sure what role he played or if he was acting alone. We believe that he may have an accomplice.
The Leyster was taken three months after you loaned it to the Olympian Gallery.
One thing you can do is to go through your entire collection. Now, I know that is a logistical nightmare, but if you have pieces on loan, get them back, and authenticate everything.
Elodie, hey. Uh, what’d the doctor say?
So that’s good, right?
What do you mean, what do I think?
Thinking what exactly?
No, that is not what I was thinking at all. Why would– Why would you say that?
Um, look, I’m so sorry. I’m gonna have to call you back. I have, uh, work.
Wait. I have a lead on that. Okay, so, looking at the previous forgeries from the Fenberg collection, it seems that the counterfeiter specializes in replicating pieces from the 19th century or before. Now, according to the Fenbergs’ portfolio, the only painting left in their collection that matches that description is a Hoogstraten worth $24 million.
You’re amazing.
Well, not really. But – you think so. We think so about each other, which is, well– Amazing.
No. I want to break up.
I don’t want to. I mean, it’s the last thing I want. It’s just, we should. That is, we have to.
What do we do when we’re together? We trespass. We– We crash weddings. We break the law.
Exactly, yes, which I still can’t believe how small it was, right? Scratch that. That’s off-topic. Okay. My point, such that I have one, is this. Making love in a rocket ship is one thing, one– One amazing thing, but, Elodie, hoping your husband dies, there is nothing amazing about that. How is he?
I am so sorry.
This is a really bad idea.
Oh, my God. The cutest.
Now may seem like an odd time to mention it, but the men in my family have a low sperm count.
When I’m 10,000 feet off the ground, that’s what I think about.
Dying. And, uh, before I die, [ Stammers ] I-I’d like to have kids. [ Looking out the window ] Oh!
What? Oh. Okay. Do you, uh– Do you want to have kids?
But you deserve to be happy.
Is that out of, um, you know, guilt or obligation or lifestyle?
Oh. Oh, gosh.
[ Nervously ] Oh, of course. So, um, where does that– Uh, where does that leave you and– And me and–
Ahhh! Ahhh! This is a bad idea!
Ahhh! Whoo! [ Screaming ]
Wh- wh- whoo-ooo! 
Sorry I’m late. I was jumping out of an airplane. Really. Uh, skydiving. Have, uh, any of you ever done it? It’s, um, insane.
There’s also the privacy angle. Optimus collects metadata on citizens whether they like it or not.
Okay, so whoever did this cut the power on purpose, showed up in a stolen truck to fix it, and then got waved in like a Trojan horse.
Would you have stayed with Tom if he didn’t want children?
I want to stay with Elodie, but I also want a relationship with a future. And–  You know what? Forget it. Here.
Elodie wants kids, but they can’t have any. And– Samar was different.
So you think my being with Samar and Elodie means I don’t want children?
Internal company data, personnel files, contracts, lobbying.
Exactly, and besides the van connecting Healy to Optimus, this was in the stolen files–  A series of hidden payments made from Optimus to Healy and to a woman named Libby Bishop in 2015.
Um, uh, right. Uh, Bishop, Bishop. She is another member of the city council.
I’m sorry. Uh, it’s Elodie. Her husband, uh, he’s back in the hospital. 
Elodie.
How is he?
All right, good.
So, I’ve been thinking about–
Oh.
No, please. You first.
Okay. Wow. Maybe I should have gone first. Because what I’ve been realizing is that I think too much and that I need to stop thinking and just feel. And when I do that, I feel like I want to be with you.
I’m looking in the only direction that matters. And I’m telling you I do.
It’s okay.
Uh, I am. So sorry. Aram Mojtabai. Uh, we met, uh, after Charles’ accident. 
I know she was devoted to him. 
So sorry. Uh, would you excuse me one– 
Thank you. 
Agent Keen, is everything okay? 
She’s, um– She’s holding it together. 
Shockingly calm. 
When I got to the hospital, before we knew that, uh, Charles had passed, we, um– I took your advice and stopped thinking. And the minute I did, everything just clicked into place.
I realized that’s why I like her so much. 
She doesn’t think. She– She feels. 
She lives in the moment, and she stays there. 
Not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard.
Like– Like with Charles. She didn’t stay with him out of guilt or obligation. She stayed with him because it’s the right thing – 
I have to call you back. 
Elodie lied about not having a prenup. And now that her husband’s dead, she stands to inherit millions.
Maybe, but he didn’t have a medical directive, and she couldn’t have know what was going on inside of his head.
Exactly.
No. Wait. Wait, what?
I want to know if Elodie killed her husband. If she did, I have to arrest her. I’m definitely– I’m definitely breaking up with her. But I don’t really know yet, But I need to know, you know?
Oh, um– whether Elodie killed her husband.
I should go and let the two of you do whatever it is you two do.
If this is about your libido, I’m– I’m good.
Wait, the Triangle’s real?
A place where some people go and never return. Supposedly 16,000 in the last 50 years.
This is former U.S. House Majority Leader Hale Boggs. Now, in 1972, his twin-engine Cessna vanished somewhere between Juneau and Anchorage. The nation’s largest search-and-rescue mission was mounted. The Coast Guard, Civil Air Patrol, the Navy. All scoured the area for months, but no trace of Boggs’ plane was ever found.
Mr. Reddington thinks they went down with the shipment.
The container numbers. They’re marked on the roof for the benefit of crane operators, so I was able to pull them from the photos.
Someone really wants to talk to you.
Oh, you never talk about your brother.
[ To himself, as he rolls a syringe between his fingers ] She is kind and nice. He’s in a better place. And I– I’m a total diphthong.
Hey, hey. [ Chuckles ] Uh, you want a ride? I, uh, figured you wouldn’t want to do this alone.
The guy outside your place, he, um– he looked so familiar.
Of course. They, um– They lost a friend.
Picking a casket is a big decision, so while I, uh, hunt for a bathroom, you take your time. Charles is gonna have to live with your choice for, like, ever.
Oh. Sorry about that. Sorry.
Charles. My, uh, deepest sympathies. I, uh– I know this is super awkward. [ Zipper zips ] But I think this might be in your best interest. Quick stick. Oh, God. Oh.
I got it. I got the goods.
The sample, the blood sample. I have it.
A bike path.
[ To Red, low voice ] Fort Slocum. Midnight. Got to go. Got to go. Thanks.  [ Hangs up ]
Hey.
Yeah. Sorry. Everything’s– Everything’s fine. Did you, uh– Did you find a casket?
You, uh– You want me to put the item in– in the basket?
[ Calling after ] Do I, um– Do I get a receipt or– anything? No? Shalom.
Everybody on the ground. Nobody move.
Records division? Yeah, this is Special Agent Aram Mojtabai. I’d like to request the case file for Thelonious Prackett. Yeah, with a “P.”
That was Mr. Reddington. I, uh, patched him through to the call and told him about Agent Park.
Nothing as important as finding Agent Park. Mr. Reddington.
Wilbur Eaton? Special Agent Aram Mojtabai. FBI.
I read the testimony. I know what you did for Prackett. You made the torture chambers that killed or disabled anyone who was put in them, including Charles Radcliffe. And yet, you were at his widow’s house yesterday.
For the death of a man you almost killed.
Your immunity agreement required full disclosure about any and all crimes involved in Prackett’s ventures. If you fail to disclose one, the deal will be torn up, and you will go to prison. Why were you really at her house?
Because of the prenup. Wait. Wait, why does she owe you money?
What did you do for her?
Sit down.
Explain what? That Charles didn’t find Les Fleurs du Mal? You did.
Selected to die.
But Charles didn’t die. And then I showed up. When we insisted you go to The Defiance, you got Eaton to pick you. I thought I was saving you, but– you two had worked out a way for you to save yourself.
No. You used me. You got me to open up to you. That’s why you kept asking about Blacklisters. To seduce me into giving you a murder weapon.
Your word, then– Did you kill him?
Did you kill Charles?
I hope that’s true. 
Thank you.
You have the right to remain silent.
[ Voice-over ] Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. 
Do you understand these rights I have just read to you?
Or because Kemp sells guns? Mr. Reddington sells them, too. Maybe he’s targeting a competitor.
Damn right, he heard.
Good to go. I’ve got three routes mapped out and agents are on-site.
I can track each route via satellite. Just need to know which one’s real.
Checking CCTV feeds. Confirming all routes are clear.
Cameras are up.
All right, here we go.
Okay, Agent Ressler, stay south on 21 toward Independence.
Agent Park, CCTV shows you are clear. So you want to take the second exit. Confirm, second exit.
Yes, Agent Keen, that is right. Stay on State Road 65 for 12 miles.
Smoke. Hang on. Uh, no. Uh, no, there are no accidents reported in that area.
Okay, this is, uh, terrible, but sex workers are like 20 times more likely to be targeted by serial killers.
What do you mean they thought your profile wasn’t “additive”?
I think I may have something. As you may know, genetic material passes from mother to child during pregnancy, but what you may not know is it also happens in reverse. Fetal cells cross the placenta and enter the mother’s body, making up as much as 10% of the free-floating DNA in her bloodstream.
Well, with the M.E.’s help, I was able to run the fetal DNA from Mara James against databases from genetic testing services. And with almost absolute certainty, the father of her child is – Jonathan McClaire.
The same. Author of six books. He runs workshops all around the world.
Right, uh, about that. Here’s the thing. He didn’t kill her.
Because he died 11 months before Mara James was murdered. 
Mr. Reddington pays for his wife’s angina medication?
The victims we’re aware of all had children out of wedlock with very wealthy men, and they all made paternity claims against the fathers, which were all settled.
According to his employment records, he used to operate a funeral home outside Rehoboth Beach.
452 Elm, the same as the mortuary he currently operates – Sweet Rest Funeral Home.
Kendra. Hi. I’m, um, Agent Mojtabai. [ Door closes ] You’re, uh– You’re not under arrest.
Yeah. About that– Let me– Let me get that for you.
To talk about a man named Nyle Hatcher.
Right, um– This one runs a funeral home.
And– he murders women.
By getting you pregnant and suing the father for paternity.
And the baby?
Adopted. Because the father would already be dead. 
You never met Roger Ashby?
Is that what Hatcher told you, it was gonna be a hookup?
Because Roger Ashby died yesterday in a ferry-boat accident.
Once the settlement was finalized, Hatcher would take the money, and you’d end up dead. 
Hey, um, guys, so, uh– Kendra says that she and the target never met. But that Hatcher told her she’d be impregnated tomorrow. By a man who died yesterday. So what am I missing?
Um, the birds and the bees? What’s the new wrinkle?
I found her. Angela Hendrickson. Now, she’s not answering our calls, but she received a call outside a Rockville Fire station 30 minutes ago, and her cell just pinged a tower off county road 75.
That is Cedar Wind Cemetery in Livingston. [ Ringing ] Oh, cemetery. That’s bad.
That’s, uh– That’s really bad.
And the kids? 
What’s being done about the kids?
[ Silently mouths “His lawyer” ]
[ On radio ] Okay, Agent Keen, the address you gave me isn’t in the system. It’s an unknown.
Inmates? Wait–
Hang on? Why? What’s going on?
Sir, Marvin Gerard was right. Evidently, Martin smuggled several inmates out of Wallens. They’re heavily armed and on the move.
That’s unclear.
Okay, I have units en route.
Copy. Part of the Marshals’ fleet. You think that’s–
Copy. 
Agent Keen. I just hung up with the Marshals, and they’re holding a witness named Sarah Wims. Now, she’s the lead witness in a murder trial and is being held next door to the address you gave me.
Marshals are getting word to their teams now and has units on their way.
Sir, just got off with the DA. Sarah Wims testified. Looks like guilty on all counts.
Well, I looked over the ledger, and it gives us every name but one. The person who hired him to take the imam.
Merwin is an MIT graduate with degrees in quantitative economics and financial mathematics. He’s a forensic accountant who moves money for criminals and criminal syndicates around the world.
Billing address is a PO box in Logan Circle, but last-known residence is in Jarrettsville.
Ex-wife. One daughter.
Guys, I got it, a trace on the call that came into Pearl Merwin’s cellphone.
A landline in Manassas– the Whitmore Hotel.
A lead? Uh, yes. Well, that is, I think so.
It’s, uh– Well, you know.
No. The thing is, is, uh, m-maybe I should tell Mr. Cooper first.
Stanley Birch.
He runs a chess shop in Adams Morgan.
Uh, sir, I, uh, I may have told Mr. Reddington about Birch.
Uh, a desire to, you know – uh, live?
