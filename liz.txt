Babe, what time is it?
Oh, crap.
Crap!
No! My first day!
I missed the bus, babe. I’m gonna need to take the car.
You took the dog out, right?
The zoo’s gender neutral.
 Is this pee? I’m standing in pee, babe.
Yeah, thanks a lot. I’m gonna smell like a urinary tract infection on my first day!
Yep. One–thirty. Last meeting.
Yeah, in my pocket.
No more peeing, dude.
 I think I’m forgetting something.
You know I’m not gonna let this job come between us and our family, right?
We want a family, we’re going to have a family.
Today’s the day.
Thanks.
No. But I am very late.
Babe, I don’t think I’m gonna need to take the car.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I know who you are, sir.
I wish I could. I can tell you that I’ve been vetted by the agency like everyone else, you know, same background checks, psych profiles. I’m sure OPR’s trolling my digital footprint right now, and I can tell you what they’ll find.
Nothing. I have no history with Reddington.
Yes, sir. I was reassigned from New York. I graduated Quantico last month.
Thank you.
I’m sorry, sir?
Oh. Okay. Uh Um, well, I’ve been with the Bureau for four years. I was the head of the Mobile Emergency Psych Unit in New York. We worked murders, extortion–
Of course. My colleagues call me “sir.” They think I’m a bitch. Like most kids who raised themselves, I can display narcissistic behavior. I can be withdrawn, disconnected. Uh, I have a deep yearning to understand and relate to the criminal mind. I’m board certified in forensic psychology, and yet I operate under the delusion that I can rewrite my past by having kids of my own.
I think that it suggests he was waiting for me.
Because I’m new and he thinks I can be easily manipulated. The man obviously doesn’t know me very well.
What is this place?
So this is a black site?
Well I’m here.
Tell me about Zamani.
Why involve me? I’m nobody. It’s my first day. Nothin’ special about me.
And how do you know this?
And I’m supposed to believe you?
What did you tell him?
How did he know those things? Private things about my family?
We need to contact the SWAT commander at Quantico. Roll a team out to the girl.
No, he’s establishing value.
And five years has gotten you what? You asked me here, you asked my opinion. Here it is. That girl’s gonna get taken.
Excuse me. [ On cell ] Tom. Thank God you picked up.
That helicopter, they flew me to the Assistant Director, put me on a case, and I can’t get away right now.
Can I just have one minute, um –
I’m sorry. I know we had an appointment, but there’s a girl, something happened I- I can’t tell you. It’s classified. This whole day is classified.
No. No. Tom, listen, our family is the only thing that matters, okay? – It’s the only thing that matters.
I am so sorry.
I love you too.  
Guys, with the guns, please. We don’t want to scare the kids.I got this.
Hi, Bethany, don’t be scared. I just need you to come with me, okay? Thank you. 
Your name’s Beth, right?
My name’s Beth, too. I’m Elizabeth. My friends call me Liz, though. You can call me Liz if you want.
Oh, yeah? I bet your daddy has lots of medals. To get a pin like this you gotta be really brave. This can be your special pin, okay? There you go. You like it? [ Beth gives Liza toy elastic bracelet ] Oh You don’t have to –  Thank you so much. This is beautiful. Wow.
Okay, I’ll be careful.
Hey, what’s going on up there?
Do you want to call your daddy?
Okay.
Are you okay?
Okay, baby, this smoke’s gonna hurt us. All right? I need you to put this on for me.
There’s only one. It’s for you, hon. Okay, listen to me. These men are gonna take you.
They’re not gonna hurt you. I’m gonna find you, okay?
Beth, I’m gonna find you.
Where’s the girl? It’s been four hours. Your people haven’t made any demands.
I need your help with Zamani.
There was a fire. I was fourteen.
Not exactly, no.
How on earth – ?
You lost the right to speak about parenthood when you abandoned your wife and daughter on Christmas Eve. The girl.
And how should I look at this?
Your 36-hour timeline would suggest a singular event. Something in D.C. I’m not sure how the girl fits.
Important, well paid. Whatever Zamani’s planning is expensive. Some sort of attack?
Zamani’s sick. CIA says he carries the Nipah virus. Dying makes him dangerous.
Her father, the General, spent time in Bosnia supporting NATO troops in the Bihac Pocket region. Zamani’s home. He bombed a chemical weapons facility, poisoning the village. It’s about his family. They died, Zamani survived. He wants revenge. He hired the Chemist to build a bomb, detonate it in Washington. He’s gonna use Beth to settle the score, deliver the bomb.
Where is this Innkeeper?
What about the bomb?
I gotta get out of here and clear my head. Take a shower, see my husband.
Oh, my– Did they say yes? Oh, baby! How did you do this? Oh, my God, I cannot believe–  We’re gonna have a baby, and this is exac–
Tom?!
Tom, look at me.
[ To Tom ] It’s gonna be okay.
I don’t– Tom!
A bomb. Maybe. We don’t know. We only knew about the girl. The rest is just speculation.
Tom, baby, it’s gonna be okay.
You son of a bitch!
Nothing! I swear! Oh. My God.
It’s gonna be okay.
Tom. Baby. Oh, my God. Baby, keep your eyes open. I’m gonna get help. I’m gonna get help. Don’t fall aslee– You’re gonna be okay! You’re gonna be okay.
Did you send him? Are you the one who did this?
He was in my house! My husband is on a ventilator because Zamani came –
Don’t play stupid. You’re the only thing connecting us. He told me that you’re obsessed with me.
We’re not a team.
I’m not your partner.
I don’t know, he said– he said something about casualties and chemical agents, and he talked about you. He even thanked me for getting rid of the Chemist.
[ Furiously ] Why the hell was he in my house?! Tell me! You know him! Why is my husband dying in a hospital right now?!
Now, you know I just punched a hole in your carotid. Best chance, one minute before you pass out. So here’s how it’s gonna work. You tell me how I find Zamani and make this right, or I let you die right here. Understand?
You know nothing about my husband.
Agent Ressler? I gotta talk to him.
I know. The Chemist isn’t talking, is he?
Red knows Zamani. Just give me five minutes. Thank you…
He’s gone.
Hello?
Where are you? 
He, uh, he asked about the Chemist and about the girl.
Uh, there was blood. There was blood everywhere.
Over here. There was a tattoo.
I know what I saw. This mark, I’ve seen it before. Field trip. DC. Air and Space or the D.C.Zoo? It wasn’t a tattoo. It was a stamp. Zamani’s gonna bomb the D.C. Zoo.
Beth? Hi, honey. Are you hurt?
Are you alone?
There’s less than three minutes. I’ve got to evacuate, call the bomb squad–
Your friend. What friend? 
Did Reddington send you?
I can’t understand what you’re saying. Can you stop the bomb? Can you stop it?
Yeah, baby, we’re gonna be okay. Hey. I was scared when I was your age, too. But I had a secret weapon to keep me safe. My daddy gave it to me. It’s very special. I’ve never shown it to anybody. It’s like magic.
Whenever I’m feeling sad or afraid, I just touch it like this, and it makes me brave. Do you want to see if it can make you brave?
You’re a brave girl.
Wait. Wait! What are you doing?!
That is a chemical weapon!
Red vest, gray sweatshirt! He’s got the bomb!
No.
No.
His name’s Tom Keen. Schoolteacher, 4th grade.
Yes.
Tell me about the train wreck.
My name’s “Liz,” not “Lizzy.” To you, I’m agent Keen. Now, I’ve heard all your demands, but I don’t think you’ve heard mine, so let me tell you how this is gonna work. I ask the questions, you answer them. Screw with me, and I walk. Understood?
They’re never gonna give you immunity. Not a chance.
Tell me about the train wreck.
Everything.
What do you know about the passports?
Nobody.
No.
Before we do this, let me be clear. I’m not here to socialize. I have no interest in having dinner with you, nor do we have the time. We meet your contact, we get the name of the Freelancer’s next victim, and we go. Understood?
So, what does this liaison look like?
I’ll have wine. Chardonnay?
 Oh, this isn’t what I ordered.
Uh–huh?
Where’s your contact?
Why would I do that?
You’re a loner. You keep your distance. You travel freely through foreign lands. You’re rootless. You’re very comfortable here with your glass of Scotch, but you’re just as comfortable sleeping in a cave with rebels or sharing dinner in some hole-in-the-wall noodle shop. Your closest friends are strangers. You understand that tight bonds can make you vulnerable, so you’re careful not to have any. And that’s why you’re so conflicted about me. You need me. And you hate that about yourself, because it makes you vulnerable.♤
Your contact is late.
It’s been 35 minutes.
Why am I so important to you? Did you know my parents? I asked you a question.
Are you gonna keep trying to impress me with your knowledge of French wine, or are you gonna answer my question?
What the hell was that? You sold him out.
I let him go?! Who notified RCMP?!
Floriana Campo. The human–rights activist?
Elizabeth Keen. FBI. We need to have a word with you. We have reason to believe someone’s planning an assassination attempt on your life. Tonight’s fundraiser needs to be canceled.
We can’t guarantee your safety.
We know what they did to your husband, what you’ve gone through. Your work, it’s been an inspiration. I wrote my senior thesis on your time in Kuala Lumpur. I was going through a very bad time. And in some ways, I think you helped me through it.
Uh, Elizabeth. And If all goes well –
Look, we can’t force you to accept our protection, but we need your help to find the man contracted to kill you. To identify him, to capture him, we need you to cooperate – you’re our only link. Will you help us? 
She spent 15 years with the UN, stationed primarily in eastern Europe with small stints in north Africa In 2000, she helped pass the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Since that time, her nonprofit has raised over $35 million in her campaign to eliminate human and sex trafficking around the globe. Three years ago, her husband was murdered by the Eberhardt Cartel.
We’ve changed schedules, travel routes.
I need your help. You said you’ve seen this guy once. We’re compiling photos of the people who are scheduled to attend the event tomorrow, and —
So, you want to go to the party?
No, thank you. Your 7:00?
Oh, yes. I’m fine.
What’s wrong?
Shipment?
Where? There must be something the Bureau can do.
What?
Stop! FBI! – Federal agent! –
Sweep the floor. Lock it down.
Don’t leave your suite.
What? No. How could he?
Why?
Hey! Where’s my agents?! Get out of my way.
You hired The Freelancer.
What are you saying?
You know him?
I need a medic!
Give it to me!
Give it to me now! She’s not breathing!
This will help you breathe.
I don’t believe you.
Good God.
Give me the antidote.
What’s happening?
What would you have done if the antidote had worked on time? It would have exposed you as our informant.
We’ve confirmed that Floriana Campo was running a fortune through the Kowloon Bank. You were right. The woman ran the Eberhardt cartel. Based on the information you gave us, we were able to intercept the shipment and rescue the girls.
I had no idea. I mean, I just I should have known.
Yeah … sorry. I’m just a little distracted.
I know. I’m sorry. I wish I could tell you more. I want to tell you more.
He’s gone. He was killed.
Yes.
That’s Ellie.
Oh, you don’t have to do that.
That’s incredibly cool of you.
I got to run. Ellie, we owe you.
You know I wouldn’t go if I didn’t have to.
Okay. [ Kisses him on cheek ]
Slug and casing from a 9-millimeter. Can you run these and see if they match any crimes in our system? (The Tech takes the bag, nodding yes.)
I’m sorry. You’re decoding C.I.A. messages on behalf of the Chinese?
Do you expect me to believe that – a secret meeting with the mysterious Wujing?
He’s a myth.
What? What cover?
You’re asking me to betray the life of an American agent.
He claims Wujing has hired him to decode a message that the Chinese have intercepted from the C.I.A. He believes that it might contain the identify of another one of our assets in China.
I’m not prepared to do this.
Reservations? You’re asking me to spy on a notorious spy killer while pretending to be an expert in cryptography, which I know nothing about.
I’m sorry.
Okay. Say I do this. What’s in it for me?
If I’m gonna help you, I want something in return.
The truth. Just once. I want to know why you chose me.
If I decode the message, that means the Chinese get it too.
Great plan, except, as I have said, I know nothing about encryption.
A magic box?
How do I get the message out?
No.
And if you’re wrong?
What database is this being run against?
How far down do you think we’re going?
Oh, he was an amazing teacher. I was so sorry to hear that he passed away.
The government’s been experimenting with better factoring algorithms. It’s only a matter of time before RSA’s obsolete.
I’ll just need a few moments to set up my equipment.
No. I can’t.
There’s your next target – kill number five. Henry Cho.
This was sent from a C.I.A.server, delivered to a server at the Nanjing Grand Hotel.
[ To Red ] We have to do something.
We can’t just let them do this.
You hired me to do a job. It’s done. Now let’s get out of here.
I don’t think so.
You didn’t have to kill him.
I held up my end of the deal. Now it’s your turn. You owe me an answer.
Why me?
What does that mean? Did you know my father? Have the two of you met somehow?
You act like we’re the same. You’re wrong. I have a life … people who care about me. But you … this is all you have.
You okay?
Thanks.
Hey.
Great. Let me take this for you. Everyone wanted to be here for Tom.
Hey.
Fine. (to server) Thank you.
It’s okay.
Hey. I forgot my badge, but I got to grab these records.
I’m in a real hurry here. I wonder if I can look while you run me through.
I’ve got court this afternoon. Just going over some notes.
You are aware, then, that I’m due in court in three hours.
Why? What’s happened?
What’s he asking for?
I’ve got a witness testifying today who’s got him cold. Lorca’s not going anywhere.
It’s gonna be okay.
If the juror can’t continue, they’ll bring in an alternate. For now, we’re gonna keep you in a holding area. I’ll take it from here.
I’ll go and find her. I’ll bring her back here.
Stairs! 
I don’t give a rat’s ass. Where are you?
Doing what?
My witness is gone. Lorca’s people contacted you. What did they say, exactly?
A man’s life is at stake!
Fine.
Really?
Right.
It’s so gross.
We were in Boston that weekend. You had that job interview.
Yeah.
You have no idea.
Do I really have tells?
Keen.
What do you want?
I’m at the crime scene. Or what we think is the crime scene.
Not much.
How do you know that?
Chemicals.
Why?
Lorca knows. If not his name, he knows how to make contact.
Because we told them he is.
Once I turn you over to Homeland, it’s beyond my ability to help you!
My name is Elizabeth. I have a name. I’m a person. I have a husband. I want you to know who I am.
Who are you? I deserve that at least, since you’re gonna kill me. I mean, you understand decency, don’t you? At the very least, I should know the name of the person who’s gonna take my life. I know the name they call you out there. It’s disparaging, disrespectful. But it’s not who you are, is it? It’s not how you feel about yourself.
You don’t know?
They call you the Stewmaker because of the chemicals you use to dissolve human bodies.
Is that what you do? Transform energy?
But you do it very differently.
What about family? You seem like a father. You have kids? A son? A son, then. How old is he? How old is your son?
I knew it. A caring father.
No.
It’s my job to read people. And you’re not a killer.
Tell me, how does it work? How do you make them disappear so perfectly?
What did you give me?
Why are you doing this?! You don’t take life. You clean up death.
You know what I think? I think this idea of you vanishing people to aid nature is a lie. I think you’re trying to dissolve something else. Your past, maybe? Whatever the horrible thing was that twisted you up inside and made you into the freak that you are!
You know, I was wrong about you. You’re not perfect.
No, Red. He couldn’t help it.
You’re no better than him.
You’re a monster.
Yeah?
I promise.
Nothing.
I need to ask you about something, and I need you to tell me the truth.
 man was shot and killed in that hotel.
Were you involved?
The murder.
I don’t know anything. You’re hurting me!
I don’t know anything! I swear!
Aah!
Oh, God. I hate you right now.
Stop it, both of you! Ouch!
Why?
You hate doctors.
I thought Jeni was having second thoughts.
That’s That’s great news.
Wait. I’m not invited?
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Mm! 
Cooper told me. Here’s the profile I prepared on him.
Yeah. I also prepared a profile on you. “Uptight, fueled by an inner rage,” “capable of the occasional moment of tenderness, which likely brings on the desire to stay up all night watching Asian porn.”
Huh. How about this? You don’t trust me. You think I’m tainted somehow. Maybe a traitor. You resent the fact that Reddington wants to work directly with me instead of you. Speak of the devil. It’s the devil. [Call from Red.]
What is this place?
Never heard of him.
Please.
What is that?
Why am I here?
They replace trust with fear and the threat of violence.
Cooper’s not gonna sanction a black op against the U.P.S. driver of crime.
Does he have a name?
Skip to the part where you tell me how you expect us to find him.
Where are they making the exchange?
My 1:00? Could be him. Same height, right age.
When it rings, pick it up.
He’s moving.
He’s off.
I think he just made contact.
Just made contact.
You hit?
Cut him off at the next intersection! Do it.
Get your hands up! Put it up now. Put your arm up now.
You’re not telling us everything.
There’s a knife wound in his chest, scars all over his body. You know how he got them?
And the scarring?
Newspaper’s from yesterday. Time stamp on the video file is 4:29 this morning. It’s a proof–of–life video.
We didn’t find a package because there wasn’t one, sir. Soroush was putting up $20 million for this guy. We just stopped him from delivering a ransom payment.
We got a hit when we ran his name and face through the DMV servers. Seth Nelson lives in Maryland with his parents, works tech support for a cable company.
I need to know what you’re not telling me about the Courier.
My gratitude.
The gun that I found in the box is connected to an open homicide.
It’s classified. I can’t read the file.
I know it happened in Boston last year. I think it was a Russian tourist who was murdered Victor Fokin.
Because I was there with him. He supposedly had a job interview, and we made it into a small vacation.
You’re talking about a drug dealer.
All I care about is finding Seth. Call your friend. I want the Courier’s safe-house address.
According to Reddington, the Courier kills anyone who tries to double-cross him. He probably wanted to know where to find them if something went wrong.
I’ve been trying to figure out if there’s anything in this world you care about. How about him? [ Shows him photo of the two boys in front of the trailer ] Care about your little brother, Tommy? We’re bringing him in from Petersburg Federal Prison right now. Anything you want me to tell him? 
Tell me about your brother. Who he works with, his contacts. Tell me about the people in his life.
There’s you. Tried to help you break out, didn’t he? From what I understand, he’d do anything for his little brother.
A 26-year-old MIT grad.
I know his condition prevents him from feel–
She doesn’t have to. She’s still expecting her money. We send someone in as the Courier, tell her the exchange was a setup, the deal’s off, she can pick up Seth where she dropped him off.
Oh, my God. Tom. Oh, God. He’s gonna kill me. [ She picks up ] I’m so sorry.
I can’t do this right now.
I promise we’ll talk as long as you like, but later.
All teams stand by. Our man is entering the building.
[Over Phone] You need to make an example here. You have to hurt him. That’s what the Courier would do.
You know he can hear you, right?
Asset compromised. Hit the building.
He does feel pain. He’s got a brother serving. The one thing in the world he cares about. Offer to reduce or commute his sentence in exchange for telling us Seth’s location The life of a stranger for the life of his brother.
We think he used one of the objects hidden inside him. He was carrying around his own escape package.
According to his brother, Woodbridge is where he grew up.
How?
The Courier took the proof-of-life video at 4:29 a.m Just under 30 minutes later. Assume he spent 20 minutes minimum with Seth at the site. That would give him 10 minutes of drive time from the rest stop, so he has to be somewhere in this radius.
The only place with road access is here at this open area. He has to be here.
You want Seth for your own reasons.
What?
Seth. We called your parents. They’re gonna meet you at the hospital.
Don’t even think about it.
That story you told Dechambou about your job being the only thing left that was –
Thank you.
I don’t even know why I’m here.
Sit down. We need to talk.
Yes! I found it!
When I was cleaning up your blood.
What am I not telling you?!
Do you really expect me to believe that you’ve never seen any of this before?
Are you serious about all this? Is this you?
This It’s a picture of you at the Angel Station Hotel in Boston.
There was a murder there that matches this gun. An agent named Victor Fokin, a Russian agent who was in the process of defecting when he was killed before he could say anything.
That’s enough. Some of the dates on these passports…
No. …March 12, 2011. Your bachelor party. In Las Vegas. I’ve never seen pictures.
You can get to Paris and back in 19.
It’s not my picture on these passports.
Fine.
You think I’m kidding?
Agent Keen, 1212–654 White Bear. I need clearance for an incoming client.
Thomas Vincent Keen. My husband.
I don’t work at the FBI.
This is where I work, Tom.
Wait.
[ Sighs ] You’re gonna be okay. Just tell them what happened. Tell the truth.
Where are they taking him?
The gun, the money, and passports were in my house. A hatch in the floor.
Yes.
Tom is my husband. I brought him here, to you, for help, to find answers. I want to know who killed that FSB agent as much or more than you do. If we can solve that murder –
What? No. Tom is here.
I thought we were here to talk about Tom.
I don’t know who that is.
According to Reddington, her real name is Gina Zanetakos. Nearly a year ago, she reached out to him as Shubie Hartwell. She wanted Red to broker a deal to assassinate a supreme court judge who was the swing vote in a case that could have cost her corporate clients billions.
Uh, I feel like I’ve seen her before.
Meera, it’s Liz. Give me a call as soon as you speak with the headmaster. I’d like to know how things are going.
And why is that?
Call an ambulance.
Gina?
Ressler? Why do you have her phone? Wh– Did you find her? Did you stop her?
But what’s the target? 
We believe Zanetakos is planning to detonate a dirty bomb somewhere in the central time zone of the United States.
Somebody hired this woman. She killed a man today, Nadeem Idris. He was an attaché at the Turkish Embassy. Looks like they were having an affair. We suspect it was a means to an end.
We have looked through all of Zanetakos’ phone messages, all her records. There wasn’t a single message from Tom.
There’s nothing between them. My husband is innocent.
The picture. [ Whispers to herself then turns and leaves ]
Ressler. Victor Fokin, the FSB agent. She was watching him. So she could kill him, not Tom. She’s an assassin.
I needed you to be wrong about him.
And you need me because you need Red to find this guy.
Zanetakos made a wire payment to him a few weeks ago.
Can you help me find him? 
Kill her? I want to talk to her.
Don’t tell me to calm down!
That woman was the link! She was the only proof that my husband is innocent! And now she’s what? Dying? Lying unconscious in some hospital?
Have we forgotten that there’s a bomb out there?
We have less than four hours.
What, is Zanetakos gonna come out of surgery by then? Because that was the only lead we have!
[ Sighs ] The bomb –  What do you know?
Well, do you know why Zanetakos killed Nadeem Idris in that hotel or how the Hanar Group is connected, –  who their enemies are?
The investors.
What do you mean, the investors?
What division?
New Orleans – What do you know about it?
You were on the phone. That guy –  Someone was getting married. You were talking. Something about New Orleans and the ports.
You told the man on the phone your payment was diverted. Why?
The Hanar Group hired Zanetakos.
Where was your payment diverted from?
That’s the target. New Orleans and Houston are the two biggest ports in the Gulf. If Houston were to close because of radioactive contamination, all traffic would have to be diverted to New Orleans. Hanar’s profits would soar. They’d be the only game in the Gulf.
[ Dialing ] The port of Houston. You need to halt all cargo traffic headed there right now. That’s the destination. The Hanar Group hired Zanetakos to bomb the port.
It could be anywhere.
We’re missing something. The Hanar Group. They hire Zanetakos. She contracted Ruddiger to build a bomb. But something’s missing.
What ships have been in or out of here in the last week from Turkey?
Because it’s illegal to search diplomatic cargo. With his help, Zanetakos was able to get the car in without inspection.
Check the manifests for all incoming ships for any items signed by Nadeem Idris.
We’ve only got 10 minutes.
What if we put it in the water? The radiation can be contained underwater.
It’ll work.
Do you know Tom Keen? We found this picture of him in your apartment.
[ Sighs ] Tom?
You and I –  We’re done.
Yeah. Zanetakos confessed.
The passports? Forged. The money in the box? Traced to an offshore account of yours.♤
The truth is that you’re a sick, twisted man. This, your obsession with me – You put Tom’s picture in Zanetakos’ apartment.
You hired her to kill Victor Fokin. You set my husband up by having your errand boy lure him to Boston.
I don’t understand why you would do this, any of it! Go to hell.
[ Holding up pain samples ] Café au lait unless you like the dark nut better. But don’t decide yet.
We’re remodeling.
Well, the guy at the hardware store said to hang the samples in the morning so that you can see what they look like throughout the day. What do you think?
Grandma’s Pumpkins?
I know it’s ridiculous. [ Hugs him, giggling; climbs on his back ] Oh, I’m just so sick of this room.
It’s not the room. It’s just that someone invaded our lives, our house. They put that stupid box in the floor.
They made me believe you were a monster. [ She hops off his back ] I doubted you. I doubted us.
– to move?
[Phone call] Keen.
Babe, can you turn the TV on?
Which channel?
What do we got?
How many dead?
He’s not carrying the briefcase. He left it on the train.
Central Intelligence or National Security?
What you find out?
So, you think this was homegrown?
This is Special Agent Keen.
You know, I don’t have time for this.
You know, as much as I love our little talks, you’re holding up a line for people that might have actual information.
Okay. Who is he?
What do you mean, “was”?
Betraying your country and auctioning off its secrets.
So, what’s changed?
That was the cause of death?
Oh, I’ve never heard of it.
No.
Children?
Our suspect has a background in biological and chemical warfare. Is it possible that he weaponized this disease and somehow modified it to make it more lethal?
And what makes you think he knows how to find Barnes?
I’m sorry. All my tropical wear’s in the wash.
There is no “our flight.”
Actually, I was able to track down. Barnes’ old research partner, so I’m hoping she can fill in some of the missing pieces.
That would imply I care enough to be angry.
Tom teaches 4th grade. He’s overworked and underpaid and still wakes up every morning with a smile on his face. You know why? Because he knows nothing of the terrible world you and I live in. End of story.
Mrs. Forrester? Special Agents Keen and Ressler. We’d like to talk to you about Frederick Barnes.
Were you aware of any problems Barnes may have been having at work or in his personal life?
Do you have any contact info for Barnes? Even an old phone number could help.
I need to ask you a personal question about your son. Does he have Kurz disease?
Because I just saw dozens of corpses infected with a weaponized variant of the disease. Barnes released it on the red line this morning. He killed 37 people, including a 9–year–old child. And I have a hard time believing the coincidence that your son is infected with the same disease your former research partner is now using to commit mass murder. So, if there’s something you’re holding back, now would be a good time to re–evaluate that decision.
Does your husband know this?
Does Frederick know he’s Ethan’s real father?
Why?
That’s why Barnes is killing. He wants to infect enough people with Kurz disease that it gets on the public’s radar.
Because then it can’t be ignored anymore. The more people that die, the more attention the disease gets.
What do you need?
Red got us a 20 on Barnes.
The courthouse in Arlington. We’re on our way in now.
FBI!
Stop! FBI! 
Out! Out of the way! Move! Freeze! I’m only gonna say this once: drop the gun.
And you will be dead one second after. You don’t have to do this!  All right! All right!
Let him go.
How bad?
And your survivor?
What have you got?
I’m not sure I follow.
Of course. Why?
It was a judgment call. Barnes was going to kill that officer.
I am fully aware of our field regulations.
What does that mean?
You mind telling me what the hell that was?
Why would you do that?
You would’ve taken the shot? Is that it?  It’s easy to make the tough call after the fact, isn’t it?
And that hostage would be dead.
That’s a man’s life you’re talking about.
Barnes got away, and the trail’s dried up.
Do you know how to find him?
Don’t hang up.
The reason Barnes is still out there is because I let him slip away. And it’s only a matter of time before he kills again. So, please, I need your help.
I need your help.
Which means what?
Uh, no.
Why would he?
Maybe we beat him to it.
We have reason to believe Ms. Rubin is in danger.
Who’s had access to this room?
Is she okay?
What is that?
You were right about Barnes. They weren’t just attacks. They were experiments. He was searching for someone with a natural immunity for Kurz disease.
That’s why she survived the attack. Her test results just came back. She has zero sign of infection.
 He’s going for the boy.
[ Trying to reach Mrs Forrester ] Come on. Come on.
Mrs. Forrester, this is Special Agent Keen. I need you to listen to me very carefully. Is your son, Ethan, with you?
Take your son and get out of your house immediately. We have reason to believe that Frederick Barnes is on his way. I need you to get Ethan to a safe place.
[ On Phone ] Anne! Anne, are you there?
[ On phone ] Mrs. Forrester?
Step away from him!
I know what you think you have in that needle.
Your cure is experimental. It could just as easily kill him.
You don’t know that.
There’s no universe in which I let you stick that thing in his neck.
Ethan? Ethan? 
What are you doing here?
Anxiety.
Tell that to the families of the people he murdered.
Is that meant to be directed at me?
Is that how you somehow justify your actions, by some misguided notion of protecting me? Red: From whom?
My husband, I suppose. I don’t need your protection.
But I do need you to do this job. I’ve accepted that. And believe it or not, I appreciate what you do for the bureau. And at work, you and I are partners. But that’s where this relationship needs to end at work. I don’t want you in my personal life. I don’t know how to make that clear.
You have a deal with the government. You have a tracking device in your neck. You don’t believe Raymond Reddington could cease to exist in 60 seconds?
You’re offering to walk away?
Yeah, I’m done.
I keep going over that moment in my head, wondering what would’ve happened if I’d just let him go through with it. Given what we know, that drug was probably the real thing.
Because you were right. Barnes needed to be stopped. And if the cure’s genuine, it’ll be vetted through the proper channels.
Then I guess that’s just what happens.
What is this?
Clearly.
You have no idea.
Did you really get rid of all our stuff?
What?
Oh, yeah, the lamp.
Yeah. That’s all we had.
Hey, what are you still doing here?
It’s my dad…
…Is everything okay?
How you feeling?
Something’s wrong.
You’re in the hospital? I’m coming.
When are these tests happening?
No jokes. If this is serious, I want to be there.
Don’t say that just ’cause you don’t want to bother me. You’re my dad. You’re allowed to bother me.
Okay. Leave your phone on and call me as soon as it’s done, okay?
Dad, I love you.
Reddington believes General Ludd is behind the attack. They take their name from the leader of a 19th-century group called the luddites, a militant wing of a popular struggle against early industrial capitalism.
This group is incredibly well-educated. They’re as disciplined as any terrorist cell. Identifying the members has been impossible.
Better. Says he can identify the group’s founder, Nathaniel Wolff. Says he’s the man ultimately responsible for taking down that plane. This is the only known image of him that we have.
That’s Arthur Denning? I just got a company I.D. on Roger Gard. Aram, can you pull up that picture?
[ Leaving a message for her father ] Hey. I know you don’t want to call me because you don’t want to freak me out, but F.Y.I., not calling me freaks me out, so call me. Uh, I– I just want to know about the tests. I love you.
I’m sorry. What?
We went to the apartment, looking for the real identity of the man posing as Denning and Gard. The one thing we knew going in was that the man we were looking for was not Nathaniel Wolff. We were wrong. Reddington was right.
He changed his face.
You have a suburban housewife printing fake money out of her garage.
I’ve been calling your people all morning. Luli didn’t pick up.
Well, then you should have dug that chip out of your damn neck.
We searched the home address listed for both suspects and were able to pull some prints. They belong to Nathaniel Wolff.
Someone changed his face.
Excuse me?
My father’s fine. He’s just … Who the hell told you that?
I am not doing this – playing this game, guessing what you know or how you know it.
What?
You want me to protect some plastic surgeon who might be linked to a terrorist organization? Red: Yes.
Trust me, it’s not by choice.
Did you hear me? I said I need his new name. Give it to me, or I’ll have the Miami field office tear your practice apart faster than you can say “tummy tuck.”
You said this guy was solid.
We believe Wolff is now using the name Bradley Holland, a pilot for Innova Air.
Anonymity is a cornerstone of this group’s decentralized command structure. Wolff has given up his identity for this cause. Wall Street destroyed the airline that Wolff’s father devoted his life to. So Wolff is now using the airlines in his efforts to destroy Wall Street.
He’s gonna bring down another plane.
Tom.
I’m sorry. Now’s not a good time.
Aunt June gets indigestion and thinks she’s having a stroke.
What? No, he was just going in for a few tests.
I can’t. I– Oh, my God. I got to call him.
So surgery for what? Have you talked to his oncologist?
Sir? I have a family emergency. My father’s sick. I need to catch a flight.
I know the timing is terrible –
What? Why?
He created entire lives. As if they were real people.
Daddy, thank God. I was so worried. What’s going on? Tom just spoke with Aunt June.
Tom said you’re in surgery?
But obviously they think they can do something. They think –
I’m on my way, as soon as I can get on a plane. You’re gonna be fine, daddy. I know that.
I love you.
Keen.
Not a good time.
With the case?
All planes are grounded.
I can’t talk right now.
This was never about the money. Wolff’s people hit that truck for something far more valuable than the cash.
That’s not exactly true.
You said you could still fly?
Wolff wanted us to ground those planes so he could steal the blueprints for the new hundred-dollar bill. He’s escaping by plane. Nobody’s watching the sky.
So if you were him, where would you fly from?
Wall Street.
Thank you.
I should’ve known when you agreed to help us catch Wolff that you would take something for yourself. We didn’t think he could access the safe on the truck, but he did. And he swapped the original drive for a counterfeit, and when we arrested him, he didn’t have it.
I just can’t believe he’s gone. I’m never gonna hear him say my name. Or smell that old aftershave. It’s different with you because you you can trace your life up to this moment, you know?
You have reliable records and –
Yeah.
It’s all right.
[ Tries intercom ] Hello? 
[ Tries intercom again ] Hello? Hello?!
Hatchling–5591–abstract.
I’m here, sir.
I’m already inside.
Neither.
Barricaded inside the armory.
[ To herself, in a whisper ] Okay, let’s go. Oh, calm, calm, calm. Come on, come on, come on. Use your training. Use your training. Be fluid. Be fluid.
Lower your gun to your side. Now reach across your body with your right hand and remove your tactical belt. Any sudden or aggressive movements, and I will kill you.
That’s good. [ She knocks him out ]
What the hell are you doing here?
I snuck in. What are you doing?
Where is everyone?
Where’s Red and Ressler?
Any idea who hit this facility?
How long before you can restore the telecom?
How?
Where would they place it?
Could you reset the telecom if the jammers were disabled?
Good. You got a weapon?
‘Cause we’re gonna go find those jammers.
Yes. You and I in the plural.
We are the cavalry. Give me your gun.
Pretend they’re paper.
How many of these things would they need to scramble the telecom signal?
Cellular?
It’s not enough. This will be faster if we split up.
Where is everyone?
We’re gonna go find those jammers.
We need to move now! Aram! Listen to me. We need to move now!
Please.
[ To Garrick ] In about five minutes, an FBI assault will retake the building. Get out now. You might survive.
Tom!
Tom, listen to me! Call the FBI!
[ Jumps into random car and orders driver: ] FBI! Follow that ambulance! Drive! Now! Give me your phone! Give it to me!
Aram!
I’m in pursuit, but I’ve lost visual! I’m headed west on Constitution.
They’re trying to pull his chip.
Aram, where are they?
Yeah, this is the right location.
No, he’s gone. We lost Reddington.
Aram, wait. You can’t –
Listen to me – Red’s alive.
Mm-hmm?
Closed-circuit feeds from the block around the building from when Reddington came in, going back an hour.
Thank you.
He’s in surgery. They’re hoping they can save his leg. Aram – we got to keep this between us. We don’t know who we can trust.
Emissary Hotel.
Hi. Mr. Kaplan, please.
This – ? Uh, yes, I suppose. Goodbye.
Yeah, I–
I know.
I’m okay.
Don’t.
Go?
Someday. I got caught up in the middle of something. I have to take this. [ On phone ] Aram, what do you have for me?
Okay, I’ll look through them right now.
Damn it. How did Garrick know he was in the post office?
You found the mole?
Aram, the lead?
All from the same burner?
What? [ Liz looks outside. The address is across the street ] I’ll call you right back.
Mr. Kaplan?
Red. [ Liz lets Mr Kaplan in ] You? You’re Mr. Kaplan?
Nobody.
No.
I don’t know. Every time Reddington came to the post office, a call was made to this address, I assume to him.
When he got word that Red was at the post office, he must have called Garrick to trigger the hit.
“Handle”?
Okay, wait. I can’t do this. I’m a federal agent.
What database?
What about the GPS data?  If he works for the man holding Red, then maybe he’s been there before.
Why?
Calling it in. We need backup.
This wasn’t my operation. Fowler may have shut us down, but did you really think Reddington’s people weren’t gonna try to find him themselves?
The only reason you’re standing here is because they trust me enough to involve me.
Some kind of operations outpost three miles from the post office. Seems to be manned by the same people who infiltrated our facility and kidnapped Reddington. That doesn’t concern you?
At least six. It was an outpost. Professionals. These people were highly trained. Like Garrick. What’s all this?
All these names are redacted.
You really think that Garrick had someone on the inside?
Is he still in surgery?
[ Reading ] Hollins Ferry Road. I know that address. It says DCM What does that mean?
Is that a church?
I’m gonna need satellite access to this address.
Because I think this might be where they’re holding Reddington.
Yeah. Why?
I think we found Reddington.
A church in Baltimore –  A decommissioned black site.
It makes sense. It’s the last place we would think of. And if he knew about this site, he’d know about others.
He was here.
I’m sorry.
They’re gone.
Hello?
Where are you?
Dembe’s looking for you. He says it’s urgent.
The task force, Cooper – They’re searching for you. What should I tell them?
Wait. One question, please. It’s about my father. Growing up, Sam, – He raised me like his own. He was my whole world. But he wasn’t my father.
Are you my father?♤
Everyone at the post office is under mandatory surveillance till they identify the leak.
They are.
So do I. But not in Nebraska.
Hang on. You’re leaving?
We need to talk about us, but – [Phone call] My God.
Same surgical precision, same call to 911. This is the guy.
I rode lead on this case.
This case is important to me. It’s personal. If it’s personal to me, it’s personal to Reddington. He may reach out, try to help make this his case.
No.
No.
As part of an investigation.
You can look into that. All the information is here.
Yes.
I was on my way here. I was late.
Seven so far. All different ages, incomes. He always acted unpredictably. We could never figure out his trigger, only that he’s trying to make a statement.
He never kills his victims. He always calls 911, allows first responders a chance to save their lives. That’s why the papers call him The Good Samaritan.
That’s what we need you to confirm for us, sir. I’m sorry.
Hello?
Where are you?
The Good Samaritan.
They’re going to find you.
One of the earliest victims – she died in my arms. There was nothing I could do to stop it.
Serial killers escalate. This one doesn’t. The victims and methods vary. I could never see the pattern the profile. Still can’t.
Wait.
[ On phone ] I think I’ve got something.
Yes. He called.
Not yet. We talked about the case.
I will, but something he said about the case –  We’ve been focused on the killer. We should be focused on the victims. The most recent victim’s son, Michael, broke his collarbone.
Normally, the father would be the prime suspect, but that doesn’t fit. I mean, even if he wanted to hurt her for abusing their son, what about the other victims?  Unless it’s the same motive.
Every one of The Good Samaritan’s victims had a family member with identical injuries – fractured skulls, broken bones, torn retinas. All of them either the victim’s spouse or child. All of them classic signs of physical abuse.
How else do you explain this?
Yes, there is. Nurse Karl Hoffman. [ AKA “Victor”] He was on call every time one of the family members was brought into the ER. He’s a locum tenens. He fills in for short–staffed hospitals, like a substitute teacher.
Hoffman’s not here. He wrapped up his shift at 4:00. What did you find on your end?
I already pulled the medical records of all the patients he saw on his last shift.
I sure as hell hope not.
Yeah, specifically ones who came in with broken bones.
Okay.
Melissa, I need to ask you a difficult question. Has your husband been abusing you?
I’m aware of your visit to the ER. You’ve been interviewed by a caseworker in the past.
Did he seem to be in any kind of distress?
[ shows photo ]  Is this the man he was with?
Thank you. ⋘⋙ He’s taking back control in the place where it was taken away from him – his childhood home.
Step away from him!
That may be, but killing him isn’t gonna solve anything.
Drop the hammer! One more body isn’t gonna make a difference.
Mrs. Wilkinson, I’m gonna need to speak with your husband alone for a moment.
Actually, wait. Metro PD is looking into charges against you, but without Melissa’s cooperation, I don’t know what will stick. What I do know is this – if you ever touch her again, if you so much as look at her sideways, I will find you. And I will do to you myself what I probably should have let Karl Hoffman do to you in that garage. Do you understand? 
Thank you for coming back. I don’t want to fight, Tom. Let’s just talk.
What the hell are you doing here?
Does this mean you’re back?
What does that mean?
Someone on the inside.
Therefore, we’re back where we began.
Well, then. Welcome back. Where have you been, anyway?
Did you bring me anything?
Someone on the inside.
What are you doing here? Did you bring me anything?
The mob informant?
And this blacklister –  does he have a name?
Why do they call him the Alchemist?
He hasn’t given me one, sir.
He’ll only meet off–site. He doesn’t think the mole hunt ends with Newton Phillips. Reddington believes there’s someone on the inside.
I think I was followed.
Is this really necessary?
You were wrong about Madrczyk. You said the Alchemist was hired to protect him. Now he’s dead.
No, he’s dead.
It’s been confirmed by the lab– DNA tests. Dental prints.
Y–you can’t change DNA.
Wait. Madrczyk tried to hire you?
Are you telling me that you know where he wanted to flee?
You have eyes on the target?
Tassels? Is that her dog?
Any sign of the wife?
It’s him. Everyone in position.
Hey. You’re home. How was the job interview?
My dad?
Thank you.
I think about it all the time.
I know. I would quit my job if I could –  I know you don’t believe that.
I can do that. I promise.
I know. It showed up on our Netflix queue.
I will do anything to make this easier.
Anything.
Please tell me she’s not.
We got the autopsy results back for the male victim on the plane. The dental plates pulled by the ME were within the margin of error– not perfect, but close enough to determine a match. Then, when they inspected the teeth themselves, they found they’d been altered.
His teeth had been surgically replaced, some of them filed, modified.
Somehow, the Alchemist got Madrczyk’s DNA into the body of this john doe.
How does he do it?
So this isn’t just evidence tampering. This is genetic manipulation.
April 2009 – an $8 billion Ponzi scheme wipes out the savings of every account holder at Chariton National. December 2011– seven people are found dead in a diner, victims of a mob hit. Two months later, the Bronx DA files charges on behalf of 24 teenage boys who claimed they were molested at church. There are more, and in each of these cases, investigators found perpetrators of the incidents dead. According to Reddington, they’re not.
How did you identify her?
Aram, Sarah Jenkins– who was she online with?
Sarah Jenkins was using an online–dating site. That’s how we think the Alchemist found her. Gave him everything he needed to know to double her as Catherine Madrczyk.
No. Uh, an alias. But we got a photo. [ It’s Trettel. Ressler immediately turns and runs ]
Ressler.
Well, when’s the last time you saw him?
Your daughter– she’s diabetic?
How much does she know about her father?
So you’re saying you’ve had contact with him?
What lab? 
Whose garbage are you combing through now?
This is about the incursion.
When you called, you said something about numbers. We found this in the car rented by the Alchemist. Forensics ran an analysis on the paper. It traced to a manufacturer in Albany. They produce stock for business forms. One client stood out– bank Credit Suisse Zurich. We think this is a sequence of numbers associated with a bank account, – maybe one used to pay the Alchemist.
He’s, um – a scientist, an expert in DNA.
He’s nobody. He’s a lab rat. [ Red nods slightly ] He’s a lab rat.
Tassels is gonna have to wait. I think I figured this out. Come here. Take a look at this. Trettel’s wife told me he had this lab in the basement, so it got me thinking. What if that number we found in the car was from a lab, like, a piece of equipment, a model number, or–
[ Guesses ] Squash?
Carrot.
I just can’t take time off my work right now.
You made it sound like it was all my decision.
What? No! We talked about this!
Liz.
I’m sorry you had to hear all that.
Keen. Uh, yeah. I’ll be right there. [ Liz leaves ]
He knows we’re onto him.
Oh, my God. His family.
No, I’m sorry. I–I got in late last night. I didn’t want to wake you. Look, about last night– I totally overreacted. I get that you don’t understand my decision, and I know that’s hard. We should talk about that. I want to hear what you have to say. Let’s carve out some time just for us tonight.
What if I countered with dinner at home? I’ll cook.
Okay, compromise– you cook. I’ll grab dessert?  Please, Tom, let me make this right.
Great. Love you.
The hard drives we found at Trettel’s lab– where are we on the data recovery?
There are multiple case files here– photos of the victims while they were sedated, genetic breakdowns, medical and dental records– probably all from old clients.
Molly and Annie Trettel are alive. The victims at the Trettel house– I want autopsies done immediately. I’m not interested in cause of death. I want bone marrow drawn, tissue samples pulled.
Seven.
Chinese takeout. Can we come back to this later? I need your help. I think Eric Trettel abducted his family.
Two bodies at the wife’s house– a woman and a girl– doubles for his family. Trettel– he’s a cipher, closed off from the world, shut away in his lab. But now he’s on the run. He must be leaving some kind of trail– bank records, uh, wiring money to his new identity.
The wife– she’s a nurse, single mom. The daughter– she’s sick. Diabetic.
Annie Trettel has an insulin pump. Pull her medical records. I want the make and model.
Locate her using the insulin pump.
Absolutely not. The suspect has information we need.
I need to talk to him.
I said I need to talk to him.
Hello?! Eric?! My name is Elizabeth Keen. I’m an agent with the FBI.
I’m unarmed! I just want to talk!
You injured?!
Okay, Eric, that’s good! We’ll talk later! But right now, your daughter needs help! You need to open that door.
I can’t authorize that! But I can help save your daughter’s life. You’re in control here, Eric. Annie’s life is in your hands.
[ Calls Tom ] Please tell me you didn’t cook.
So it is what it is.
How about I pick up some Chinese?
Good luck with Audrey.
Are you sure about that?
Yes. And you were right about the people he helped disappear. Some of them we don’t even know. Cooper thought you might be able to –
You didn’t even look at it.
That’s what this was about– sending us to find the Alchemist for you so you could have that list.♤ Who is it that you’re looking for?
I’m in love with his little nose.
Oh, it’s his face, and I’m in love with him. Oh, my God. It just got real.
I think we are. [ Inhales sharply ] Are you a little freaked out?
Yeah. Yeah. Right. [ Inhales sharply ] You figure out how to use the stroller and the car seat, the base thingy?
You know, um I’ve decided I want to stay home for a little while, spend some time with the baby and –
This is more important.
Adoption? You want me to believe this is a coincidence? Tom and I are adopting a baby, and you serve up an adoption agency?
Who is he really?
I don’t know. Our source says he may have been abducted.
[ Listening from across street ] He’s gonna spook him.
Okay.
[ Flashes badge ] Theodore Caldwell?
FBI. We need to talk.
We know about the abduction. You can do the right thing here.
You can help us. You can help us. Tell us about the agency. –
– Help us find the real parents.
: We’re launching a wider investigation. Until we’re done, you’re out of the adoption business.
Twenty-seven files. That’s 27 adoptions brokered in the last 3 years alone.
That’s a lot, especially when you’re adopting out infants, and that’s almost never done internationally. But there’s the thing. I’ve gone through every case file. I can’t authenticate a single adoption. One child was supposedly born to a birth mother in Lithuania, but I can’t find any record of the birth.
A lot of their missing-persons files have DNA on record. We should coordinate DNA panels on all the kids.
Sir? I wanted to talk with you about something. It’s a personal matter.
It can wait.
The FBI is looking into the Cyprus Agency. There have been some allegations.
Here, open up. I promise this won’t hurt.
I think this will be my last case for awhile. I’m gonna spend some time at home, be with the baby.
We compared the DNA to every known sample on file for missing or abducted kids – not a single hit. The Cyprus Agency delivered 27 children, all unaccounted for. Nobody’s ever reported them missing.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Who wouldn’t report a missing child…?
There isn’t.
We get a hit?
The mothers. Let me guess. They’re in prison.
Missing?
Five women– all attractive, smart, in their early 20s.
Four of the five disappeared without a trace. Allison Hayes – she was a physics student at BU. She went to class one Monday morning and vanished.The police reports are almost identical. These were clean grabs, no witnesses.
Kate Ellison was taken three years ago. Wait. That can’t be right. According to the DNA test, Kate’s the mother of two children delivered by the Cyprus Agency. They’re 1 and 2 years old.
She didn’t only give birth. She got pregnant after she was taken.
Charlotte Patterson – in her second year at Georgetown. You think she could be the agency’s next target?
[ On phone ] Mandell parking garage, shots fired! There’s a kidnapped suspect in a blue van! Virginia plate 8-1-Sam-Echo-Michael-3-6. [ To Ressler ] You okay? 
Charlotte Patterson never made it home from class. She was definitely inside that van.
Waiting on documents from overseas. And the files we seized at the agency have Caldwell’s name all over them. But there’s no paper trail proving Mallory or anyone else knew what was going on.
Nothing good. Kate Ellison had blond hair and blue eyes. She dies, and a day or two later, Charlotte Patterson gets taken.
What would cause that?
If she was shot, maybe she was trying to escape.
Thank you. [ Cellphone vibrating, walks away a bit to take call ]
Aram, what do you have?
Oh, let me guess. He never went.
[ To Ressler ] We’ve got something on Mallory. Aram, send us the Lassiters’ address.
“Now”? Mrs. Lassiter, do you know this man?
So you adopted him.
I’m so sorry. That must have been very difficult.
What the hell is this place?
What are we doing here? I told you– I need help tracking hydroxipam. There’s no federal prescription database. Can’t subpoena every pharmacy on the East Coast.
– When was this?
Thank you.
What’s this code here?
FBI. We need to talk with Dr. Gideon Hadley.
Great. In the meantime, I think we’ll give ourselves a tour of the facility.
I’m okay. Call it in. [ She checks the woman Mallory had thrown on her ]
Except Kate Ellison.
We found Kate Ellison. [ The body found by the dog in the park ] And I’m guessing that’s not the only body we’ll find before this is done. Is it Michael? We know who you are. Michael Shaw adopted at 7 by Charles and Jill Lassiter and returned to foster care. Owen Mallory has no record, but Michael Shaw– he’s quite a con man, isn’t he?
You must have felt so rejected, being removed–
I met the Lassiters. Is that why you did this? To get back at them?
And you and your employees get rich?
What does that mean?
Your legacy. You’re the father. The children brokered by the Cyprus Agency are yours. Why? Mallory/Shaw: Well, I was damaged goods, wasn’t I? Not fit to survive in their privileged world. Well, I am surviving. Now part of me is thriving in every home that has my child.
I can’t do it.
You’re not ready. We’re not ready.
No.
Tom it’s us. [ Voice breaking ] It’s us. I don’t know what’s wrong. I don’t understand it, but something’s not right. I can’t have a baby right now.
Honey, you can’t tell me that there’s not one shred of doubt, one shred that wonders if this is broken.
I’m gonna spend some time at home, be with the baby.
I can’t do it. You’re not ready.
Did you tell him?
I thought he’d ask.
I know this is hard.
I know. I’m sorry.
That’s great.
We should, um, get them something. Have them over for dinner? Wait. Tom, don’t just walk away while we’re talking! 
That’s considered a masterpiece?
Why did you buy it?
I thought you lived here.
No.
Madeline Pratt? Madeline Pratt–
And now you want something of hers and you expect the FBI to help you get it.
What did she take from you?
Madeline Pratt. How do we find her?
To steal what? …
Why is that relevant today?
You said our house wasn’t clean. Is it?
No, sir.
I don’t have a criminal record.
Yes. I believe my work speaks for itself. Sir, I can do this.
We met in high school. We grifted. Small jobs really, just whatever we had to do to pay the rent.
I was 17. There was a drugstore. Thursday night. They made bank deposits on Friday. I was the lookout. The night manager came back. He forgot his glasses. I gave the signal, but nothing. I’d convinced myself that Frank was the only thing I had in the world, so the night manager was an easy decision.
I seduced him into the alley.
I played him for a little bit, then I kissed him off, told him he’d get more next week. And Frank and I went away.
I didn’t come here to audition.
I don’t want the job. Call somebody who does. [ Tosses Madeline her phone ]
How long will it take to breach?
What about physical security?
How do I get in?
I know someone who can clone his badge before Marwan can return to the embassy.
You good?
It’s Madeline Pratt’s SIM card. I swiped it when I palmed her phone. If I’m gonna do this, I want to know who she talks to and why.
How will you return his badge?
How long you need?
I need the badge now.
Oh.
Yes.
Brian and Katie are having a kid. It’s hard.
[Laughs] Zip me up.
Um, Orlando’s landlocked. I’m pretty sure there aren’t any beaches.
I would love that.
We could use a vacation.
Why is that a problem?
What? You said her profile was too high and she wasn’t going.
Why would she hire us to steal the Effigy when she’s obviously planning on stealing it herself?
What are you wearing?
You can’t get into that embassy.
You act like this is a joke. There’s a digital net over the embassy. Aram can’t access the surveillance feeds. I’m going onto foreign soil to steal a priceless artifact with no backup.
There’s Madeline. Think she beat us to it?
How did you know about Omaha?
You’re the one who brought it up.
I made it up.
Okay, I’m gonna need a distraction.
What the hell was that?
Where’s Pratt?
And the effigy?
He told me he was going to try and locate Pratt.
She knew where the effigy was the entire time, and she used us to get it. She got me to set off the alarm, and she used Reddington’s notoriety get the Syrians to believe that he took it.
And he’s connected how?
Hey.
Tom.
There’s nothing I can do.
What do you want me to say?
Tonight? What? Wait.
That is the last thing I want.
I hate this job.
How do you know Madeline Pratt?
He stole it from the British Museum.
Then why put it up for auction?
What do you mean?
They’re nuclear bombs. Hidden all across the country.
You taking off already?
I think he’s gonna leave me.
No. Go.
You have dinner.
What about it?
Red: Yeah, well, two days ago, he was found wandering on a road in Pennsylvania. Nobody knows where he’s been.
Was he in hiding?
The Judge?
And we have The Judge.
What kind of plea?
Yes, but not by Reynoso. He thinks it might’ve been payback for a different case Hastings prosecuted. Aram? [ Aram pulls up file ] Leonard Debs – sentenced to 14 years for armed robbery when he was 28.
A witness allegedly came forward at the time saying Debs wasn’t at the scene. Hastings never told the defense.
And Reddington says there have been others. A New York homicide detective, an appellate court judge, two prosecutors all missing and presumed dead, all involved in cases in which some impropriety was alleged, which made them targets for The Judge.
We believe that the appeals are being processed through a book depository run by a prison–literacy project.
Does his job require he interact with prisoners?
What is it?
Ressler? You okay? Ressler!
[ To Ressler ] I set up checkpoints at all major roads and highways, sent Frank Gordon’s photo to State, Federal.
Alan Ray Rifkin – American college student, dropped out, joined the army, deployed to Afghanistan. In 2003, he was tried and convicted as an enemy combatant – fought alongside the Taliban. He’s scheduled for execution tomorrow. According to the charges, Rifkin and a few dozen Taliban fighters raided an Afghan village, killing dozens of civilians. At trial, Rifkin’s lawyers claimed it was friendly fire, that the American military destroyed the village, from the air, mistaking it for a Taliban outpost. The military denied it.
We need to take it seriously.
We’re not saying he’s innocent. But if you or Connolly are in danger –
We don’t know yet. We’re reviewing the file now.
Mr. Rifkin, my name is Agent Keen. I’m with the FBI.
I’m sorry, but I was told Mr. Rifkin had waived all representation.
Then you are?
Okay. First, let me tell you that I’m not here to reconsider your case. The court rulings are final.
It’s my understanding you filed for a demand of justice with The Judge.
He knows what I mean.
And who put you here?
You’re saying you were coerced?
Why wasn’t this presented at trial?
We should find the Marshal, ask him directly.
William Munson? Agent Keen. FBI. I’m investigating a case you’re connected to. The defendant is Alan Ray Rifkin.
I’m running out of time, Mr. Munson.  Alan Ray Rifkin is running out of time.
Came forward?  To whom?
Connolly was there?
You heard this?
Mr. Munson, did Agent Cooper physically coerce Rifkin?
We need to talk about Rifkin.
Sir, I need to know whether you –
Sir, may we speak privately?
I need to know what happened at the airport after you landed with Rifkin.
You beat a confession out of him.
Your transport log was doctored. This is the real log, which shows how long Rifkin was actually at the airport. There’s a two–hour gap.
Does it matter?
No, I don’t have a theory. I have a witness who says he heard you order you to beat a confession out of Rifkin. He saw it happen.
Did you beat him?
He’s being transferred for execution. We have to stop it until the court looks at his confession.
We’ll see if the Federal Clemency Officer agrees with you.
[To Cooper ] Are you telling me this, or is he?
I understand.
No. He’s the Federal Clemency Officer. I need to talk to him. Yes, please have him call me.
Connolly was right. They don’t consider the event log new evidence, and even if they did, the deadline to consider Rifkin’s factual innocence has passed. Do they realize how insane that is? His innocence can’t be considered?
[ On phone ] Cooper’s been taken.
The Judge, we think, as retribution for Rifkin’s execution.
[ To Aram ] Anything?
[ Excitedly ] We’ve got nothing! No license plate, no surveillance footage. They could be anywhere by now.
Because he coerced Rifkin’s confession.
Cooper admitted it to me.
Hastings? We’re getting a court order to talk to him over his doctor’s objections. He’s worried about further trauma.
Wait. Did you hear me? Rifkin was executed – an eye for an eye. Cooper is going to die.
I’m so sorry, Mr. Hastings. I can’t imagine how difficult this must be for you. But there are others still there, being held. I need to know where you were held.
Aram, the paper said Rifkin’s last words at his execution were “Good night, mother.” He said it to his spiritual adviser, Ruth Kipling. I just heard Hastings say it.
The Marshal that covered up for Cooper and Connolly – that’s the organization he reached out to.
I bet that’s where she’s holding them.
Red.
Ruth, this is not a tactic. I’m not trying to negotiate. … Yes, new information on the Rifkin case. Someone with high-level access is en route.
Pleas we found in Frank Gordon’s room from prisoners all over the country.
I think we’ve had enough judgment for today.
If I’m wrong about Tom, I don’t think I can handle any of it without him.
Oh, only a year. Well, we moved from up north. I was there for three years, actually, and – hey, babe. You remember Jolene from the baby shower?
We just bumped into each other outside. She’s looking for a place in the neighborhood.
Who?
You went to an art exhibit?
Yeah, why didn’t you bring your wife?
Let me give you my cell.
If you’re looking for a realtor, my girlfriend Ellie is awesome.
What’s going on with you two?
Because he’s looking for you.
Maguire’s body was found under a bridge near Broadway at 39th.
Metro P.D. got called in on an 808. They were told two men presented as FBI.
He’s not answering his cell.
You and I both know how they got here.
Ressler where is he? I know he came to you. I know you told him about that hospital.
You sent him after Tanida.
He’s not like you. He can’t just murder someone in cold blood and come out of it okay on the other end.
We need your help. We have to find Tanida before Ressler does. We’ve looked through his financials, his prison contacts, the brother, who – Tensei? The reborn.
What do you mean, he’s dead? Aiko Tanida is running his brother’s empire.
Reddington says Aiko Tanida’s dead; died the same night his brother was apprehended by Ressler’s task force.
It was falsified. We need to review what happened that night. Think about it – no one’s seen or heard from the guy in four years. Our last known photograph is older than that. Aiko Tanida’s not hiding. He’s dead. We need to review the case files. Someone else is running Tanida’s business.
“Most of the details”? What did we miss?
Bobby Jonica. Jonica was on the task force. He had intimate knowledge of Tanida’s enterprise. He knew everything key players, trade routes, distribution hookups. And he was able to avoid detection by making us believe Aiko Tanida was still alive. Jonica is Tensei.♤ 
He picked up Tanida. After that, nothing. We found his cell in his apartment. The GPS in his car has been deactivated. He’s off the grid.
Call an ambulance. Set a perimeter.
Ressler, no!
This isn’t the way.
Listen to me if you do this, you’re gonna go to jail for the rest of your life.
Don’t listen to him.
Put down the gun, Ressler!
Don’t listen to him.
Hey.
Mind if I join you?
How was your day?
What about her?
I guess it’s not happening. She called me and left a message said her fiancé got a job in Dayton.
I guess so. I’m kind of glad. I saw the way she looked at you. Come here. Kiss me, “Tim,” or whatever your name is.
Oh, it was supposed to be a surprise.
I can’t believe you teach fourth grade and have such little knowledge of pop culture.
That is Uncle Flippo. Trust me on this, flashlight butt will get you some serious cred.
Oh, yeah, says the man carrying the lunch box.
How long has she been missing?
I ran into her outside. She was looking for an apartment in the neighborhood, so I referred her to a friend who’s a real–estate agent.
Have you already searched her residence?
If there’s anything more we can do, please don’t hesitate to ask.
You’re late.
Is everything all right?
What is all this?
Of what? The timing mechanism for an explosive device?
Should I be worried?
What am I looking at?
Why am I looking at it?
Please. And you know this how?
My job isn’t to settle your grudges, so I’m gonna need a little more than your gut instinct that Ivan was involved.
So, Ivan ran some guy off the road. Or are you thinking it’s something a little more sophisticated?
It sounds like his beef’s with Moscow.
Here’s the information we have on our victim. Nathan Gregory Platt, 43, employed at Roys TV Repair since ’09. No wife, no kids.
Aram.
I was wondering if you could do me a favor. I need to pull the phone records for this number. The name’s Jolene Parker. Thank you.
Thanks, we’ll take it from here. ⋘⋙ Hey, can I ask you something? Why are you here?
There’s no shame in taking a couple days off. I mean, if it were me, I wouldn’t want to be here.
Okay, translation, please?
I’m not sure. Any ideas?
We should take it to the Computer Forensics Lab.
So, you’re saying our suspect is now in possession of this device?
State’s reaching out to the Russians, but getting them to cooperate will be one thing, and actually finding this Ivan will be a separate problem altogether.
Wait, when did you learn this?
And it didn’t occur to you to say something earlier?
I assume you have a better idea?
How do I do that?
I’m sorry. I didn’t want to wake you.
Jolene Parker – her real name is Lucy Brooks.
I heard from Detective Debarros. She’s a wanted criminal.
ViCAP. It’s the Bureau’s violent-criminal database. She’s a convicted felon – robbery, aggravated assault. Two years ago, her parole officer in Santa Fe reported her missing. Hasn’t been seen since.
I am so sorry.
She was here, in our house in our bedroom. And it’s because of me.
No. If you knew what I do
God, if she had done anything to you—
I’m gonna find her – who she works for. Whoever they are, whatever it takes, I’m gonna find her.
What’d you find?
Aram, you’re amazing.
Hey. You have a second?
I’m following up some leads on Jolene’s case, and I came across an address.
1896 LaVista Street. [ Where Tom is now ]
It’s not her home address. Maybe it’s her fiancé’s?
I thought I’d check it out.
Hey, can you hear me? Tom?
Aah! [ She gets just a glimpse of him ]
[ On phone ] The place was ransacked before I got here. There’s even a cache of burnt documents in a bucket outside, but they’re ashes now.
Male, Caucasian, over six–feet. Uh dark hair.
Excuse me. Keen.
Okay, I’m five minutes behind you. I don’t want to step on any toes, –
Yeah, if you could copy me on the evidence report once you’ve catalogued everything, I’d appreciate it.
He hacked the school’s security system and activated the automated evac protocols.
Have you ever seen this woman?
Her name is Jolene Parker. She was a sub at Tom’s school. But as of yesterday morning, she’s a missing person. I found high-end surveillance gear, a cache of documents, burner cells.
No.
Turns out Jolene Parker doesn’t exist. It’s an alias. I want to know who she is, and I want to know why the hell she’s inserted herself into our lives.
You can’t or you won’t?
Not to me. You said there’s always something you’re not telling me. Just once, I’d like to hear the whole truth from you.
You know what? Don’t worry about it. The truth is, I don’t need evidence to connect this to you. Jolene Parker is in my life because of you. None of this happened until you arrived on my doorstep. My life was great – my marriage, Tom. Thank God I have Tom, because with you, I never know what to believe.
How the hell would I know? Have fun with your project.
Any relation to–
Hello? Mr. Fisher, this is Agent Keen. I need to ask you a question about your daughter.
Is she familiar with a young man named Harrison Lee –
Whoa. Uh, I lost him.
He activated the Skeleton Key.
We believe Abby may be in danger.
We could use that. Aram, are any of the sub stations running within your five–mile radius?
To where?
Harrison, my name is Agent Keen.
You spent the last four months coming up with the perfect plan, and right now, nothing is going as expected. All of this, it was a romantic gesture, wasn’t it?
You must feel like your whole world is falling apart. But it isn’t. We can end this. Right now, you and I.
Harrison, no!
Harrison, I know you feel like this is your only option, but it’s not. You have a choice.
You and I both know that the car accident was only that. An accident. You did not want that man to die, did you? This isn’t what Abby would want.
We’re gonna crash. 
You guys there?
Yeah. You too. Hey, you hungry?  Tom’s cooking tonight, so that means there will be a ton of extra food.
You sure?
See you tomorrow.
I need some wine, preferably the entire bottle.
It’s not good. There was evidence of foul play.
There’s nothing concrete. MPD’s still processing the apartment.
They don’t, but when I went to the apartment, there was someone there – a man. He – he knocked me down.
No, I’m fine.
The police are looking for him.
I wish.
Wine.
I’m fine. It’s just work.
Mm.
I’m fine. I promise.
Really.
You were right.
What’s this?
I know this song. When I was a little girl, I had these terrible nightmares. I remembered flashes of- of fire and smoke. God, so much smoke. My dad would lay in bed with me and hold me in his arms and hum that song. He’d tell me I was safe – that everything was gonna be okay. You spent days building that damn thing. You knew about the song. My father.♤ You knew I’d find out the truth. And you wanted me to know that everything is going to be okay.
Nothing. I’m just feeling a little wonky.
What are you doing?
Yes!
I love you so much.
I am so late. But, uh, I love you.
What do you know about Tom?
No! We’re not doing that. Not today. You have been threatening to tell me the truth about my husband since the day we met, and I’m ready to listen. What do you know?
Me.
That’s it? He bought passports? My husband chose me. He inserted himself into my life because of you.
Why? How are we connected?
No, that is all that matters!♤ This is my life! Tell me!
What’s this?
The apple man. You watched them?
Bennett Cochran was killed by a woman who was mentally unstable, Dee Torres. Local police consider both cases accidental– a runaway cab and a woman suffering from a mental break. But according to Reddington, these are assassination by suicide. They call him “The Undertaker,” a man who somehow turns ordinary people into contract killers. Reddington believes that, in all of these cases, the killer died along with the victim.
According to Reddington, he contracts with clients around the world – anyone interested in hiring a killer without the slightest possibility of it ever tracing back to them.
I’m sure you have bills, like everyone else. He probably felt–
Yes. And both killers had additional problems– dementia, mental instability– conditions that made it possible for the police to explain away the events.
You said you wanted to renew our vows.
Work has been insane, and we’ve had to put so many things off, and I’m not doing it anymore. I want to marry this man!
Now, go get dressed. And, oh, just make sure he shaves. I’m not marrying George Michael.
Tom, everyone. Thing is, when you asked me to renew our vows, I thought it was odd. And then I realized how much we’ve been through in such a short time.So much has changed. But the more I thought about it, I realized this is the beginning of something amazing, a new chapter, a new us. And I wanted to take this opportunity to stand in front of you and all of our friends, everyone we love, and tell you how excited I am about what’s coming next because I have a feeling this is going to be one hell of a ride.
Could you have him run these prints, get me a name? 
What?
It’s called “Chicago Skyline.”
He’s been doing this for years. It’s in Boston, Tokyo, Seattle, Mexico City.
A network of dead assassins.
Let me guess – Danny is dying.
Moss isn’t home. Wife said he left the house 20 minutes ago.
Danny, stop! Danny! Stop! – Back up! FBI! –
Danny, stop! – Back up! Please. This isn’t how your wife or daughter want to remember you.
Whatever he’s paying you, it isn’t worth it. We can help. Don’t do this.
Is this really how you want to die? 
Keen.
We have one of the assassins in custody. We’re taking him in for questioning now.
They’re all sick. We know from their autopsies they’re terminally ill.
A–as far as I know.
Did you find his name?
Hey, Craig. Can we talk? – 
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?!
I know who you are.
I know about the time you did at Wasco. I know about the warrants. I know about you, Christopher Maly.
Somebody provided you with an identity, a history, embedded you into my life. I want to know who, and I want to know why.
I never did like you 
[ On phone ] Ressler, hey, what’s up? Yeah. Of course. No. I’ll be right there.
Actually I did.
Ressler called. I have to step out. He isn’t cooperating.
So?
How? His doctors?
What about life insurance?
Hey. Can I ask for a favor? About today, I got to be somewhere.
What are you doing?
Who tells you?
Jolene Parker?
My husband hides a key in the house. What’s it for– a safe deposit box? A storage unit?
Tell me about Tom.
Niki? Is that some woman he sees?
We got to get out of here. 
The south elevator has no cameras, empties into the basement. Two doors past the mechanical room lead to the alleyway.
What now? What are you doing?
A man just jumped through the window. There’s a body on the sidewalk.
Negotiator’s en route.
Ressler.
Find what you were looking for? 
I can’t do this anymore. I can’t look at him, let alone touch him.
I don’t think I can.
What is it? What does it mean?
Hey, babe. You know, I was thinking – it was so good to see your brother again.
So, I left him a message. I thought maybe we could have dinner before he left. And I never heard back.
He just left? Never even said goodbye?
It’s crazy, right?
The police say they have a person of interest.
They’re not sure.
They found blood. Matches hers.
The desk.
By the computer – That’s where I saw your keys.
If they worked together, why would he murder her?
They’re an extraction team. Cut their teeth on Milosevic’s protective detail during the ethnic cleansing of the Yugoslav wars.
To the best of our knowledge, the Pavlovich brothers have no political agenda. They specialize in snatch-and-grabs ranging from kidnap and ransom to extracting political dissidents. Reddington says he has a contact. A money launderer sourced by the brothers claims they’re coming after a Chinese scientist named Xiaoping Li.
They knew CIA protocol. That if the routes were compromised, they’d send in air support. These guys weren’t based domestically. They snuck in, and they’re gonna sneak out. We should coordinate with Homeland, get their faces everywhere.
Busy.
How do you know? Do you have a lead? Something we can
Wait. What? Where is he?
Don’t be.
You want to know what’s hard? Sitting here when all I really want to do is get my hands around his throat. Shouldn’t we follow him?
They all work for you.
Tom? Tom?
Where’d you get that thing?
That’s where that was. I’ve been looking for it. My father gave it to me.
Your pot is gonna boil over. You’re cooking? I thought we were going out for Thai.
How was your day?
Ah, no, I wish. I was cooped up in the office all day.
All right. Uh, keep stirring.
What?
He’s gone. My husband is gone.
Do you know we had sex the other night? Do you have any idea how filthy that makes me feel?
I fell in love with him. I married him. We- we were gonna have – I was excited to have a child with him. He was the one person I chose in my life who made me happy, who made me feel safe. What does that say about me? Everything that we had was just a figment of my imagination. Worse than a figment. A lie. It was right in front of my face, and I didn’t see it. I just believed it. All of it.
If you tell me to be patient one more time, I swear to God I am going to find him, I’m gonna find answers, and I’m going to do it with or without your help. The case. I need a lead.
The Pavlovich brothers burnt that chopper to cover up evidence DNA, fingerprints. Those things might have identified the brothers, but what about the chopper?
That’s what they did, but where did they do it? Is there a deeper forensic analysis we can run? What particulates were in the heat exchange? Was there moisture in the compressor?
So we cross–reference the two?  Exactly.
We have a lead on Xiaoping Li.
We think she’s being held at Halifax Agro-Chem in Falls Church. We’re assembling a team.
I don’t want to talk about Tom with you.
Just don’t bother yourself. I’ll deal with Tom.
Well, I’ll find out, won’t I?
You can’t.
What are we looking at?
I can’t get ahold of Reddington.
Mm–hmm.
No.
I’m going to find Reddington, get some answers. ⋘⋙ Reddington, I need you to call me, please. I need some help with the case.
Two years wasted. Two years we spent. On what? Do you care at all what you’ve done to me What you’ve done to my life? What has it done to you? Who could do such a thing? Finding you, stopping you. You’d think I’d be happy you’re gonna spend the rest of your life in prison.
Your job? That was our life! We were going to have a baby to – You begged me to have a baby!
Stop talking about your job! You, this. Everything was a lie! My life was a lie! Every feeling, every memory. Say something to your wife, who’s dying in front of you. Say something.
What does that mean?
[ On phone ] Hey.
Where are we on Xiaoping Li?
Waiting on Reddington. He still hasn’t shown.
I will be, just as soon as – I’m gonna have to call you back.
Nice try.
Yes? – Where is she?
Xiaoping Li. You took her. You used the FBI and the Pavlovich brothers to get to Tom and what, get Xiaoping? Make some bigger deal? Trade on her secrets?
Where is she?
If we don’t find her If she gets sent back to the Chinese, she’s gonna die.
We think they’re putting her on a cargo ship. We’re not sure. We’re looking over the manifests, timetables, – and shipping routes.
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?
Yeah, I did. If you’re looking for sympathy, you might want to start with honesty. Here’s an example of honesty, Tom. You’ve been making me pancakes for two years. I hate pancakes ❗
Do it.
I will find you.
I lost him. He’s gone.
This whole time, you’ve never let him out of your sight. Your people are following him now.
How is this all gonna end?
Sam. It’s the same building. I checked like four times.
No.
If Reddington did fly all the way to Nebraska just to talk to my dad before he died, there must have been something he wanted.
Since when does Reddington have friends? [ Cellphone buzzing ]
Not until I know whether the photo’s real.
Hello. [ Door opens, Jamie leaves ] Where’s Tom?
Red, where is Tom?
What the hell is that?
He’s, what, some kind of political strategist?
He’s causing trouble for some politician in your pocket, and now you want the FBI to arrest him?
These cases you often ask for something in return. Now I’m asking. Tom I want to know his every move.
Paul Fredrick Smithson.
Where did they land?
Federal agents! Hands where I can see them.
It’s a case of stolen identity. He cloned his credit card and passport, and he’s a salesman who travels frequently.
You think he did this?
I just watched a man give CPR to his dying wife, and you’re telling me it was a media stunt?
This guy’s been groomed.
Wait. So he’s not even running for anything?
Sorry. Husbands lie to their wives. I have no problem believing this guy is capable of just about anything.
Reddington.
My father died at 5:30. Red left one hour before.
Chandler drove up from the south.
We had a fight. He left the house. I don’t even know where he went.
Why was Chandler even on this bridge at all? His house and his office are both in Werther County, which is the opposite direction.
And Red was right. The accident–investigation squad didn’t find any skid marks leading up to the drop-off point. Chandler didn’t even try to stop.
Or maybe the plan was to go over the side.
As crazy as it seems, it did work. I mean, this Chandler guy is everywhere every news show, talk show.
We know you spoke to patrol, but we’re not with the NYPD. We’re with the FBI.
Well, actually, we were hoping you could help us understand a few things.
It must be difficult to see her so traumatized.
We’re just looking for the facts.
Let me guess a van.
On the other hand, suicide is consistent with someone who just ran an entire family off a bridge.
I told you there’s nothing here.
Which is?
What is – Who are these people?
Is he why we’re here?
Mm–mm.
My father died of lung cancer.
No.
Let’s wait for the owner. You once said the reason you were here was because of my father.
Did the two of you know each other? Don’t tell me you were friends. You don’t have friends.
Is that why you were in his hospital room the day he died? I talked to you on the phone that day. You never mentioned you were there.
There was something he wanted to tell me. I could tell by his voice the last time we spoke. But he didn’t. Was that because of you? You were at my father’s bedside the day he died. I’ve been with you almost every day since. You’ve said nothing not a word. The two of you obviously knew one another, but he never mentioned you. Why? How did you know each other? Why were you there?
Clear. Room’s clean.
Okay, that’s the last one.
And the second and third photo I sent you appear to be alarm codes and wiring schematics.
What do you see?
The Kingmaker.
That’s not going to be possible.
The Kingmaker is dead. Red? Red?
Patrick Chandler?
You’re under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.
Right. My father died around 5:30 PM. What are you getting at?
When Reddington was in the room. He was there when my father died.
Were you in the hospital room when he died? Did you kill my father? Did you kill him?
I was right.
There was something he wanted to tell me before he died, and you didn’t want me to know.
Go to hell.
Understand?! How could I possibly understand when you take someone I love away from me and then try to justify it?!
We’re done. I’m done. This ends right now. God, you’re a monster.
I didn’t know where else to go. 
I should have let you rough him up.
No matter how this all turns out, I’m gonna find Tom, or whatever the hell his name is, and I’m gonna take him apart piece by piece until he tells me everything.
I believe he was inserted into my life in an effort to locate Raymond Reddington. I believe he had advanced knowledge that Reddington would contact me. How or why, I don’t know.
I also believe that since making contact, Tom Keen’s dual purpose has been data collection – and counterintel.
I did not. And if you would refrain from referring to him as my husband, I’d appreciate that.
No.
When Tom Keen realized I wasn’t going to share my work details with him he insisted on surrendering himself to me so that he could front-door infiltrate this facility for further data collection.
It is. He wanted inside this facility.
I wanted to investigate him.
So I could see how deep this rabbit hole would run.
That’s really a stupid question.
My letter of resignation.
As of today, I’m requesting an immediate transfer out of the task force.
I’ve made up my mind.
He’ll have to tell it to someone else.
I am only valuable because I’m willing to speak to Reddington, – and that is no longer the case.
He killed my father. Reddington went into my father’s hospital room when he was alive. And when Reddington came out, my father was dead.
Sir, Reddington should tell you what he knows, or you should detain him here indefinitely.
Those lives are on his hands.
Sir, please accept my resignation.
I’ll do the case. But when it’s over, I’m finished. Understood? I’m done.
Sounds like an elaborate plan just to get to you.
Good to see you again. Thanks for taking the time. We don’t want to interfere with your investigation.
It’s too deadly to study?
If it went airborne. So you’re saying you think it didn’t?
That’s the virus? –
This doctor friend of yours tell me about him.
“Was.” Now he’s a criminal.
Dembe, do you mind trading seats with me? 
You’ve researched it? Well, it was recently used as a weapon to target a man named Paul Blankenship.
How do you know that?
There are four horsemen.
“Space Agent UD-4126.” How stupid do you think I am?
He’s a patient in a mental facility. This little field trip had nothing to do with trying to solve the case and everything to do with you getting me alone in that plane so you could try to change my mind.
Yeah, you keep saying that. Who? Who is this mysterious someone?
Have you ever had a selfless moment in your entire life? One where you weren’t trying to think of some angle you could play or advantage you could gain? My God, it’s amazing. If you expect me to forgive you –
Catching a cab to the airport. I’m flying back on my own.
Look, I’m sorry.
The “doctor” we met with. Sanders is a patient in a mental institution.
Sanders is researching a lethal virus from inside a psych ward?
You really believe he’s working with someone on the outside who’s testing his theories, manufacturing an antidote?
Bruce Sanders won’t talk to me.
I need your help.
We’re not.
What’s this?
Let’s talk about Space Agent UD-4126.
Did he visit you here?
Did he come to you for help?
I need answers.
Who came to you for help?
You have to give me the scientist’s name. Who’s doing the experiments?
His name.
What is it? What did you see?
Because that’s where I saw it a badge with the UD classification.
This isn’t about my husband or even what Reddington did to my father. This is all of it. It’s too much. I’m not strong enough.
Where do you want it to happen?
Dembe, it’s me. Is he there? I need to see Reddington.
Tell me about the people you blackmailed. Who are they? You don’t seem like someone with enemies.
I’m gonna need names.
I’ve got to hand it to you. It’s a pretty sharp play. Infecting people with a fatal virus that only you have the antidote for and then telling them they can’t have that antidote unless they do exactly as you ask. Such a smart plan that I borrowed it. Now, I’m no doctor, so I don’t know how fast this virus of yours takes to set in, but I know it will kill you, soon. So you’re gonna do what I say and give me those five names, ’cause that’s how blackmail works, sweetheart. Let me know when you’re ready to talk.
[ Various phone calls ] What do you know about recent criminal activity in Berlin? … “Aussiedler”? How do you spell that? … Make a sign that reads “There’s nothing here to see” …  What about the Tambov gang? … Z–E–M–U–N. Travel by with those.  A whole bunch that they can see … 
Oh, my God. It’s all connected.♤
All of it, everything the blacklist. We’ve been looking at it all wrong. We see these cases Reddington gives us as individual, as if they’re disconnected, but what if they’re not random? What is there’s a larger pattern to all of it?:
That’s what I thought. That’s what we’re trained to think. But that’s not how he thinks. Look at this like he would, like a criminal. Reddington said he’s bracing for war. And in a war, you need allies. Put yourself in his position. It’s not just the FBI who’s after him. What if there’s someone else, someone he can’t stop alone? What better way for a criminal to turn the tables on someone than to get the FBI on his side? Our resources and our protection not to expand his empire, but simply to survive.
Sanders said there’s an impending apocalypse, and Vogel’s words to us? “He’s coming”?
It’s a jailbreak.
Sir, the new information about the cases, how they’re connected at the end of all this, Reddington is the target. Someone’s after him. I really think my resignation –
I need you to come with me.
You need to get in the car.
You need to get in the car now.
They voided your agreement. The deal it’s off. You don’t have immunity.
We need to leave. (Dembe)
We don’t have time for this.
We have to go.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life in solitary confinement? The full force of the FBI is coming for you.
You want me to tell you you were right, don’t you? That’s what this is about.
I’m not gonna give you that.
I’m not going to forgive you for killing my father.
I know about the cases, how they’re connected, somehow.
I know about Berlin –  that he’s a person, that he’s coming for you. Red, the FBI is coming for you.
You don’t always get to have your way. You don’t get out of this.
There’s no way you’re out of here!
If this is another one of your games to try to trick me into forgiving you for Sam …
… for what you’ve done. You have ruined my life. And I swear to God, right now, I want to kill you. But there are answers I need, and I can’t get them without you.
Sir, about Reddington –
He can help. The crash, attack – whatever it was – I’m sure it had something to do with Berlin.
Are we being decommissioned?
Yes – after this case.
Witness accounts vary. Sightings have been reported from midtown to Wall Street.
There’s nothing official about this.
It’s vital I speak to him.
He could help us.
I have no allegiance to Reddington. He killed my father. But this man we’re hunting – Berlin – he’s somehow in the center of all this, and my only objective is finding him. Reddington can help us.
What are you talking about?
Get me Ressler and Meera.
I can’t reach them. They’re already in the field. I need an address.
[ Comes through crowd ] Ressler! Ressler!
Meera! Meera! Oh, my God. No! No.
Meera’s dead. You said we were all targets. Why?
It was Tom. If Berlin had the names of the agents in the task force, he had to have gotten them from Tom. Sam’s name was also in that book. Why? How is my father involved in this?
The manifest. I just received it from Reddington.
The third is in ICU. They’re just bringing him out of surgery now.
That leaves three convicts at large.
One of them has to be Berlin.
We know about the man they call “Berlin.” We know he’s one of those three, and we need you to tell us which one.
Why don’t you tell us?
They don’t know if Cooper’s gonna make it through the night. You still haven’t told me how Sam was involved in this.
And that’s why you killed him.
What truth? The only memory I have of my real father is from the night of the fire. I remember him pulling me out of the flames saving me.
Why? Because he’s a fugitive on the “Most Wanted” list?
Was that your source?
Did he find Berlin?
[ At Cooper’s bedside ] You, Meera, it’s all because of me.
Don’t do it. Do you hear me?! – Tom. Please.
[ Grabs Red’s arm ] No!
Please go. I’ll finish it. This is between us.
Her kids were only 8 and 5. [ Referring to Meera ]
This report identifies him as the third guard on the manifest.
Yeah, that’s what all the prisoners said – he cut his hand off.
Berlin cut off his own hand?
The man you killed wasn’t Berlin.
You know? How?
But you didn’t say anything?
So, he’s still out there. I’m sure you’ll find him.
Tom told me something right before he died.
“Your father’s alive.”
That man – Berlin – he’s out there.
Justice is freaking out.
Hellfire missiles? – Seriously?
Martin won’t protect the task force. He doesn’t care that Berlin is still targeting us. And without Cooper to defend our actions –
Most people don’t care that Google knows their search history.
You have a lead.
Lord Baltimore?
And he has a new target?
Berlin has hired a skip tracer who calls himself Lord Baltimore.
He’s more than a bounty hunter. He’s a statistician.
He’s a data miner. Aram, can you pull up that file you showed me? ⋘⋙ Rowan Mills. She works as a data engineer at Quancord Analytics.
And you said this wasn’t the first time you were targeted?
Looking for what? Bank accounts? Credit-card numbers?
They were looking for someone who doesn’t want to be found.
Did you hear what she said?
How easy it is to track someone? I mean, I just feel like – I don’t know – someone is watching me.
You talk to Dr. Friedman yet?
The visits are mandatory.
You’re too healthy to talk to a shrink?
Yeah. And in my professional opinion, I think you need to talk to Dr. Friedman.
This person calls you by name.
What about the apartment? Any reason to believe there might be something missing, – out of place?
Hey, perfect timing. I’m gonna need you to trace a call.
Any idea what was taken?
Why?
You think they might be looking for one of us?
Me too.
Rowan Mills received a message last night. I need a location.
Ressler. Let’s get Mills in here. I want to see how she reacts to this.
The same data that was hacked from your work terminal is on the laptop we found here. You stealing data for Berlin to find Raymond Reddington?
I mean, you got to do better than that.
And this Nora – She died?
Let’s talk about your sister. Now, this is Rowan, and Nora’s on the left.
How could you tell them apart?
And Nora?
She pressured you? How?
And when you refused, she hit you?
Yes.
Rowan, we can’t hold you. We have no probable cause.
Agent Ressler.
Yeah.
Reddington has a subscription to Cat Fanatic?
What the hell is going on? Martin said you were extracted by Mossad.
Targets. Turns out Berlin didn’t contract Lord Baltimore to find you. He’s looking for a woman.
We’re not sure. We only know her profile. Aram was able to narrow the search, but that still leaves us with over 200 potential targets.
Who? W-who is Naomi Hyland?
She’s in protective custody. Wait. I don’t understand. Uh, how do you know?
Why? Who the hell is Naomi Hyland?
You’re gonna have to tell him.
Okay, I’ll let them know.
Get down!
I need backup! –
Dembe, put him on. I found Lord Baltimore.
Where is she?
You are Lord Baltimore. You were paid by a man who calls himself Berlin to extract Naomi Hyland. I need to know! Where was she taken? 
A woman’s life is in jeopardy here. I need Nora to tell me where she is.
I am asking her! 
Well, that’s not exactly how it works.
That’s because Rowan’s unaware of Nora and Nora’s unaware of Rowan. That’s how dissociative identity disorder works. The two can’t conspire.
You were at her apartment. You’re in her photos. What are you, some kind of handler?
You know I think you were right. I think Nora survived that incident in Mosul.
Nora killed Rowan because she envied her. She wanted to become her. She wanted to be the good sister, the sister who didn’t get abused by her uncle.
No, Rowan is dead. You murdered your sister, didn’t you, Nora? That’s what caused the split – the trauma and guilt of the murder.
It was playing that night, wasn’t it? 
Do you remember how it felt that night? Do you remember what you were feeling, Nora, when you killed your sister? It’s over, Nora. Marcus cut a deal. Tell me where you took Naomi Hyland.
We got here too late.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! [ Breathing raggedly  ] The man with one hand, what did he instruct you to say?
I talked to Reddington. He couldn’t find her.
Yeah, apparently Martin had to negotiate his release.
My husband –
– was an impostor, a fake. Keen was never his name.
Why are you all smiles?
What? Martin – he’s gone? Well, who do we answer to now?
Medical school?
Your ex-wife –
Jennifer.
I confirmed your daughter was placed in protective custody with her mother in @1990. The Marshal service lost contact @seven years ago. She is unaccounted for.
What?
What was stolen?
And according to you?
Dante Stewart, the notorious arms dealer, the Juarez Cartel, the entire Marbella Crime Syndicate. Reddington claims these are just a few of the criminals who funnel money through Monarch Douglas. Our contacts at Treasury say Monarch’s records are spotless. They’re in full compliance. Despite that, according to Reddington, they’re legendary for laundering the money of the criminal elite without any traceable accounting. There has to be some kind of record. That must be what they’re looking for.
Which is apparently more valuable than the millions in assets they left lying in that Vault.
Everything okay?
Agents Ressler and Keen.
Where’s the Vault?
We’re just in time, then.
Agents Ressler and Keen, FBI. We understand you’re headquartered in Manhattan.
No inconsistencies in my witness statements. They hacked the system, shut it down, deleted everything back to a half-hour before they hit. What?
You got picture?
Yeah. Got it. Go.
Uh, Aram, can you zoom in on number 4?
That’s a woman. She looks scared. This wasn’t a robbery. It was a kidnapping.
 What can you tell us about her?
We’re gonna need a copy of Kaja Tomczak’s employee file.
The apartment is owned by Monarch?
Did you know Miss Tomczak well?
Hey, you guys see this up here?
I don’t think so.
Smells like roses.
What? Why?
I’m sorry, I don’t know what a rum-soaked, rose –
Lovely. Now what?
You’re safe now.
What’s the rendezvous point?
And her associates? Have you identified them?
Rough trade for a bank clerk.
That’s incredible.
She drained the accounts of every criminal who had money at that bank. She keeps it all in her head. That’s how the bank does it. She can give us account numbers, amounts. [ Sees armed person on video feed ] Who are our friends?
Out of the question. She’s coming back to the States.
Agent Harold Cooper already did. Perhaps you’d like to spe– [ Salerno punches her. They begin a viscious fist fight ]
Ressler!!
Aah! [ Gunshot ] [ Gasps ] Ressler!
Who do you work for?
What was that back there?! You almost got me killed!
More than a few. Your reaction time was crap.
It’s bad?
They’re watching every move.
Uh, w– where do we go? How do we get out of here if they’re monitoring the streets, the sidewalks? –
We had to! Salerno’s dirty. The safe house was assaulted by a TAC team. And why the hell are we being trailed by Mossad?!
She took down Salerno, covered our escape. But Kaja’s been shot.
Got it.
Cooper?
Get us out of here.
There are a million dirty cops between here and there, and they’re all after her.
Can we trust him?
What the hell?
Reddington. How did you–?
What are you doing?
And Kaja?
No. He’s up to something else.
Rosa Heredia.
His manicurist.
Well, she was trained as a surgeon.
Hey, Rosa. We know you’re treating Kaja. Where’s your patient?
 I don’t want to have to call for backup.
I know what you’re trying to pull, and it’s not gonna happen.
Bank robber, embezzler, thief. You put us on this case so you could get to the girl so you could steal Berlin’s money.
You’re gonna use her to get your wife back.
Not for the thousands of people who are gonna lose their lives because of his actions. This man is a psychopath! That money is going to fund terror all over the world, and I’m not gonna let that happen for the sake of one woman.
I found Kaja.
We froze the escrow accounts where you parked Berlin’s cash.
I’m sorry.
We can find another way.
You can’t hold up your end. He’ll kill you.
I’m sorry.
In the taxi in Warsaw. I came at you pretty hot.
When Kaja was down, you talked her through the worst of it. We could have lost her. You did good.
Your door was open.
You’re an asset I’m charged with protecting. I transferred the money to keep you safe. I was just doing my job. As far as I’m concerned, every life that that psycho takes from this point forward is on you. I hope she’s worth it.
How do we know Kaja gave up all the accounts at Monarch?
A new identity when this is all over. A sizeable contribution to her pension in exchange for protecting you and your friends.
I’ll scream.
If you’re trying to help me, why don’t you put the gun down?
Who are you?! I’ve seen you following me.
Open up your bag. Open up your bag. Open it up.
I’m sorry.
Where’s Naomi Hyland?
I need to talk to her.
You’re hiding her from me.
Same as everyone else, I guess. He ran an investment firm but was being investigated by the S.E.C. for fraud. He was stealing life savings and pensions. Only to turn up with his heart ripped from his chest. Probably by one of his clients. Police say that whoever did it was trying to make a point.
He’s harvesting organs killing innocent people to sell off their parts?
And you know how to find him?
Pass.
How does an Iranian end up working for Mossad?♤
How did you find us in Warsaw? Who told you we were there? 
How do we know we can trust her?
You know Reddington sent her to Warsaw. There has to be something going on there.
Dr. Ryerson, what did you find?
All of which means what?
Mrs. Wyatt, we really need you to look at the reports.
We checked. There’s no record of your husband ever receiving a donor organ.
Unless you talk, there’s nothing we can do to protect you.
Your husband was one of his clients?
Excuse me?
Exactly, he killed Paul Wyatt because he didn’t get his 500 grand in the annual rental fee.
Covington didn’t kill him to reuse the heart. He did it to send a message.
Consulting on what? –  
You’re the medical examiner? The licensing board has you listed as a general surgeon. Albee: Yeah, well, I wear several hats.
What exactly do you do for the fund?
They paid you over $200,000 last year.
Hello? I need to talk to him. I’d like to borrow Mr. Kaplan.
Maybe this was a mistake.
You said yourself it would take weeks to secure the necessary court orders, and how many more victims will there be by then?
Four bodies, Dr. Albee. You performed an autopsy on all four in the last year.
Fine. I’ll answer for you. You’re a supplier for Dr. James Covington. You provide him with vital organs for him to sell, and he pays you through the Wellbright Fund.
How much time do you have?
Fine. But first, you need to make a phone call.
Aram just finished the mockup for the medical file on our fictitious donor.
30 minutes ago. Aram even generated a social and W-2 in case they run a background check. What’s our E.T.A. for delivery?
I just sent you an image of a man who matches our suspect’s description.
Heads up, everybody. Target’s on the move. Ressler, he’s headed towards the front door.
Ohh!
We just lost our only lead to Covington.
The one who’s getting the pig’s heart? Who is it?
So, you know him?
I would have thought he’d be more cautious about where he chooses to hang out.
You wanted to see me?
Oh, Ressler. Yeah. She wanted to suspend him because he was –
Well, that’s ridiculous. I’m fine.
You’re concerned that I’m fine.
I will mourn when we get Berlin.
Fine. It will give me more time to hunt Berlin.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I am doing the best I can to handle this.
Thank you.
[Cellphone vibrates] It’s Reddington. [Sighs] Hey. Did you get a lead on Covington? What are we looking at?
We’ve got a number on Covington. Aram’s working a trace.
He said he had a removal. He’s gonna repossess another organ.
This has to be the place. We’ve been to every retail store, office park, and restaurant in the area. We got 20 minutes till Covington kills his next victim. What are you doing?
A whole lot of nothing.
Yeah. There’s some kind of access stairway.
Back away from the table.
Hands in the air! Step away from the table now!
It’s over, Dr. Covington. We know about your business. You lost your license for performing an experimental operation on a child. Well, not this one. Not today.
He needs to be in a hospital.
I’m not discussing this with you.
So you know better?
Then his parents can request an exception to the rule.
You killed Paul Wyatt. You ripped the heart out of his chest.
If we take him in now, that kid won’t make it. Can you live with that?
Yeah, and right now, he’s that boy’s only chance. Look at his parents. What if that were your kid?
Can you cover with Cooper and Aram? Just buy us some time.
We have to let him do this.
Hey, you think Reddington knew that Covington was trying to save kids?
It’s a trade-off I’d make.♤
Yeah.
Thanks, but I think I’m just gonna head out.
You’re wrong.
Oh, you’re right about that.
You’re wrong if you think you found Reddington.
If he was found, it’s because he wanted to be and he wanted you to find him.
If he wanted you here, he has a reason.
That’s why I don’t trust you – because I don’t know what the reason is – and I’m guessing neither do you.
[Sighs] Hey, sir? Look, I’m sorry about that incident – with the, um, frisking.
[Laughs] Yeah. That’s my thing. I’m a federal agent.
You, too.
Where’s Naomi Hyland?
What does that mean – you’ve already set her up with a cozy new life in Saint Kitts or Solvang?
She spent nine days with Berlin. We have to debrief her. She could know something his real name, his location.
You’re not hiding her from the FBI. You’re hiding her from me.
According to Reddington, three recent incidents prove the U.S.government is still conducting mind-control experiments. Terry Cho, a middle-school teacher who killed seven of his coworkers during his lunch break. Construction worker Henry Lee Bryce used a hammer and a box cutter. Killed by police. The third, Maddie Thornhill, single mom who opened fire at a bank in Reston. Reddington has alleged that these crimes weren’t random, but orchestrated by spooks the government continues to finance through their black-ops budget.
What would you say if I told you to pull Frank and Naomi Hyland’s phone records for the past five years?
Would you ask me to show it to you?
She’s talking to someone right now.
Like what?
Maddie Thornhill told us her life fell apart after a series of anonymous accusations.
Their problems metastasized like a cancer, striking to the heart of these victims’ identities.
All I’m saying is that some people aren’t wired to handle stress, and someone took advantage of that.
The extreme-warrior gene.
Yeah. Agent Navabi has identified 11 other cases in the last 18 months. No connection other than –
Sir? You know something?
Don’t know what that is.
If it’s black-budget, how am I supposed to gain access? 
Senator, is that a yes or a no?
We’ve been tracking a spike in violent crimes, mass shootings.
Everything the Senator sent is redacted entire pages.
Yeah, “Elegant Lady,” “Forest Green.” I mean, if any of these are Subproject 7, it’d be impossible to tell.
What?
The Polyglot how do we find him?
But you know where to find him?
I write mostly about social-science experiments. Researching one right now, actually the black-ops project Subproject7.
I’ve seen the white paper. It’s heavily redacted. Wha– [Chuckles] How did you?
Who are these people?
This man here who is he? I’ve seen his face before.
Dr.Linus Creel PHD in clinical psychology from N.Y.U. After Subproject 7 disbanded, he opened a private practice.
No, it’s a modified MMPI-2 the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory but it’s heavily modified. He reconfigured the test questions to flag aggression and low impulse control.
Aram, if I asked you to create an E.M.R., could you feed it into their database?
Yeah family history, immunization records, billing addresses, but most importantly, we’ll need a full psychiatric history.
[ Scoffs ] That’s an understatement.
In college, postgrad. I had, you know. A rough patch.
I took some pills. They had to pump my stomach.
Kind of both. It’s not what you think. I- it’s not like I ever wanted to commit suicide.I took them in front of someone.
I had this boyfriend Ronnie. I was so young, – and he – Was cheating. I was such an idiot.
Maybe, yeah.
I’d kill him. I- I- I mean, I would never kill him. That’s not what I meant. It’s just a figure of speech.
Tom. His name was Tom.
I’d never.
Have at him. I’d chain him up.
And I’d force him to tell me about all of the lies, the secrets he kept. I’d make him my prisoner. It’s pretty messed up, huh?
Nothing, really.
Like the Sins of the Father. That it?
My father died in a fire. I was 4.
I don’t remember, actually.
You think I don’t want to remember?
When the nurse drew my blood, she said that you ordered a genetic screening.
Go.
Okay. I see white letters on a black screen.
Got it.
“7” “3” (A few more characters.)
Okay.
I told you I-I need your help.
Maybe my father was an addict, too.
They’re under here somewhere. Okay, got them. Are you calling the cops or something?
[ Breathing heavily ] Oh, my God.
I mean, what do you expect? [ Exhales sharply ] ‘Course I got it. Magic.
The killers. Everyone in this file has murdered someone.
Duncan Prince – where is he?!
We’ve looked at every conceivable database. There’s nothing on an Amber Deveraux.
Amber Deveraux doesn’t exist. That’s how he’s triggering his clients. Anonymous allegations that can never be verified. Poor reviews online, blind accusations at work. And by girlfriends who don’t exist.
Yeah.
Duncan must have seen this. Senator Sheridan. That’s where our shooter’s going.
Duncan, no! Listen to me. You. Put the gun down. You don’t want to do this. He lied to you, manipulated you. It’s not your fault.
Duncan, listen to me. He’s making you believe that you don’t have a choice!
Medic! I need a medic! 
Hey.
Mm-hmm.
And?
What gas station?
Hello, Mrs. Hyland.
No. He doesn’t want us to talk.
I’m sorry. I just I have a ton of questions in this notebook about the case, but the truth is, I didn’t come here just to ask you about Berlin.
Yes.
The day Raymond Reddington walked into my life, everything changed – everything I believed about – [Sighs] You were married to the man. You had a life, a child.
Yeah.
W- why doesn’t he want me to see you?
I think it might be because you know something about how the two of us might be connected.
What does he want from me? 
I think you know the answer to that. Who is he?
The gunman, the sniper. He works for you, doesn’t he?
How long has he been following me?
I want him gone.
I told you to get rid of him.
Yeah, I can handle myself. I just I don’t want him watching me. What is all this? [ Siren wails in distance ]
Maddox Beck’s wife?
Well, how is that possible? They died trying to bomb BP’s London Office in response to the Gulf Oil Spill.
So who killed her?
I don’t understand. Weren’t they partners? Didn’t they found the Front together?
These are the last known photographs of Maddox Beck and his wife. They’re the founders of the Front.
She was pregnant?
And the mother?
Think he beat her?
Clay? From where? That’s odd, isn’t it?
Then why did they steal it?
It’s just taking longer than I thought.
Yeah. I’m going out back. [ Holds out wad of bills ] This is for last week. Do it one more week, and I’ll pay you double. I’ll be back in one hour.
[ To her double ] Thursday. Same time? 
You didn’t tell this to the FBI?
I could say the same thing about you.
And the markings? What do they mean?
You said the priests were sent to the end of the world. Where?
Red’s source says the map points to Burial Ridge in Staten Island. [where else?!] It’s the largest native American burial ground in New York.
What are you talking about?
The bones contain the DNA of the plague. Once he has it, he can replicate it.
Got it.
There’s another engraving here. Looks like, what, a moon?
The strain’s final resting place.
[ On phone ] Aram, are you there? What is it? What’s 31 miles east of Burial Ridge? 
Is there another way in here?
Show me.
FBI! Don’t move!
Put it down.
You’re not walking out of here.
I said put it down.
Is that why you killed your wife?
[ Groans ] They have it. It’s gone. The plague, it’s gone. [ Breathing heavily ] 
He was in possession of the strain.
He threatened to release it.
Thank you.
What? What? What are you talking about?
Reddington asked you to do – ?
What did Reddington ask you to do?
Your wife made it perfectly clear your daughter has no interest in seeing you.
The FBI is not in the business of handling your personal affairs.
If she is in danger, we will protect her, either from Berlin or you.
You have no right to have anything to do with that girl, not since the night you abandoned her.
You just upended your ex-wife’s entire life. I’m not gonna let you do the same thing to her.
[ Sighs ] Oh, God. I am not jealous.
“Our relationship”?
No, no, no. We’re not doing that.
Let me be perfectly clear. Aram is not going to help you find your daughter. And the guy you have following me. Either you get rid of him, or I will.
I need to go inside.
Can I go inside? 
Patient Zero has been I.D.’d as Sharon McManus. Prelim autopsy confirms we are dealing with a genetically modified strain of pneumonic plague.
We have no idea, but it is working at an accelerated rate.
From what the CDC can tell, the contagion works in three phases, the first of which is incubation. Right now, it is dormant in their immune systems. It is not airborne yet, but that is only going to last for the first few hours.
It turns the victim symptomatic, then infectious. Based on what we can tell from the time of death and the rapid depletion of Patient Zero’s target cells, those healthy-looking people will be dead in nine hours.
 My God. D.C. was just the beginning. [ Dialing, ringing ] They’re gonna be on planes. Aram, get me the FAA. 
Every matching profile is a potential follower infected with the plague.
We can take him down, isolate him before he boards.
 Sighs ] He’s not at the gate. Aram, you got eyes?
I’m gonna double back.
Officer down! I need a medic!
Samar, you’re gonna bleed out! You’ve got to open this door! It’s out.
You’ll be okay.
Shh, shh.
Mm, nothing.
Nipple guards. A year ago, I, uh Tom and I, we were going to adopt a newborn, and we were having a baby shower. And one of the guests, this teacher, she brought nipple guards.
Uh, exactly, yes, she [ Sighs ] It was like she was reminding me that I wasn’t pregnant. I was just so pissed. I didn’t even thank her. [ Sighs ] God, I wish I could just go back and thank her. I had it all figured out. I was gonna have a baby. And a husband. And then he showed up.
[ Inhales sharply ] Reddington is. The bane of my existence. And yet, here he is, trying to reconnect with his daughter? Trying to find her? And I find myself feeling possessive.…
… Possessive of him, jealous of the girl he’s trying to protect. And if that’s not embarrassing enough, that’s exactly how he predicted I’d feel.♤
Carrie Ann Beck’s? That’s probably why she backed out, right? – Because of that baby.
And when they find a cure, when we walk out of here, it’ll all be because of that baby.
Poachers?
This is going to take some convincing. The FBI’s job is to protect people.
This is important to you.
Over the last few years, high-ranking poachers have disappeared without a trace from the  Jalloh and Yeboah clans, the Bholas in India, and the Rocha Cartel in Bolivia. Now, no one’s taken credit yet, but according to Reddington, the Mombasa Cartel is working to corner the illegal wildlife trade.
Four days ago, a dead body washed up south of Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Flayed and skinned with surgical precision, according to the local medical examiner.
Joseph Batouala – Kenyan, part of the Wanjiku Cartel, the alleged mastermind behind the 2013 elephant massacre at Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe. The park’s watering holes were dosed with cyanide, killing 300 elephants and thousands of other animals.
According to Reddington, these gangs are just small fish in a very big pond. By far, the most destructive is the Mombasa Cartel. [ Cellphone vibrates ] Reddington. I have to take this.
Who will be joining us? Bill Gates, Warren Buffett?
I’m sorry. I’m still getting past the whole “you’re buddies with Geoff Perl” thing.
And what does he do in return?
And when is this happening?
Uh, Trierweiler, right? Judy Trierweiler, aka “Elsa.”
I’ve had a hard time getting a toehold.
Mm.
I can handle myself.
Oh? What did his first one look like?
Just one access point Lee Chung, Emerson-Concorde Imports.
FBI. We were wondering if you wouldn’t mind assisting us in an investigation we’re conducting.
Nothing. You were late to work again. You seem a little edgy.
Chung’s business specializes in the importation of game meats and animal parts from endangered species. He’s willing to roll over on everyone else but claims he doesn’t know anything about the Mombasa Cartel.
Yeah. And the estimated fees Aram worked up.
Rocha Cartel?
Somebody’s poaching the poachers.
Thanks for the 24-hour reprieve. I met with Reddington yesterday.
I started to, but no, I didn’t.
I hope you understand I don’t have a choice.
After the bust, the whole thing imploded. By all accounts, the rest of the group were more or less hangers-on – Flakes, useful idiots.
Tell you what. How about I find someone to follow you around 24/7 and see how you like it?
Ezra’s not gonna talk.
Chung disappeared this morning. Somebody shot the agent surveilling him with a tranquilizer dart.
Possibly. We’re not sure. He might have fled. We flagged his passport. We’re tracking all international flights. We’ll keep you posted. At this point, the closest former Animal Underground members that we could find are in Anchorage.
Outside of one arrest for possession 15 years ago, they look clean.
Oh, yeah. And make a run out to Igaluk Ranch. It’s the former location of their commune. Property was picked up at auction after the big bust by Wendigo, LLC.
They were transported alive.
No doubt, but, still, customs, security – Someone would have – But, plus, how did they get onto a commercial flight without proper documentation?
Pull information on private jets departing the same days our victims were abducted. Crosscheck tail numbers. See if you can find a pattern.
Same pilots?
Who chartered the planes?
What do you know about a company called Wendigo, LLC?
Not sure. All we know is Wendigo controls chartered jets used in the abductions and they own a piece of property in the same area where the bodies were dumped in the ocean Sitka, Alaska. Used to be a commune for a group called Animal Underground. Ressler went up there to ask some questions. He’s fallen out of contact. Anchorage division’s scrambling HRT, and Samar and I are set to rendezvous with them in Juneau.
Any intelligence on who’s up there?
Anybody else?
“Something?”
Freeze!
No! [ Electricity crackles ] [ Skye and Matthew are electrocuted ]
To tell you the truth, I haven’t made a decision yet. [ Sighing ] The other day was close. I thought about telling Reddington. He’d know what to do. But the truth is, this is my responsibility – One way or the other.
You’ve given me pieces. You’ve helped around the margins, but I need more. I need Berlin!
The arms supplier – I want a name.
I want a name!
November.
That wasn’t so hard, was it? 
Uh, it was Dembe. He said Red had another case but he specifically asked that you come along.
Why would it?
I’m fine. My toes are fine.
Why did you want both of us here?
I don’t get it.
The Scimitar?
Uh, we need to talk.
Uh-huh. When’s the last time you used?
This happens all the time – agents taking meds to get over injuries and then they get hooked. It’s no big deal.
I want you to get help.
I got no problems with that.
I got your text. What’s the problem?
Zebra mussels. Did they go inside?
We have a meeting this afternoon. I brought you some warmer clothes.
Is that it now you’re, uh, concerned for my well-being?
We’ve been over this. You help me eliminate Berlin, and as far as I’m concerned, this whole thing is over. Until then, enjoy the view.
Sevan Volkov! Thank you for meeting with me.
Berlin. I know you supply him with arms shipments.
Tell me where to find him.
Thought you might say that, which is why I nominated you for our “Most Wanted” list. C.I.D.
So you can sit silent in a cell with an expensive attorney? Mm, I’d rather leave you out there, let the world know we’re looking for you. Once news of this hits the streets, Berlin will know the U.S. government is spending limitless resources and time looking for you a man who has intimate details about him and his business affairs. You have two options either you lead me to Berlin or I lead Berlin to you.
A C.I., someone the Bureau trusts.
Berlin killed Meera. He nearly killed Cooper. He put Tom into my life. So if you’re asking if I’m okay with a lethal outcome, damn right I am. Yeah.
But I did kill him.
Let me know when Volkov gets a time and location on Berlin.
No idea. But could this be the man they were surveilling? Jonathan Reese.
Is he okay?
My arm?
John Reese. The man who was in the car with us.
No, no, no, no, but he was in the car.
[Sighs] I need a phone. [Groans] Listen –
– That crash was no accident.
It’s me.
Yeah, I’m fine, but, uh Ressler he’s hurt. The Iranians have John Reese. I heard some men’s voices before I passed out. They were speaking Farsi. Someone needs to find Professor Collins. The D.O.D. needs to cancel that speech and put her in protective custody now.
Okay.
[Sighs] Yeah. What happened to Radiology? They were gonna take him for another scan.
[ Acting groggy ] No we need to get the radiologist now!
Okay. Oh, my gosh, I’m so sorry! I’m so sorry.
We need to get Radiology.
Thank you.
Hmm?
Thank you. What’s that? [ in the syringe ]
[Grunts] [Grunts] You tell me what’s in the syringe [Grunting] or I will stick it in you and find out for myself.
What’s in his I.V.? [Grunts]
 Okay, who are you? Where is this hospital?
Aah! [Gasping] Ressler? Ressler? Ressler? Ressler? Ressler? Can you hear me? We got to get the hell out of here! 
Collins is missing. Cooper thinks she’s still on site.
Sir?! Sir? Sir, don’t move! Hands where I can see them! Slowly!
I thought for a second we might lose you back there.
It was.
What about that? Is that gonna be a problem?
That’s him. Shot point-blank to the head. This was an execution. (♫ Rising up) Who would have done this? 
He gave us a location on Berlin. (♫ Oh, now the rain done come)  We’ll see how that pans out.
Yeah, well ( ♫ How do I bleed you?) when I make my decision, you’ll be the first to know.
No.
Please go. I’ll finish it. This is between us.
Hey! What happened to you? I went out front, and you were gone.
Yes. He’s dead.
Call Ellie.
It’s about Tom. It’s urgent.
You owe me.
He cannot die.
Steven, hey. It’s me. Uh, listen, uh your boat. Is it still sitting empty or did you find a buyer?
And he is responsible for Meera’s death. You were her C.I., and you told me – that if I found the man responsible –
I will. I just need you to babysit for a little while until I get some info.
Let’s get this straight. I did not save you because I care. I saved you because you have intel on Berlin. I want a name.
Oh, I don’t know, Tom. From where I’m sitting, you look like the bitch to me.
Why you? Have you spied on others? Is this what you do?
I want a name. What bank?
What about accounts, names of shell companies?
Did you murder Jolene Parker?
What do you know about Reddington?
What do you know about Reddington?
What do you know about Reddington?!
I asked you a question: Gina Zanetakos!
How often did you communicate with Berlin, his associates?
Tell me about the guests at our wedding.
If you want Ellie to look at that infection, you’re gonna have to answer my question.
I need a name!
What about the adoption?
Because I know the answer.
We agreed when this was over, I’d arrest him.
I am not a murderer.
Close that door. Keep him quiet.
All right.
Yeah. That’s why I’m here. FBI. We’re searching for two fugitives escaped from Cumberland last night. I cleared the boat, but they’re said to be in the area and armed.
Bureau would have reached out, but Homeland’s running point. Go figure. If you do see anything –
Yeah, you, too.
Dembe. Where is he? 
You’re working with Berlin?
What the hell is going on?!
Manipulated by who?
Berlin killed Meera, he put Tom in my life, and every time you have a chance to stop him, you let him go.
The man we’re looking for is known as The Decembrist. His acts are said to have contributed to the end of communism in Eastern Europe.
He tried to assassinate him during a meeting in Kursk and faked his daughter’s death.
In a coffee tin. Our guy copied that?
You found The Decembrist.
Reddington won't give us Berlin until we give him Morozov. At the very least, we should go there and question the man.
That's it? You're just gonna stand down on this?
es, sir. I'm sure he will.
I do, but this can’t come back on the task force. Are we clear? [Beep] Hold on. I’ll be right back.
The Decembrist. His real name is Kiryl Morozov.
iryl Morozov.
What the hell?!
Are you out of your mind?!
He’s got blood on him. What did you do? How are we supposed to –
Okay. Here’s what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna let him go. We’re gonna move Tom.
So let him talk. He says anything, it’s his word against mine. And he’s an informant.
No. I can fix this. I have a storage unit. We’ll wait till it gets dark. We’ll keep him here temporarily until we can find ano – no!
Tom, no! Tom, stop!
Next one goes in your chest! Tom, let him go!
Reddington called an hour ago. He believes Alan Fitch’s life is in danger.
He believes he’s the one who orchestrated the Kursk bombing.
What?
Who told you he’s alive?
[ Sighs ] Look, okay, I lied. But I only kept it a secret because I know you want him dead.
I’ve been using him as a source, and he’s been incredibly valuable.
Yes. And he disappeared.
Forget it.
I need information, not advice.
To find Berlin.
We’re looking for Fitch right now, and we’re gonna find him because of this.
He’s an informant, like Reddington.
Where? Where?
What address?
Actually, I think it fits four.
He brought us Fitch.
Don’t worry about it, Ressler. I’ll tell Cooper.
Yes.
Yes, we believe he does.
I didn’t need to.
We found Fitch because of Tom.
[ Sighs ] I couldn’t do it. I told you I could kill Tom, but after you left, I just – 
After all the lies and everything he did to me, I told myself I! was using him! — that I was finally in control. [ Sniffles ]
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
What do you mean?
Why not? Reddington’s our asset.
What if he didn’t?
You think it’s an intelligence apparatus that’s holding him?
The Factory? Wait, what’s The Factory?
We’ve got to get him out of there.
He’s our asset.
Braxton is a thief. Interpol’s been hunting him for years. He plans his heists to occur in the midst of chaos. He is organized, meticulous, and he is bloody.
Oh, we don’t have authorization.
What are you thinking?
He’s got an entire team in place.
[ Gasps ]
Or maybe I actually care about what happens to you.
From here? How? What’s he after?
I don’t know what that is. The Fulcrum– What is that?
And it’s here, this Fulcrum?
I can help you.
Ressler and Samar have been taken hostage.
Why didn’t you come to us? What aren’t you telling me? Why don’t you want me here?
This server room – where is it?
That would blow up the server room?
[ Sighs ] Looks like I’m the tunnel rat.
Yeah, I think I see it. I’m here.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
What happened?
 There’s nothing you can do to override it?
We can do this.
650 PSI. A few more, and the boiler blows. So, when are you gonna tell me the truth?
About why you came here– the blackmail file, the Fulcrum.
Why? What difference does it make to you if he gets it and exposes this–
So, if Braxton gets it, they’ll know you don’t have it, and they’ll kill you – is that it?
680. So that’s what this is about – this whole thing? Protecting yourself?
Lost how?
What does that mean, “Without me”? 
Red? Reddington?! Breathe!
He’s dead.
It’s over. The server’s destroyed.
[Gasps] My father! My father was there.
Where am I? Where are Agents Ressler and Navabi? Did they make it?
I don’t know anything.
[ Grunting loudly ]
[ Gagging ]
[ Coughing ]
Guys, there are people looking for me. If they find me, they’ll find you.
You don’t have to do this.
A little girl hiding.
Yes.
They’re shouting.
[ Gasps ] My father. My father was there!
Your son, what’s his name?
I’m sorry. I’m sorry you got dragged into this.
The girl, she called him “Daddy.”
The little girl stopped me. It’s like she has some kind of a secret. But I’m the girl.
I have no recollection of my mother or my father – not their faces, nothing. [ Sighs ] All I know –  or think I know – is that my father gave me this. [ shows her scar ]
It’s gonna be fine.
Something happened that night, something people are willing to kill to find out, and whatever it was involved my father. I’m not doing this for Braxton or for you. I’m doing it for me. I need to know the truth.
The closet.
They’re arguing.
Let me go! Get away from me!
[ Opens eyes, says to Red ] You were there. You were there, weren’t you?
There were people with the woman, looking for it. The Fulcrum. You were one of them.
But that’s why you were there. That’s why you came into my life then. And that’s why you’re here now. Not because of me or who I am to you, whatever connection we might have, but because of some object. Some thing.♤
What I remember is leaving my father dying on the floor of a burning house. [ Sniffles ] There’s no way he could have survived that.
My father was killed because of the Fulcrum, because you and your people came for it that night. Well, I want you to know something. This charade of you pretending to care about me was a waste of your time because I don’t know where it is.♤ [ Echoing ] Don’t! 
You said it was urgent?
So, what? What does that mean?
No. I’ve never been treated.
[ Scoffs ] I didn’t make it up.
Are you telling me I may never know what really happened that night?
What is it?
I think it contains some kind of message.
I need you to see if you can figure out what it is, how it works.
But none that I know and trust.
Yes.
So leave a message.
Then tell Cooper.
I know exactly how this works. You lie, say what you need to say to make me believe you actually care –
You’re after the Fulcrum. It’s why you’re here. Not to help me or protect me or whatever spin you’re selling today. Well, I’m not buying it. From this point on, there’s no reason for us to talk unless it’s about the work.
[ Reading ] “According to Uzbek authorities, Father Aleksandr Nabiyev, a local priest in the Tashkent Region of Uzbekistan”– You’re intrigued because a priest was kidnapped?
And you know who kidnapped this agent?
And you do business with this man?
So everybody wins. You help us rescue the agent, we eliminate a thorn in your side.
We have a list of over 30 victims.
Commander Kushan. I’m Agent Keen. This is Agent Ressler. On behalf of the Bureau, we appreciate your help.
All due respect, sir, an American citizen has been abducted.
We’re being watched.
What are you doing here?
It’s not safe. We just saw the CIA at the airport. They see you –
I don’t trust him.
If you know so much about Americans, you’d know that our government doesn’t pay ransoms to terrorists.
Yeah, well, I’ll tell you one thing. Whatever it was eating at Hanover’s flesh, it wasn’t just water.
Mr. Denisov, thank you for your willingness to talk to us. The Bureau spoke with Anneca Oil, and the good news is, they want to fix this.
What the hell are you doing?
You’re not really gonna negotiate for Denisov, are you? You’re the one who insisted that our interaction be strictly professional. You gave us this case to help us get the agent back, not represent the other side.
Only if someone can prove the truth. Anneca spends a fortune on lobbyists to make sure that doesn’t happen. Maybe we can contact the State Department, see if they can apply some pressure, try and clean up this mess.
I’m sorry. Who is this?
I’ve already said more than I can say. May I ask – Lieutenant Ames –  who reported him missing?
You told Ruslan the State Department was open to the idea of an inquiry.
You told him, and he’s not interested?
I didn’t come here for the baklava. I came here to talk about the negotiation.
What’s wrong?
When exactly did this happen?
Ressler, I think I’m in trouble.
I got a call from Metro PD. They’ve got a missing-persons case, the DC harbormaster. He showed up where I was holding Tom.
I didn’t kill him. I didn’t. It was Tom.
To protect me. I realize how insane that sounds. I met the harbormaster the first time he showed up and gave him my card, told him I was there searching for two fugitives.
To explain why I was there  I had no idea Tom would kill him. I tried to stop it.
There was someone.
Where have you been?
Did you talk to Denisov?
Burke’s dead, isn’t he?
Wait, wait. We can’t leave. Kushan’s doubled the guards outside. It’s too risky.
If this is true and Anneca is responsible for hundreds of people’s deaths, then you and the other high-level executives will be prosecuted.
Agent Burke. Welcome back.
I knew you had to have an angle.
You were having drinks together the day we arrived. You knew exactly what was gonna happen.
That’s why you wanted Anneca to abandon the pipeline, to clear the way for another company to get the contract?
You get a payday from Savillion for making it happen.
Did you find anything?
No.
You have to tell me – promise me you will not talk to Reddington about this.
DMV? Really? I’ve never even seen you drive.
The smiling public face of the militia movement. Who hasn’t? Yes.
Forget it.
Justice knows exactly who Justin Kenyon is. We know what he is. The Church of the Shield is a cesspool of polygamy, doomsday paranoia, ritualized elder and child abuse, but he also has four of the most prominent civil rights attorneys in the country on retainer – we can’t touch him.
His church has been audited by the IRS every year for the past decade. His books are impeccable.
Justin Kenyon – head of the Church of the Shield, a polygamist cult located on a 15,000-acre reserve in the Smoky Mountains.
According to Reddington, Kenyon has dozens of shipping containers buried on his property. Terrorists, cartels, and criminals contract with him to store cargo, no questions asked. Reddington compiled a partial inventory from his sources. It includes all manner of contraband, from drugs and hot merchandise to military ordnance, antiaircraft guns, missiles, RPGs, Semtex.
In 1982, Kenyon published a book entitled “The Silver Bear Prophecies,” which he purported were delivered to him by the spirit of an ancient Druid elder. In it, he claims to be the latter-day incarnation of an entity the Silver Bear called “The Ken’yon.”
Ken’yon and his followers will ascend into Heaven for six days and return to – and I quote – “Rain fire upon the New Babylon, the defiled States of America, and our children shall cleanse
I told you – there are political considerations. If we raid Kenyon’s compound and come up empty-handed –
But if we do, then we’ll have validated Kenyon’s allegations that the federal government are a pack of jackbooted thugs. We’ll have raised him up as a martyr for the Constitution. That’s exactly what he wants.
ATF estimates there was enough Semtex in that van to level five square blocks.
Sheriff, have you met Kenyon?
So, what are you suggesting – we collar this guy at the next rotary club pancake breakfast?
What are the odds we’ll be met with armed resistance?
Kenyon’s unaccounted for. …  Slaughtered. … No sign of him.
It appears all the adults were murdered and the children are gone.
They might have been attacked by a rival militia. We found a number of dead bodies surrounding the perimeter.
Located, secured, and searched – about a dozen of them so far. They’ve been pretty much cleaned out – no weapons, no ordnance. According to an inventory list, we’re missing small arms, RPGs, three Hellfire missiles, plus over a ton of Semtex, C4, Demex, and plastite.
What was that?
All the church’s vehicles are accounted for, except for one.
Tell me who you are. Who’s in charge?
I want to talk to him.
Where are the others?
And the man? Ressler? What have you done with him?
Go ahead. It’s what he wanted, isn’t it?
I know your father wanted you dead.
All those boys – they wouldn’t have made it if it weren’t for you, taking them in, teaching them how to survive. Your father never wanted them. He never wanted you. But you’re not your father, David. You’re better than him.
ATF’s been over the grounds. They’ve searched the buried containers. If you’re wondering about what you stored there, it’s long gone. [ Drawer closes ] What’s this?
Why?
[ Sighs ] I’m happy where I am. Thank you.
And you think a view is gonna change that?
Thanks, but, no, thanks. I wish you’d stop.
Trying. Stop hoping things are gonna get better between us. You and me, it’s just business. That’s all it’s ever gonna be.♤
What the hell?
I had no idea Tom would kill him.
My father was killed because of the Fulcrum, because you and your people came for it that night. … This charade of you pretending to care about me was a waste of your time because I don’t know where it is.
It’s not a souvenir, it’s a final act of domination. While his prey’s body is still warm, he carves out the liver and takes a single ceremonial bite.
I told you, I don’t know anything about it.
I’m not.
You’re not even interested in serial killers.
Wrong?
A woman? I disagree with you.
Richard Kuklinski was 6’5″, 300 pounds, and one of his favorite weapons of choice was cyanide.
Aileen Wuornos was a prostitute who lured her victims in with the promise of sex.
What is it?
That was him! He was at my lecture!
You’re obsessed with serial killers. You write about them all the time. How do we know you’re not The Deer Hunter?
What’s that supposed to mean?
We didn’t overlook that. He was learning, evolving.
Keen.
Yes, Detective. I remember you were looking into the disappearance of the DC harbormaster.
I’m sorry to hear that. I was hoping for better news.
I would like to, Detective, but as I told you, the reason I came into contact with the harbormaster- t-the case I was working on at the time – it’s classified.
Even if I wanted to answer your questions, before I could talk, you would need to get – A federal judge to rule that my investigation supercedes your case.
This conversation is over.
What? Nothing.
That cop, the one investigating the harbormaster? He’s got evidence. He found the body. And the witness.
I think he did, yes.
I’ve hidden behind the task force for as long as I can, told him I couldn’t talk because it was classified, but he’s taking the case to a federal judge.
But I was there. I should have –
They’ll have enough to arrest me.
What?
Two different bites at the proverbial apple. Nice work, Ressler. So, it’s official–  We’re looking for a copycat.
How long were the two of you married?
You tell him we’re gonna find whoever did this.
Actually, one in particular – we believe this may not be the work of the actual Deer Hunter. We think it’s a copycat.
No, it’s okay. She deserves to know. We’re getting closer to the truth.
No, thank you. We appreciate your time. I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.
She was covering. I don’t know what, but that woman knows something.
My profile is wrong. There was nothing specific connecting the original Deer Hunter’s victims other than the physical, but the copycat, his victims–
I had assumed he was operating like the original killer, but what if he chose those victims based on a different unifying reason? He could be masking his agenda by making it look like the work of a different serial killer. Well, maybe there’s something in the victims’ histories we missed.
Don’t know yet. But I rattled her. We should let her stew and take another run at her tomorrow.
So, they’re not connected, but something about them is?
Okay, so that’s two. What about the others?
Let me guess –
Yeah, but those women were in five different states. How did the killer even know they were in danger?
Bright – Bright Voice.
The only other thing those seven women have in common is your organization. It’s quite possible that the person committing these murders interacted with these women through Whitehaven. We’re gonna need a full list of your employees and volunteers of the last five years.
She called?
Look, if you’re here because you want to give me more unsolicited advice about my case –  Red: Tempting as that may be, I’m here to speak to Agent Mojtabai.
I’ll take the back.
ME won’t buy it. Victimology’s all wrong. The Deer Hunter killed men.
I understand. Maybe a jury will.
My God.
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
Okay.
But can you please, please just do me one favor?
Shut the hell up and get it over with.
You think I don’t know why you’re really doing this? You think I’m buying this whole “justice for victims” crap?
[ Chuckles ] You’re just like your husband.
You’re exactly like him, like all the sick, psychopathic animals we lock up.
I’ve heard every word [ Mockingly ] “I could give them back their lives.” [ Normal voice ] Why don’t you just admit it? You get off on killing people. It doesn’t matter if the victim’s a scumbag or a saint – you get off just the same, just like your husband.
Yeah. Fine. Back there, uh I can’t do this.
You’re kidding, right? I would have killed her if you hadn’t shown up.
Same as on the boat.
No. That man had a family. He had a life. I’m gonna go to Wilcox. I’m gonna tell him everything.
[ Sighs ] Please.
That doesn’t make it right.
Yeah. Fine.
Are you scolding me?
Killed.
What are you gonna do? Ground me? Take away my phone privileges?
And a woman. We were both half right.
I have the Fulcrum. Tell me what it is, and I’ll tell you where to find it.
I don’t need your protection.
What did you do?
I don’t want to hear any more. I’m leaving.
That is?
By all means, come right in. Make yourself at home.
What do you care? She almost got us both killed.
The kings? Of what?
So, what does this have to do with Madeline Pratt?
Pictures of the kidnapping.
Earl King and his two sons, Tyler and Francis –  from available intel, they appear to be an eccentric family of trust-fund billionaires. According to Reddington, they supplement their family fortune with profits from their illegal auctions. Six months ago, seized by MI5 disappeared from their evidence vault in Leeds. The painting – stolen from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Reddington claims both these items will fall under the gavel at the Kings’ next auction.
 Agent Keen.
The suspect’s name is Silvio Haratz. He’s using a safe house called The Palace. We’re on our way.
Forget it, Reddington. We’re not on your payroll, and you can’t call us off. We’re on it.
He informed us they used Pratt as bait, faked the kidnapping in order to bring Red into the Kings’ custody.
Let’s not focus on the Kings. Let’s focus on the Kings’ guests. Try and match the items we know they have for sale with the people who might be interested in buying them.
Alexi Koskov, a Russian oligarch with an extensive collection of stolen masterpieces. The Art Crime Division says he’s been trying to acquire the Van Gogh since it disappeared in 2002. Samar: Koskov’s on the no-fly list. How can he get into the country?
This is the Bureau’s file on you and your boss.
Koskov is untouchable. But you’re right here.
Everyone there is on their payroll.
That’s not necessarily true. They’re expecting an American named Josephine Sullivan. We can give them that.
If you can think of one, I’m all ears.
Keen.
What the hell are you doing calling me?
What’s her name?
Me?
What do you think? I’m in a lot of trouble because of you.
Berlin is out of commission, and you just get another gig?
I think the word you’re looking for is goodbye. Look, I got to go. It seems like the only thing we have in common anymore is pretending to be someone else.
Just a few hours.
Sneeze?
I always thought you just had allergies.
I have a reservation. Sullivan. Josephine Sullivan.
With a view.
I requested a view of the Capitol.
What is it?
How thoughtful.
Yes, I am. It’s rumored Van Gogh actually painted it at the beach, and up close, you can see the grains of sand bonded to the canvas.
[ Chuckles ] Columbia, then Princeton.
[ Sneezes ]
[ Sniffles ]
Is that who I think it is?
The Raymond Reddington. Impossible.
Unfortunately.
I’ve heard he’s far more trouble than he’s worth. It’s probably easier to let someone else buy him. Let him be their problem. I’m here for the Van Gogh. He’s probably out of my price range, anyway.♤
to young Vincent: Come on. Let’s go.
Excuse me. I’m looking for the Van Gogh. I paid a fortune for it.
We have to get these people out of here.
How do you open this thing?
You could be killed.♤ 
Vincent, I need you to run through that door. See it? Go as far as you can, okay?
Run. Go! Go! 
Okay.
You’re welcome.
We took down dozens of wanted criminals, recovered millions of dollars in stolen property, and saved innocent lives.
You. You’re talking about you. Wow. You are so damaged. You can’t accept help from anyone. Has anyone ever helped you? Is that why you are the way you are? Because you don’t feel deserving of it? Is that why you can’t be vulnerable for a second? I risked my life for you because I care about you.♤ Deal with that. [ Pause, then: ] And when someone does something nice, you’re supposed to say, “Thank you.”  [[ You too, Lizzie ]]
You’re welcome.
Hey. Aram said you were looking for me.
What’s going on?
I can’t.
You’re right. I didn’t tell Wilcox the truth. But I am telling you the truth when I say I didn’t kill anyone. Look, Meera was dead. You were in the hospital. I did what I thought was necessary to stop Berlin. That’s all I’m willing to say.
Thank you.
Yes, Your Honor.
Elizabeth Scott Keen. I’m a special agent for the FBI.
My assignment is classified.
I’m part of a black-book task force that investigates cases brought forward by a criminal informant.
Your Honor, with all respect, I can’t divulge the name –
Raymond Reddington.
Yes.
It was a cover.
He was captured. We helped him escape.
Which is why what we do must remain a secret. If criminals knew Reddington was working with the FBI, then he would be of no value.
[Thirty.]
I – I’ve been a profiler for 18 months.
The FBI didn’t pick me, and I didn’t want to have anything to do with it.
I thought we were here to talk about Eugene Ames.
No. He sent a helicopter.
I had a very simple life. A husband I loved, a dog. It was my first day on the job. And suddenly, I was flying over restricted airspace. They sat me down with Deputy Director Harold Cooper.
I’m sorry, what does this have to do with what happened with Mr. Ames?
That is true, but you don’t need all these details to determine –
With Ames?
[ Machinery whirs ] I’d never been so terrified. We’d studied him at Quantico His crimes, his profile. But when we sat down, he spoke as if he knew me.
I had no idea what he expected.
Of course I did.
Well, he had intel. He said a girl was going to be taken, a general’s daughter. We had to act. And since he would only talk to me –
He insists upon it.
Like I said, no one believed me.
Yes.
They’re not gonna hurt you, honey. I’m gonna find you. [ End Flashback ]
With Reddington’s help, we were able to save her and prevent an attack on D.C. But the cost was Tom. All I wanted was my life back, but Reddington had other plans. He told the deputy director that he had a list of criminals he could help us find, and that was only the first.
He told us, if we cut him a deal, that he could help us capture the kinds of criminals the FBI can’t find because we don’t know they exist.
No.
Because it turns out, they weren’t. They weren’t false. He knew things about me – Things I didn’t even know. About my husband at the time. Whatever connection he thought we had, whatever history he was implying we shared, I didn’t care.
He wanted me for a reason And I wanted to know why.
Tom Keen – The man I married, he was a fiction. He didn’t exist.
That’s impossible.
Because Tom Keen died four months before Mr. Ames was killed.
No.
Because I killed him.
My ex-husband. Yes. I shot him in self defense.
The man that I married He was perfect.
He [was] kind, smart, a teacher.
Or so I thought. They say love is blind. I certainly was.
To the fact that our entire relationship was a lie, that my husband was a spy. The only reason he was with me was because of my connection to Reddington.
I didn’t know about it, but others did.
Sort of. I had to find out for myself.
I spied on him. Interrogated the people in his life, tried to find out who he worked for.
Not before he realized that I knew.
It was heated. [ Flashback to their fight ]
I didn’t murder him. His boss, Berlin, he ordered Tom to abduct me. Use me as leverage to get to Reddington. I had a gun to my head. That’s why I shot him.
What is?
What difference does it make?
No, you’re calling me a murderer.
You’re implying that my allegiance is as much with Reddington than with the task force.
He’s my C.I., and if you want to air that out in open court, go right ahead, but do not question where my loyalties lie!
[ Sighs ] I told you. He has a list.
You’d be surprised.
There was a man named Milton Bobbit who devised an ingenious way to turn terminally ill patients into assassins, all while working as an unassuming insurance adjuster. The Courier moves high-value commodities under his skin. The Alchemist makes people disappear by changing their DNA.
That’s what we thought.
He keeps us busy.
It won’t, but people will die. They already have. The black site where we operate from – There was an incursion. [ Flashbacks: ] [ Explosion ] [ Gunfire ] A mole leaked the information about what we do, and as a result, an extraction team was sent to abduct Reddington. He barricaded himself in. He wouldn’t come out, and the team made good on their threat to kill innocents until he did.
Except one.
Me. He agreed to come out when they put a gun to my head. After that, Reddington vanished. He wouldn’t come back into the headquarters – until the mole was found.
We don’t know for sure, but Reddington only returned after the disappearance of Diane Fowler.
I don’t know for sure.
Well There was a time early on when I thought, because of his implications, that he might be my father.
No. He died in a fire.
She died when I was young. The man who raised me, my adoptive father, his name was Sam Milhoan.
Yes.
I- I don’t know.
Yes, Reddington was there when my father died.
I didn’t say they were close.
Wait, why?
It’s not a story. This is the truth.
Yes.
Wait! Wa- I don’t I don’t want to take a break. I would like to finish and go home.
He calls it the Blacklist.
There is no physical list. The names are all in Reddington’s head.
No, I- I don’t believe so. I believe that each case, each criminal is somehow part of a larger agenda.
I can’t be sure, but he always has an angle for every case. I know that.
No. W-well, yes.
I wasn’t at first, but as it turns out, the cases he brings us are far more valuable to national security than what he gets in return.
At first, I thought the cases were all about getting Berlin.
And most of them were. And, yes, he’s using us. It’s true. But in the process, we’ve been able to capture and kill a number of high-value targets, including Berlin. And I thought that was the end game, but as it turns out, Reddington has other agendas.
I can’t know for sure, but, yes, I imagine they’re connected. Like his recent arrest in Hong Kong.
He wanted to be captured. It’s all a part of his quest to find something he calls “The Fulcrum.”
It’s a blackmail file. And before you decide whether or not to discuss what we know in open court, you should know that, according to Reddington, the Fulcrum is proof of the existence of a clandestine organization, and if its activities were made public, a number of very powerful people would go to prison or be executed.
We don’t know if what Reddington alleges is true, and until we can confirm his allegations, until we find the proof, the only people who would benefit from the Fulcrum being publicized are the criminals it identifies.
No.
Yes. Through me.
That’s what I’ve come to believe is the real reason he surrendered in the first place, – asked for me.
Absolutely.
I’m sorry. You’re right. You’re absolutely right. [ Emotionally ] I should have known that when my husband and I were planning family that he was, in fact, a traitor who had installed surveillance cameras in my bedroom! Of course I should have been aware that the number four on the FBI’s most wanted list would turn himself in and demand to speak only to me! God, what a horrible profiler I must be to have missed the fact that I am central to the discovery of a blackmail file that will tilt the balance of power in – Let me phrase this right – The entire world! Wow! I suck!
I never said Cumberland, and I was only looking for one man Samuel Aleko. He had a warrant out for his arrest, and I had reason to believe that he was hiding out on the Phoenix.
In his statement – Which he recanted.
That’s not true.
Tom, stop! [ End Flashback ]
As I told you, my ex-husband is dead.
Perhaps I should remind you that the only evidence against me is circumstantial.
If I were holding my ex-husband hostage and Mr. Ames found him, the last thing Tom would do is kill him, the one man who could alert the authorities and set him free. It makes no sense. Yes, it’s my word against his.
Good. I have no doubt that Deputy Director Cooper will confirm my accounts.
My ex-husband is dead.
Looks like a bullet.
Why are you showing me this?
I sat right here and told you exactly what happened. Maybe Wilcox is fabricating evidence to support his case.
I did not kill Eugene Ames. That’s the only truth you need to know.
[gets off elevator, sees Red & Res] What’s going on?
Can we talk? ⋘⋙ What are you doing?
Finding Tom will not keep me safe. I lied to the court.
How? Judge Denner’s right. I covered it up. At the very least, I’m an accessory after the fact.
It’s my fault. I never should have put him there. He’ll go to prison for the rest of his life because of me.
He’s not gonna come back.
Yes, Jeff, I understand you’re my financial planner, but I’m not asking for your advice on this.
Sir, I was just coming …
Sir –
I’m sorry, sir. I never wanted –
I’m not sorry for what I did, but I am sorry that it had to be done. I wanted Berlin dead. I wanted him to pay for what he did to Meera, to you, to all of us. I brought Tom to that ship for us.
Sir, you’re bleeding.
Oh! Sir! I need help in here! 
[ At hospital ] Dr. Harper. I’m Agent Keen. I was with Director Cooper when he was brought in.
Yes, is that what that was? He seemed fine, – and then all of a sudden, his nose,–
Oh, my God.
This is Dr. Harper. This is Mrs. Cooper.
He was with me. We were arguing.
Any word?
Well Charlene, the last thing I want to do is pry, but Dr. Harper mentioned his “condition.” Charlene: Harold’s a private man. … Harold has a brain tumor. Glioblastoma, it’s called. Doctors found it last year when he was admitted after being attacked. They suggested that he leave the Bureau. Any undue stress could exacerbate his illness. But – but Harold, that– that job It means everything to him.
I’m so sorry. I had no idea.
No, I understand. This stays between us. You have my word.
[ Knock on door ] Hey. I just saw Charlene. She said it was okay.
[ Laughs ] You might have if you hadn’t missed the corner of my desk on your way down.
I wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for you. I mean, I certainly couldn’t have survived the last year and a half without you. You’re the only person in the world I completely trust.♤mAnd to hear you say that you don’t even recognize me –
Maybe it should have ended. Maybe he’s right.
[ to Connolly ] What’s gonna happen to Tom?
My ex-husband, Tom Keen?
Yes. And the scholarship, it’s anonymous, correct?
Thank you.
Eugene Ames was 67 years old. The only reason he was still working was to get his daughter through college.
You knew about Tom – that if he came back they’d exonerate him to protect the task force.
Keen.
The judge cleared you of everything.
I can’t.
[ Sternly ] Tom–
Goodbye, Tom.
What’s this?
What?
Of course. I- I remember. Along the garden fence, we would pick– Is this from–
[ Sighs ] 31! No offense, but that’s old.
I haven’t heard of it.
The tech billionaire?
You know Roger Hobbs personally?
The suspect’s still missing, but they found mutilated bodies in the back of the truck.
On innocent victims.
How many employees?
All doing research on immortality?
There is speculation that some of your employees might have thought it was time for human trials.
We’ll need a list of all of your researchers.
Thank you for your time.
What kinds of cells?
Bizarre
Who would abduct a defenseless, disabled man and subject him to such cruelty? 
Are you saying he was abducted?
I imagine you must have some security measures in place. Would you be able to provide us with a list of people who had access to the facility the day he disappeared?
And where was William last seen?
May I talk to John Paul?
Looks like a good hand you’ve got there. I’m Elizabeth. I’m with the FBI. I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about William Eckhoff? You were with him when he disappeared, am I right? The people I work with– we’re looking for him. Is there anything you can tell us? Did you see anything? [ he shoves King of Diamonds card at her ] Was there anyone else there with you that we could speak to?  [ shoves King of Diamonds closer to her ] Thank you for your time.
No. You?
[ Looks at log ] Hmm. “Gold Crown Pharmaceuticals.” Lloyd Munroe.
[ On phone ] Hey, guys, what you got?
Aram, the suspect.
Lloyd Munroe. That’s got to be our guy. That can’t be a coincidence.
Get the local PD on the line. Tell them they need to stop that bus.
You don’t know that for sure.
No.
I don’t even know where he is.
[ To Lloyd Munroe ] You know what this is? It’s the ballistics report that proves the gun you had on you was the same one used to murder that cop. Killing a police officer is a capital offense. That makes you eligible for the death penalty.
We want the people you work for. Give them to us, and we’ll talk to the US Attorney, recommend a life sentence. You do enough, you might even get the possibility of parole.
If you’re lying–
Dr. Maynard.
We should get those files over to Aram as quickly as possible.
They look identical.
So Powell is using these jellyfish to conduct experiments on human brains.
He dropped off the face of the Earth.
Oh, uh, yeah, I’m gonna go to Wing Yee’s with a few friends. [ Laughs ] No big deal.
Thanks. You’re sweet.
[ To Hobbs ] We don’t see a lot of billionaires suspected of murder.
This is one hell of a coincidence, Mr. Hobbs. We come around asking about human experiments, and when we find the man responsible, he has a direct connection to you.
We’ve got straight denial. He’s pretty much calling our bluff.
If he is directly connected to Powell and we let him go, the first thing he’s gonna do is destroy the evidence. We should hold him.
Let him file. By the time he gets heard, we’ll probably have what we need.
Maybe we can’t connect Hobbs directly with the victims, but I have a feeling Dr. Powell can. All we have to do is find him.
We need you to escort us to Leann McGrath’s room immediately.
Reddington!
“The car Ms. McGrath was riding in jumped a center divide and hit an oncoming tractor trailer. Officers at the scene said Ms. McGrath’s car was being driven by her fiancé, Julian Powell.”
He’s not looking for immortality. He’s trying to bring back the woman he loves.
Care to tell me what the hell happened today?
You stole Powell out from under us, and then an hour later, he ends up dead? Did you kill that man?!
You gave us this case because you wanted Powell, and then you used us to flush him out.
“Yes.” You wanted the science.
He wanted to get his fiancé back.
That’s half the truth. I don’t take anything you say at face value.♤
Roger Hobbs is a murderer. He may not have conducted those experiments, but according to the law, he is just as guilty, and now without Powell, we can’t prove it.
Hey. What are you still doing here?
I just didn’t feel like going out.
You said earlier that I had so much to celebrate. You know that isn’t true. I mean, I thought by the time I was in my 30s, I’d have something to show for it. I would at least be a prestigious profiler. I mean, I was the top in my class. I thought I’d have a loving relationship with someone, maybe we would be raising a family together.
I don’t know who I am. I don’t know if this is my birthday. I don’t even know my own name. No, I know who I am. I am the puppet of some high-functioning sociopath. I don’t even know what I’m doing here.
[ Laughing ] What did you–
I’ve been saving this for a special occasion.
What are you doing?!
What you’re asking me to do – I appreciate that you turned yourself in. You came back for me.
I can’t. I just can’t.
They’re not just passports. You put them in a box under the floor in our home. They represent everything I’m trying to forget.
They’re locked up in evidence.
I’m not gonna walk into evidence and steal them for you. Why would I do that?
You need to leave. Go. Now.
I came home, and Tom was here.
He is not in my life.
I don’t have to imagine.
Toshiro Osaka – A Japanese entrepreneur indicted in 2009 and knifed to death by an aggrieved business partner. Miles Chapman – He was gunned down in Algiers while avoiding extradition for insider trading. Lester Charles Conway – His Ponzi scheme was so massive, he’s now serving up to 30 years.
According to Reddington, they’re innocent – Framed after months, sometimes years of planning by a woman with a deep-seated hatred for the 1%. She doesn’t just take their money, she takes their reputations, their freedom, sometimes their lives. Her latest mark was Declan Salinger, a flamboyant venture capitalist who specialized in biotech. He was found last night in a hotel bathtub, needle on the floor, dead from an apparent overdose. His personal laptop was taken into evidence. CSI uncovered corporate withdrawals in excess of $27 million.
We spoke to your attorneys, Mr. Conway. You claim to have been framed by a woman named Claudia Sanchez.
We want to believe you. We do. Tell us what happened.
The lawyers interviewed as much staff they could find, but no one could or would positively I.D. the woman Conway alleges framed him. Two different cases, two sets of professional investigators, and this woman didn’t leave a trace.
Excuse me?
And what happened to Vanessa?
Take your time.
How did she do that?
What is?
You mean “shell” corporation?
Samar, you said these corps are being sold to criminals. If we could find the person who sold them to Cruz –
I need you to put me in touch with someone who brokers shelf corporations.
Our ghost has a name Vanessa Cruz. If I can find the person who brokered her–
I know how much it means to you.
And you know how much it means to me to know what part I play in all of this. But you told me it’s a blackmail file, and I’m a federal agent. I can’t just hand over information to you that might give you leverage over people who, for all I know, run our government.
This is about Tom, isn’t it?
It’s me. I need your help.
The case I’m working on – Our perp funneled money through a shelf corporation called Minnetonka Bankers Health & Life. Now, I’m sure you must know people who provide these types of services to people like –
Yes, to people like you.
I told you, if you help me with this case, I would get you those passports. My relationship with Reddington is not up for discussion. What we need to talk about is the case.
Now, these are two other shelf corps our unsub set up.
Andrusia Industries, Middle Leaf Properties
All three of those shelf corps are named after Minnesota lakes. When I was sifting through your lies, I found the shelf corp where you had the money parked Berlin was paying you Owasso Inc, also a Minnesota lake.
No, I’ll talk to your contact.
I’m more like his ball and chain.
[ On phone ] Ressler, I’ve got a mailing address for Cruz.
He’s not my buddy. And you are worse.
I think he’s more dangerous than you give him credit for. But he has a moral code. I don’t like it, but at least I know what it is, and it does not include lying to me.
No.
A boat?
You don’t even know how to swim.
Thank you.
Isn’t that what you do for a living?
Can you be honest? You have to be honest. Tom. Our entire marriage, everything that happened – Our fights, the baby – Your laugh. It couldn’t have all been pretend. You’re not that good an actor. [ Tom chuckles ] That’s why I didn’t see it, because so much of it was real.♤ You are my greatest failure as a profiler.
Can you be honest about the passports?
They’re real – Government issue. Where’d you get them?
I guess not.
That’s not how the truth works. You don’t get to pick and choose.♤ Not if you want to learn how to swim.
That was goodbye.
Before you made your fortune in the private sector, you worked in the division of corporate finance at the S.E.C.
Tell us about Hernando Cruz.
Don’t look so depressed. Today’s your lucky day. We found out who framed you.
So you were a part of a conspiracy, and when Cruz tried to go against you, he was murdered – Thrown off a bridge to keep him from blowing the whistle. That’s when you framed him, which is why she framed you.
If Cruz went to his boss, like you said, why was it never reported?
– Or he’s being catfished. You said she was his assistant?
Radio security! Have them lock down the hotel! And call an ambulance! Ressler! 
You wanted to see me?
[ Sighs ] We lost her.
[ Pointing to his cane ] This here – And you there? You have no idea how happy that makes me.
Sir?
I got your message. What is this place?
Tom, what are you still doing here?
I don’t understand.
I just spent the last 42 hours dealing with a man who is a lifelong habitual, pathological liar.
Yes. Tom.
Don’t give me advice. This man, this liar, he told me something – Something that I need you to confirm. Now, before I ask, I want you to understand that I expect you to give me the dignity of a yes or a no. Do you understand?
No. No, you cannot explain. Here. [ Gives him the Fulcrum ] This is all you wanted. Now you have it.
I said please do not attempt to explain why. I don’t care why. I just want this to stop. I want it all to stop, right now. Take it!
No!♤
Dembe!
Reddington! 
I have the Fulcrum. Tell me what it is, and I’ll tell you where to find it.
Here. [ Gives him the Fulcrum ] This is all you wanted.
Dembe! 
What you’re asking me to do – I appreciate that you turned yourself in. You came back for me.
I can’t. I just can’t.
They’re not just passports. You hid them in a box under the floor in our home! They represent everything I’m trying to forget.
They’re locked up in Evidence.
I’m not gonna walk into Evidence and steal them for you – Why would I do that?
You need to leave. Go. Now. 
You have eyes?
We got to get him out of here.
[ On phone ] Cooper, this is Keen. Reddington is down. I repeat, he is down – shot and critical.
Euclid and Drake, headed southwest.
Reddington, stay still. He’s shot in the chest. I’m gonna lose him if I don’t get him to an ER.
No, University.
Unknown, but I’m gonna need an escort and backup.
What are you doing?
What?
Who is this?
Mr Kaplan?
Capitol and M. [ To Dembe ] I don’t know what Mr Kaplan has planned, but we need to get him to a hospital right away.
I’m sorry, but we don’t have a choice. I’m not gonna let him die, and it can’t wait.
Mr. Kaplan?
5312 Mass Avenue. Who will?
Hold on. Please. Just hold on.
Caul?
Reddington’s in surgery.
We’re in a warehouse – 5312 Mass Avenue. He has some sort of mobile crash team.
Reddington gave me a name.
Leonard Caul.
He must know something about the people who organized the hit.
Whoever they are came after Reddington because they thought he had this device, the Fulcrum. It’s a blackmail file on a group, this cabal. He told them he had it, and he didn’t. And they finally called his bluff and tried to kill him, and they will not stop until they do.
According to Dembe, before Fitch died, he told Reddington to find Caul, that he would have information about the Fulcrum, the cabal. Reddington asked Aram to trace a call to an apartment, but when they got there, Caul was gone. All they found was blood – no body.
Protective detail.
No, we’re not –
What the hell?!
 How long before we can– What’s his status?
His status, what is it? Can he be moved?
I need a definitive answer. We have to go now.
So do it.
Does anyone here have surgical training?
You’re up, Fresno.
They’re coming.
You have 15.
Nick, please.
I wouldn’t ask if I had any other choice.
I had another doctor.
I can’t.
Listen to me– a man is going to die if you don’t help us. I’m begging you.
What are you doing here?
I didn’t know where else to go.
And who dispatched the detail?
That must be where the leak came from.
A safe house.
Reddington’s team is here. We’re secure.
He’s– I don’t know for sure, but it’s bad.
I need you to find Leonard Caul. ⋘⋙ I thought you’d be gone.
He’s not a part of this. He’s just a doctor.
It doesn’t matter if he’s bad. What matters is he has answers about me, and I’m staying until I get them.
I doubt that.
What about the bullet?
Can you do it or not?
Can you do it?
This is about the Fulcrum.
I do.
That’s why Reddington wanted us to find Caul, because he can decipher the Fulcrum.
He’s gonna be okay…?
Hey, sweetheart. Hi, kitty.
I won’t take you to Reddington.
You tried to kill him in the street today, at the warehouse.
You’re Leonard Caul.
What’s your connection to Reddington?
When someone tried to kill you?
He was shot earlier today.
He knew you’d be watching.
[ Sighs ] Tell me what you know about the Fulcrum.
Smartest person I know couldn’t figure out how to read this.
How did you get it?
Some of the names on that list, people, they’re CEOs, Defense contractors, intelligence officers from China, India, all over the world.♤
You worked for Fitch.
The Director?
Wait– are you telling me the director of Clandestine Serv–
Keep driving.
Keep driving.
[ On phone ] We’re compromised.
You’re surrounded.
We’re close. I don’t know how many, but they’re coming, and you need to be ready. Reddington– what’s his condition?
I’m calling for backup. 
3295 Thompson. Our site’s been compromised. I don’t know by who, and right now I don’t care, but Reddington’s inside, and he can’t be moved. I need you to send units now.
We need to go back.
We have to go back and help.
They’re going to kill Reddington. They’re gonna kill everyone. I-I can’t just walk away.
What does that mean?
That’s it.
Well, then you’re gonna have to read about this in tomorrow’s New York Times.♤
The Fulcrum. You didn’t think Reddington had it. Well, here it is, and it tells quite a story –  political assassinations, terrorism. We know who you are, what you’ve done.♤ You called Reddington’s bluff, and you lost. Call it off.
Pick up the phone right now and call it off.♤
I’m afraid I do.♤ You can keep that. We have copies. [ Turns to leave ]
Saw what?
We’ve cleared a wing at Sibley Memorial for you and your medical team. Cooper will oversee your security personally.
Don’t. There’s nothing you can say.
Is that all of it?
Why couldn’t you just have said yes? It wouldn’t kill you to lie just once to make someone feel good.♤
[ Breathes deeply ] I think you’re right. [ Voice breaking ] Reddington – What happened today I think it’s gonna devour me.♤
You said you could help me find answers.
Tell me what you know about Reddington.
I had the photo enhanced. It’s a rough extrapolation of features since the face was almost entirely blown out. I ran it through every FBI database from facial recognition, mug shots, surveillance feeds –
Do you know how many images are in the NGI database? –
– and not a single one of her.
I know who she is. That girl – That’s me. And the woman I believe that may be my mother.
No. My father died when I was 4, in a fire. Reddington was there. I think she may have been, too.
If Reddington wanted me to know the truth, he would have told me by now. He wants to keep me from knowing, and he will bully anyone who might help me into silence.
What?
Where?
You know people who worked with Berlin. You could reach out.
[ Walking up lawn ] Swanky digs.
Dembe asked me to go to get the interface for the Fulcrum.
[ Indicating folder on table ] What’s that?
[ Groans ] Identification documents for Lien Mah. Fake birth certificate. Fake passport. Death certificate. Proof of embalming.
Who would ship a fictitious Chinese corpse to China?
So, if Lien Mah is fake, then whose body are they shipping overseas? [ Reading ] “Marjorie Lin, 24, was laid to rest Monday afternoon. Not 10 hours later, her body was stolen in a brazen midnight grave robbery.” You think the smuggler is using Marjorie Lin’s body?
Same woman. But why this case? What’s your angle?
The Cabal?
You want to target one of their assets? I went to the Director, showed him the Fulcrum, restored the détente.
Based on this guy’s track record, there’s a good chance he was moving explosives in those caskets.
I just heard from Reddington. Uh, he wants to meet.
He won’t say. He’s still worried about leaks. I’ll have to catch up with you later.
Let him go!
You okay?
I believe he was asking for a name.
You swore to whom?
Son of a bitch.
[ Scrounging around Red’s secret flat ] Where is it? I know it’s here. That’s how you knew I was here, how you knew I saw the picture. It’s why you threatened people.
[ In Red’s flat. ] Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?
[ Speaks into camera ] Hello, Mr. Kershaw.
I saw your name on the mailbox. I know you’re listening. You know how I know? Because this is where you keep all of your secrets. And you don’t want anyone finding those out, do you? Well, unless you answer my questions, I’m gonna find every last one.
What was her name?
The girl – The night of the fire, they called her Masha.
You said she died of weakness and shame.
You were there that night. I need to know what happened.
Dr. Orchard told me someone blocked my memory of that night. Was it you?
Why?
You have a picture of my mother in your weird, little apartment. Why? Were you in love with her? Is that why my father died? You killed him because you were in love with my mother ♤ Tell me what happened. Please.
Then I’ll find out for myself.
Reddington said that the smugglers facilitated several terrorist incidents in the past. He had to have been transporting something in that casket.
Their teeth are different.
No. But I did.
FBI. Hands where I can see them.
Well, what are the paper dolls for?
And that explains the veneers.
They’re gonna steal another body.
What? [ Gasps ] There must be over $100,000 in this case.
Uh, the parents must blame her for Jin’s suicide. They’re determined to make An Bai his bride, if not in life, then in death.
You were in a fire?
To an organization some call the Cabal.
We’re not wrong. We know you were contracted.
Karakurt? Who is that?
Look, last night, me coming by your place like that and –
Don’t, please. I mean, can’t you just tell me about your boat? I mean, whatever the other thing is, I’m sure that it’s probably best for both of us if you just keep it to yourself.
Tom, we’re way past that.
What’s the catch?
Hope?
That what, we’ll just work through this screwed-up situation we’re in and go back to playing house?
Uh-huh.
[ Scoffs ] Be serious.
That’s insane. I don’t know you – not the real you. And the fact that you think I’m gonna run away with whoever you are means that you don’t know me at all, either.
Thank you.
Just because I’m eating this–
The Neo-Nazi? ‘Cause that doesn’t really do it for me.
[ Cellphone vibrating, Liz looks at screen ]  Reddington.
Tom.
I have to go.
There’s something I want to make clear with you.
It’s not enough for you to tell me that my mother was KGB and that I was born in Russia.
My mother and my father, who they are, what happened in the fire– I’m gonna find out the truth.
I get it. The Cabal is trying to start another Cold War, and an act of terror committed here is step one in making that happen. I am listening to what you are saying, and I know that it’s important, but it is no more important than what I am telling you, and I need you to listen to that!♤
January, 2009– Stanislav Markelov, a celebrated human-rights lawyer known for his criticism of the regime is gunned down in Moscow. The Russians blamed Neo-Nazi youth. But German intelligence suggests it was Karakurt acting on orders from the SVR. Four years later, Boris Berezovsky, another vocal critic of the regime, was found dead of an alleged suicide. Again, intelligence sources indicate the death was staged by the Kremlin.
No, that’s what the Cabal wants us to think. Whatever Karakurt was sent here to do, the American government will believe that it was on behalf of Russia. It’s a false-flag operation meant to strain relations.♤
No. But I think he might have a lead. He’s just being tight-lipped about it.
Reddington doesn’t trust our security. He thinks we’ve been bleeding information since before the attempt on his life.
A high-level informant. One who’s proven very reliable.
Look, you have your hooks in the Russian community.
He’s here. And we have reason to believe he’s planning an attack on American defense installations soon. If civilians die because you’re bent out of shape whether the source was FBI or CIA–
No. We asked for your help. If he’s here, where does he go? Who does he meet with? He needs a place to stay, a vehicle.
Hey. Can you help me with something? [ Shows him photo ] Katarina Rostova – you heard of her?
Why do you say that?
You said your CI works with the Old Guard. Could you ask him about her for me?
Reddington didn’t give it to me. I found it in one of the places he stays.
I don’t know. That’s what Reddington told me. But that girl, that is definitely me. The agent back there, the CI he mentioned? That could be my chance to find out something about the woman holding me in that photo.
Keen.
No, but those agents– their entire section. Every agent on that desk was wiped out. If this gets traced back to Russia–
Where? Nowhere. The Cabal just took out an entire substation of the CIA. They put a bullet in your chest, and you have no idea how. You’re the most cautious person I know. The FBI couldn’t find you for 20 years, but they did.♤ They’re three steps ahead, and that’s exactly what I’m gonna tell the AG.
No, he’s on his way. I assume he’s expecting to be briefed.
All we have on Karakurt is a recording and a grainy photo that’s gotten us nowhere.
Like what?
Reddington has a location for Karakurt–
I’ve got eyes. Going through Gate D.
[ Dazed ] Yeah. I’m okay.
He blind-sided me.
I didn’t see.
I don’t know. He came around the corner. I-I just got a glimpse of him. I was calling Ressler for backup when he knocked me down.
What does he mean by “Markers”?
And you think he was meeting with Karakurt?
I’ve seen equipment like this at the lab at Quantico. This is a genotyping unit.
This guy’s a virologist. If these are biological weapons, then we may be looking at a pandemic.
We found a fully outfitted virology lab in Andropov’s apartment. Think he’s building a bio-weapon. We seized his notebooks, but we’re gonna need an expert in microbiology who can also translate Russian.
I’ve got a lead on my mom. An Orea agent, he has a CI who might know something about Katarina Rostova.
I’m gonna find out the truth.
A WMD?
But who?
So, we know Karakurt is targeting one person and it’s keyed to his or her DNA.
He’s high-value. Someone important.♤ [ Gasps ] Oh, my God, that’s why he did it. The Memorial Service. The victims will be memorialized at a service at Ascension and Saint Agnes Church. Politicians and military personnel, intelligence officers from overseas will all be there to pay their respects. One of them is the target.
We need your people to be on high alert.
No, we’ll be prepared for that possibility, but our intel says he’s after a specific target. We just don’t know who yet.
There’s Defense, Homeland, CIA, the Bureau on this list. It’s gonna be hard to narrow it down.
I’ll check the drive-ups. Any word from Metro?
Get him away! Get him away from us! Come with us, sir!
We’ll explain everything, sir. Right now, we need to get you to a secure location.
Sir?
Sir! We need to get him to a hospital now! He’s been infected! Sir! 
Karakurt. That means “Spider,” right?♤
We have a recording of you and Andropov. We know he engineered a drug designed to kill the Senator. We know you’re infected.
You didn’t touch the Senator. How was the virus delivered?
Was this the plan all along, to protect you with this identity?  The Cabal has people in the government all over the world. It wouldn’t be hard for them to create a Jonas Flemming, give him a history.
Hey, I got to call you right back.
Why? Where are you? What’s going on?
I don’t have the virus.♤
I’m being framed.
Anyone could have infected Hawkins. He must have shaken dozens of hands at that memorial.
You can’t know that. This is insane.
They won’t find anything.
If I run, it’ll only make me look guilty. I’ll be playing right into their hands.
No. They can’t prove I did anything wrong. They can call me a criminal, but I’m not gonna act like one.
[ On phone ] You were right. [ Sighs ] It’s all set up. Cooper and Connolly – I heard them arguing. He’s got it all figured out. He’s presenting evidence, using my mother, making it seem like all I’ve been doing is helping you commit crimes.
I’m leaving now.
Yeah.
I want the chain of custody for that sample fully accounted for, and I want someone from my task force to oversee the process and confirm the results.
You need to listen to me. I’m being framed.
Yes, and so did my partner! At no point was I ever anywhere near that truck!
That’s not possible.
I’m sure that’s what the report says, because, as I told you, I’m being framed.
There’s an organization known as The Cabal– a conspiracy formed by world leaders from the government to the private sector.
It’s Tom Connolly – that’s who you should be questioning.
I was raised in Nebraska.
What?
I never knew my biological parents, and my memories were blocked.
I don’t care what you believe.
Then maybe you should go out and look for him.
Yes!
They won’t listen to me.
Did you get my blood test back?
You see? They can make anything look like the truth.
In about 20 seconds, that camera’s gonna turn back on. If you’re gonna let me go, you’ve got to do it now, before people see you standing here with me.
How could I possibly be carrying the virus that killed Hawkins?
Coming out of the tunnel, I was chasing Karakurt. He blindsided me.
We need to pull the security tapes at Union Station. If we can find footage of Karakurt, maybe we can prove they infected me.
Who was that?
What are you doing?
Charlene told me. She swore me to secrecy.
This thing you’re going through, ever since Charlene told me, I’ve had a pit in my stomach. I just [ Voice breaking ] I can’t imagine [ Sniffles ]
Okay. [ Sniffles ] 
I’m with the FBI. We’re chasing down a lead on the recent Orea bombing. We have reason to believe the perp fled through Union Station as recently as this morning. We’re gonna need to take a look at your feeds.
You’ve got to be joking. What? A subpoena? We’ve got a terrorist out there – who just killed 14 CIA agents. [ Telephone ringing ] He murdered a sitting US senator. And you want to talk about paperwork?
[ Sighs ] [ Keyboard clacking ] Andropov.
It was Andropov.
He was there. We have to find Andropov and get him to talk.
Questioning for what?
Anton Velov? Agent Keen, FBI. We spoke briefly on the phone a few days ago.
Not entirely, no.
I need you to tell me where I can find Leo Andropov.
You were a CI for one of the Orea agents that died in the bombing. You recorded a conversation for him that took place here in this restaurant, and we know Andropov was a part of that conversation. So I’m gonna ask you again, where can I find him?
A safe house. An address?
That’s not what you told me on the phone. You said you could help me with Katarina Rostova.
And now I want you to tell me about her.
First, you don’t know. Now you can’t say. Which is it? 
You got to him.
In exchange for his silence about my mother.
You got me out of the post office. You gave me a chance to prove my innocence. I know you think you care about me. But every time you do something that makes me think you really do, you do something else that reminds me that you simply aren’t capable of it.
What sin of mine could you possibly have absorbed?
I do, and I’ll handle it on my own, because that’s what I’m capable of.♤
I have a lead, something that could clear all of this up, but I need your help.
I can’t. If I run now, then I’ll be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.
Yes, it is. And he’s right. I can’t leave now.
This lead I have –  Leo Andropov –
He created the virus that killed Hawkins. He infected me. If we can find him, then maybe I can prove I was set up. But I don’t think I can do it on my own. I’ve got an address.
Turn! Up there on the right!
You’re losing him!
Yes! I’m not the one who hit a deer on the turnpike.
Just don’t lose him.
He turned down the alley. Circle back.
That’s everything!
No! Oh, God! Stay with me! Come on! [ Groans, sobs ] My mother – he’s the only one who knew about her.
Today. In the alley.
It’s the weirdest thing. In that moment with the bullets flying and the glass – one thing kept running through my head. [ Sighs ] “The boat, the boat. Why didn’t you just get on his boat?” Tell me what to do.
[ Winces ] I’m fine. Tom, I said I was fine.
I don’t want to regret anything.
Not saying yes.
You. Take me with you.
I’m here. All we have to do is go.
I don’t need to know who I am to know what I want.
You.
The flash drive that we found in Andropov’s safe house – it’s full of records, including documents about Cooper.
Yeah. His medical records, test results, medications, the – the Senator, – the bombing.
Cooper’s doctor works for The Cabal. [ Sighs ] I’ll be back. [ Dialing ]
I got to – Tom
Agent Cooper, it’s Keen. I need to see you. It’s about your doctor.
Oh, he’s got much more than that.
I wouldn’t call your security. Not until you’ve heard what we have to say.
So here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna make this go away, all of it. You’re gonna exonerate me by prosecuting Karakurt, the real killer of 14 agents and Senator Hawkins. You’re going to agree not to press charges against Charlene. You’re going to reinstate Agent Cooper, and you’re going to convey to the Director that he is not to touch Raymond Reddington.
I can’t let him.
Excuse me.
[ On phone ] Ressler?
Harold Cooper – he had nothing to do with this.
Did you hear me? He’s innocent.
I can’t.
I know.
I need your help.
I killed Tom Connolly.
I’m on, uh, 7th and L, Northeast.
I remember.
I remember everything.
The night of the fire. I know what happened, and I understand why you didn’t want me to find out. When I pulled the trigger – When I shot Connolly, I It came back to me. It was like I was there. I could hear them arguing. [ Flashback. Distorted shouting ] He was hurting her. And I know why my father died that night.♤
I shot him. That’s why you blocked my memory – not to protect yourself. To protect me.
You’re my sin eater.♤
What?
hey’ll set a perimeter.
Capitol Police, Park Police, MPDC. We’ll never make it out of the city.
What is this place?
The who?
Ready for what?
You released the contents of the Fulcrum to the press.
Did you expect him to just come forward?
If I didn’t know any better, I’d believe him.
They’re gonna believe I’m a Russian spy. My mother was a Russian spy. It doesn’t matter that I never knew her. It’s the perfect story. I’m the perfect patsy.
Patient? Do you have any idea the kind of resources they’re throwing at us right now, the manpower? This city–
People will go on believing I’m a terrorist.
This isn’t making me feel better.
What happened to him?
 What’s going on?
No.
Porsche Carrera. Two-seater suggests no family. Price tag indicates he’s wealthy enough to live alone, maybe a girlfriend. If he’s here, it’s likely his apartment is empty.
The address will be on the registration in the glove compartment.
You said the plan was to wait, that it was impossible to cross the perimeter.
I don’t know who that is.
[ Shyly ] What do you think?
[ Approaches Red ] She was blonde. My mother. That picture in your apartment–  she was blonde. I look like her, don’t I?
Is she alive?
This is him? This is the Troll Farmer?
Who are you?
When I was a little girl, I used to imagine that my mother was a prima ballerina who danced fr kings and queens in London and Paris. And she only left me with Sam until she could come home again and sweep me away. I never would’ve imagined. What happened to her? My mother.
Everyone talks as if she was a terrible person. Was she?
Vans? We’re splitting up?
Why?
Yeah.
Where are you?
Turn back where? There’s nowhere – What are you doing?
Where are you going?
What? What am I gonna do?
I can’t.
What are you saying?
I can’t do this.
[ To driver ]’2650 Wisconsin Avenue.
It’s the only chance I’ve got. [ To driver ] 2650 Wisconsin Avenue. Get there now.
[ To guards ] Help! My name is Masha Rostova. I’m a Russian agent. I work for the FSB, and I’m seeking diplomatic immunity.
Are you the Embassy Intelligence Chief?
I am not here to speak to a pawn without adequate clearance.
My name is Masha Rostova. I am a deep cover operative for the Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti. I have successfully completed my mission and am hereby seeking asylum. I would appreciate an immediate and private audience with your Chief Intelligence Officer.
Who are you?
I came here to protect myself, to get your help because our interests are aligned. Your country and I have been blamed for crimes we did not commit. It was committed by a global consortium known in some quarters as the Cabal.
To reignite the Cold War between Russia and the United States.
I will tell you everything that I know after I’ve been guaranteed, in writing, diplomatic immunity.
The Russian assassin, the one known as Karakurt.
He’s been turned. The Cabal framed me. Who better than the daughter of a KGB agent? Raskovich: Hmm. Katarina Rostova.
Don’t you see that’s playing right into the Cabal’s narrative? The minute I leave US soil, my government will interpret that as a defection.
[ Reading ]: “1-4-2-5 Peabody.” 
[ Exhales deeply ]
No, I’m not all right. [ Inhales deeply ] [ Whispers ] Ressler tried to kill me.
I was out of options. At least I would’ve been secure in Moscow right now.
I’ll just have coffee, thanks. You know him? We’re safe here?
[ To herself ] Come on, pull it together.
An MPDC cruiser just pulled up out back.
What are you –
Now what? [ Lowered voice ]
It’s already gone bad, and you’re making it worse. If you wanna repay me, do what Reddington says before somebody else gets hurt.
This is not working.
Cut it out. A lawyer? How is that gonna help us with this?
That’s the only way to stop the swelling.
I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.
What is he working on? A plea agreement? Why else bring a lawyer in here other than to cut a deal? If you think for one second that I am interested–
Then why go to all the trouble to bring him in here? Doesn’t make any sense.
And what happened to his son?
[ Lowered voice ] His lungs are gonna collapse if we don’t get him medical attention in the next 20 to 30 minutes tops.
Leaving?
This whole thing, the diner, it wasn’t a hostage situation. It was a jail break.♤
You really think he can help?
Where do we go from here? 
His wife, the way she looked at me. No one’s ever looked at me like that before. How do you do it?
How do you deal with people looking at you that way? The fear? How do you go on knowing that people are terrified of you?
Why didn’t you do it? You went into Naval Intelligence instead.
The Cabal – they blamed you for something you hadn’t done.
I think you would’ve made a terrific captain.
We were out. You said the ship we were on was headed to Spain.
Because?
Take a look around. We are hardly in prime position to be fighting anyone right now.
How is that ever gonna happen?
Nothing.
I’ve read about this. Modifying the DNA of the seed itself, teaching it to create a protein that kills common pests that would eat it.
Damaging one building will hardly kill Verdiant.
Assuming we could do that, why would we?
What is it?
This’ll do. [ She breaks into a car ]
We got wheels.
I wouldn’t.
The next one goes in your leg.
You think Matchett is responsible?
Costa isn’t here.
[ Sighs ] [ Computer chimes, mouse clicking ] I don’t know what happened. I used to consider myself lucky. I had a husband I loved, a job I always wanted. I was the kind of person good things happen to.
That’s kind of sweet, actually.
Did he take it?
What ever happened to Mugs? Did he land on his feet?
There’s something going on with that vent.
I don’t understand. How did they find us?
Forget about the box. We need to leave. They’re one step behind us.
It’s not Aram.
Why are you doing this?
You know me. You know I’ve been framed.
I’m just trying to get my life back. Verdiant is connected to the Cabal. Reddington thinks that if we get enough leverage–
If you’re interested in the truth, back off. Let me do what I have to do to clear my name.
Looks like Costa was copying Verdiant documents and feeding them to Matchett and his crew. He kept this ledger to keep track of the documents he stole.
He was sending them to a feed store in Wilson Park? Wait, wait, look. We can’t just go charging in there. We had a hard enough time handling the Cabal when the FBI was backing us, let alone hunting us down.
I’m not anxious. I’m scared.♤
Rover keypad. Four-digit PIN. Could be thousands of combinations.
What is this place? [ Door opens ] This is it. This is the genome data they stole from Verdiant.
[ Computer beeping ] Is that Ressler and Samar?
I don’t know. These files are massive. We should go. I saw a storm door on the side of the building.
We’re not gonna make it. Reddington! [ Computer beeping ]
Clear.
We’ve got around 90%, but I’m not sure it’s readable. We’ll probably need help accessing the data without a complete download.
I called him while you were in the store.
I told him to back off because I thought if he was interested in the truth, maybe–
That’s not true. He’s a person. He’s a good person.
We should go. I’ll check the parking lot, find us a new ride. Meet me out front in a minute.
Drop your gun!
We can’t.
He’ll be dead by the time the ambulance gets here. I’m not leaving him.
Help! We need help here! Single shot to the chest! He’s breathing, but barely any pulse.
Do you think he has a family?
He’s gonna die.
You saw that hospital. They wouldn’t have a thoracic surgeon on call. They’d have to medevac him to a different county.
A virologist who specializes in GMOs. So, where did Eli Matchett find one? The documents we got from Cost ld – the ones he stole from Verdiant. Liz: They were talking about a special development project –
And Eduardo this morning at the Segadores farm. He said Verdiant was working on some top-secret R&D at a warehouse in Silver Ridge. What are you thinking?
I shot a cop.
And killed the Attorney General of the United States.
Am I a good person? I’m not so sure anymore.
Karakurt. We know you’re working for the Cabal. How was the virus delivered?
Yes, thank God. I got a shower for the first time in days.
Not many people are these days.♤
We have a web address. There are encryptions we can’t decipher. I know this is asking a lot, but we wouldn’t come to you if Reddington didn’t believe that this Djinn might be helpful in clearing my name.
I have to believe Ressler wants the truth about who attacked our country just as much as we do. If that’s true, he’ll accept help anywhere he can get it.
What? Tom? I-I don’t understand.
You’re a terrible actor.♤
So, why did you produce his play?
This woman – The Djinn – you said she can help, but you haven’t said how.
I promise.
Wait. W-where are we going?
“If”?
I want revenge.
I was framed. I want the people who did this to admit it and pay for what they’ve done.
It’s what I want.
What does?
[ Clatter ] I’m sorry. [ She pretends to stumble, puts tracking device on Alice’s shoe ]
Hi. Uh, I’m sorry.
Y-yeah.
She had guards, so I couldn’t ask her about the Cabal. I gave her the story, but she didn’t believe I was being honest. She wanted to know my real fantasy.♤
Well, I didn’t say anything. I put the bug on her shoe.
It’s been the same thing for as long as I can remember. I’m walking in a park with my husband. In between us is our little girl. I’m holding her hand in mine and I never let go.♤
The Range Rover in the driveway, those diamond earrings, your shoes– your aspirations clearly exceed your reality.
Alice was right. No guards.
What? What is it? You’ve been quiet ever since we left Alice. Is it Dembe?
What about it?
He won’t be alive. Look at him. He needs medical attention.
We’re running out of time. Get what you came for, and let’s go.
I should have never agreed to this. Risking everything, for what? Another list of names. How valuable can they be?
[ Points gun at Nasim ] Your deal was with him.♤
Tom.
I can’t believe you came back.
You had a plan. The boat–
I know you went to Ressler and offered to help.
Listen, Tom, you don’t have to do this.
You said you wanted out of this life– out of the secrets and the lies and the risk. I don’t want to be the one to drag you back into this.
Tom. Listen–
In where? Where are you? What have you done?
[ Door opens ] Did you know a Presidential Commission was looking into the attacks?
If they do their job, if they look for the truth, this could all end.
The Cabal– they found us.
What could be worse than that?
Wendigo? Who’s that?
This Wendigo, if he doesn’t work for the Cabal, who does he work for?
This vigilante believes I deserve to die?
Call me? Where are you going?
Did Ressler agree to help?
Oh! Gun!
No! Get down!
[ Runs, then finds a car, crouches near drivers seat ] [ Gunshot💥 ] [ Engine turns over ] [ 💥Gunshots💥  ] [ Tires screech ] [ Liz speeds away, using only detached rear view mirror to look ahead ]
I’ve been thinking about the shooter.-
He had a clear line of sight and a secure location. On the other side of McDougal, there is a hotel, The Palace or Park something – It had to be from there. Contact hotel security. They’ll have footage. You might get an image. If you’re lucky, a print.
Samar?
What did you find?
Samar, what did you find?
I would. I do. But not for the things I haven’t.
The bullet was so close, I could hear it. I thought–
You spoke to him?
You shot an elephant?
Take the stairs!
Oh, my God. This emblem – I’ve seen it before.
You were on the website.
That’s why you gave us Wendigo – to knock out the competition.
Let go! Stop!
Yeah.
He got away.
We’re going with him.
I’m going with Dembe.
Uh, the website says “Kill confirmed.”
Hang on. Here we go. I got an e-mail.
What are you doing?
I can’t get a physical address from the routing number without Aram’s help.
Arioch Cain?
Take me off the site.
You need to take me off that site.
This isn’t a game! People are trying to kill me!
Your mother died in the Orea bombing.
I am so sorry, but I had nothing to do –
Take it down, Blair, before more innocent people die.
I still think about her every day – what we might talk about, what her voice might sound like. I promise you, I had nothing to do with your mother’s death. I will do whatever it takes to find the people responsible. But I can’t do anything until you take me off that site.
Thank you. Blair, I’m gonna get the people that killed your mother.
[ Sighs ] Okay. Drink. It’s Japanese matcha tea. It has 17 times the antioxidants of wild blueberries and seven more thank dark chocolate.
I thought I was taking care of you.
Stubborn. Sweet. Stubborn.
The French economist?
What does that mean to us?
Another? How many are there?
The Director is working with the task force.
[ Who has been in background all along, absorbing ] Clever. But none of it’s going to matter unless we get Andras Halmi. 
Crispin Crandall. I thought he was dead.
You gave them this case.
[ Reads ] Andras Halmi – dewar UT-0027.
Someone’s here. 
You knew this would happen?
Hasaan? That’s the rumor you heard? He’s responsible for the abduction of the Lazarum employees?
How do you propose we do that?
My old home.
We know who you are, Farzin.
His men are dead. He needs a way out. He must have contacted you again.
Where have you– are you okay?
What’s going on?
[ To Red ] It’s Tom. He wants to meet.
I don’t see that happening anytime soon.
Karakurt’s willing to confess?
You told me that I should have stayed on the boat and never come back.
You had a dream. I wanted you to follow it. I still do.
Other matter?
Oh.
Oh, it’s been a long drive. Any chance I can hear about Ian and the beekeeper after I clean up? [ Laughing ]
He was just here. He got gas at pump 5.
No, he would have paid cash.
Okay, listen to me, this is very important. My friend – he wouldn’t have just left.
Thank you. No. I’m sure he’s here somewhere.Thanks for your concern, Officer.
Please tell me Reddington’s called you.
He was here one minute. He was getting gas. And now he’s gone. I-I’ve called and called.
You can’t leave the store.
I’m sure there’s an explanation, but you cannot leave until you’ve secured the care package.
Reddington’s missing.
Samar, I need you to promise me something. If I give you his burner number– if ask you to trace his location, can you promise me you won’t tell Ressler?
240-555-0146. Samar, I know what a difficult position I’m putting you in.
But Reddington just vanished.
A salvage yard.
Thank you. Thanks for the ride.
How’d it get here?
Can you tell me where to find him?
Ohh!
I’m sorry. Let me get you another one. [ To bartender: ] Uh, two.
Ohh. What’s her name? The one who broke it?
Amber’s a bitch.
I’m Kenya.
Well, I am quite a girl.
Oh! [ Laughs ]
I’m gonna go tinkle.
You couldn’t stay away.
I got a better idea. Your place.
Wow, I love what you’ve done with the place.♤
You gonna offer me a beer? [ Both chuckle ] Wait right here.
Where’s my friend?! 
You’re holding my friend. I want to make a deal.
Straight trade– him for Reddington.
I don’t think you understand the situation here.
Listen to me.
I can. Uh, it’ll take some time. I’ll call you back in two hours.
Reddington’s been abducted. I’m not exactly sure by who, and I don’t know why, but I think I have a plan to get him back.
I’m not asking his permission.
If we don’t do this, they’re gonna kill him.
Let’s just hope it’s not his blood.
Where is he?
Do you think we’re stupid?
Yeah. And they’re worth far more than the reward the FBI is offering.
Aah!
ohh. You wouldn’t.
Reddington’s missing. Samar, I need you to trace his location.
Karakurt’s willing to confess?
We have to give him the care package.
[ After chase, panting ]
Just so you know, I’m not ashamed of what I did.
He was a terrorist.
Well, I’m glad you have your convictions. I just don’t wanna die for them.♤
You and I both know I’m never making it to that hearing alive.
Whatever happens, I don’t blame you.
Not having much luck?
He’ll come for you.
Find out what?
I’ve been better.
I’m having trouble breathing.
[ Gasping ]
Aram, I can’t –  I can’t breathe. [ Exhales sharply ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
It doesn’t make any sense. Even if they shut out the air, I should be able to breathe in here for hours, right?
[ Wheezes and coughs ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Coughs ]
[ Wheezing ]
[ Grunting ] [ Gasps ]
Aram, put the gun down! They’ll shoot you without thinking twice.
I do. You’ve done enough.
Aram. Aram, look at me. Look at me. I don’t blame you for letting me out. I don’t. Now please put the gun down.
 Whispers ] It’s about time.
They were gonna kill me. The Director wasn’t taking me to any black site for questioning about actionable Intel. If you hadn’t shown up when you did, I’d be dead.
What happened?
My God. They’re in the White House.
As much as she trusted Laurel Hitchin?
I need a pen and paper.
I don’t have a will.
Uh– [ Crowd shouting indistinctly ]
No.
The criminal defense attorney?
I’m here.
Thank you.
You look tired.
When’s the lawyer coming?
Thank you.
What does that mean?
Is this how you start all your client consultations?
16?
I’m innocent. I’m being framed.
They’re gonna kill me. Today.
That’s the judge Reven Wright selected? The personal friend she said we could trust?
He did it? They got the Director?
How’s the Russian?
[ Lowered voice ] Thank you.
It was her hit. Why would she call it off?
This is official? They’re willing to say I’m innocent?
But I’d be pleading guilty to a homicide. They’re taking away my badge. If I sign this, I’ll never be an agent again.
Yes.
But I won’t be an agent. I’ll be an asset like you.
This is fair.
 Sighs ] Got a pen? [ Exhales ] 
[ chuckles ] I won’t be needing this. [ rips it up ] 
But I won’t be an agent. I’ll be an asset like you.
Don’t. I mean, if anything, feel relieved. A week ago, I was facing 16 counts of capital murder. Besides, I still got my personal piece and a CCP.
Will I at least be issued a weapon for field operations?
I’m good. It’s okay. I appreciate the pep talk, but I’m good. I really am.
I told myself I wasn’t gonna cry so I’m gonna make this quick. [ Sighs, tears up ] [ Voice breaking ] Apparently not quick enough.
You see, that’s– I’m not an agent anymore. I put you all in an impossible situation, and for reasons I’ll never quite understand, you gave me the benefit of every doubt, even Mr. I’m-Just-Doing-My-Job. You did so much more than that.
Never heard of it.
I’m sorry, wait. Are you giving me a case?
I thought maybe after all we’ve been through the past three months that you might want to take a break. I mean, aren’t you exhausted?
And where is this Shell Island?
I’d have thought you would’ve been invited.
And who is that?
Dmitri Sarkovski, the CEO of Vitus One bank, helped orchestrate and now profits from the Greek financial collapse. Espen Van Der Merwe –
All of them are at large for charges, including narcotics trafficking, smuggling, cyber crimes, and assassination.
The Shell Island retreat provides a rare opportunity to capture the heads of some of the most lethal organized crime syndicates.
He knows someone who does – Howard Jasnoch.  He’s an underworld travel agent of sorts.
Oh. Sorry. Instinct.
We need to go to your boat.
Now.
[ Laughs ] I don’t know what to say.
[ Breathes heavily ] Tom If I’ve learned one thing from being on the run these past few months, it’s that I can’t tell you what I’m gonna want 10 years from now. Even a year from now.
He doesn’t even look like him.
So you’re Raymond Reddington?
Why don’t you tell me about the case files?
You were in possession of classified data. How did you get it?
The case files– how are they connected to Shell Island?
They were criminals who were taken down by the Bureau.
He’s bluffing.
Oh, sorry. No, it’s cool. I got somewhere I gotta be, so [ Sighs ] 
I love it. Here’s my application. How soon can I move in?
Yes. Is there a problem?
But I thought you said –
I see. Okay. Thank you.
Then why bother? Why give a guy like that the time of day?
Not if you move on. We beat Berlin and the Cabal. Isn’t that enough for you? It is for me.
I- I know I’m lucky the way things turned out, but I can’t even rent an apartment because people think I’m a criminal. Tom thinks we should just go away and start over. Maybe he’s right.
It’s your battle, not mine.
Me?
But who would care that I’m Katarina Rostova’s daughter?
Disappeared? You and Sam told me she’s dead.
But I don’t know anything.
Janet Macnamara’s been taken. To get her back, we have to find Caligiuri. I want the location of the Shell Island retreat.
What do you want?
Not gonna happen.
We cut a deal– immunity in exchange for taking us to the meeting. We’re marshalling strike teams now.
I know you said you don’t know where this meeting is, and I want to believe you, but if this is another one of your games, if you have some sort of hidden agenda, and you plan on going, don’t. If we show up and you’re there, it’ll only confirm their suspicions.
Status?
Has the target cleared the lobby?
[ Taps key ] Why am I not hearing anything?  Aram, is he in or not? 
Wait, is it me or– That sounds like Reddington.
Reddington knows our protocol. If he’s in there, it’s because he knew we’d find him. He knows we’re listening. If he’s willing to roll the dice, we should be, too.
Is it possible they know each other?
You got that?
Go! Breach! Now! 
What was his name?
Were you close?
But you killed him.
You manufactured a doppelganger to reclaim your reputation.
Why not tell us?
So they could spread the word that we’re not working together.
No. The woman who turned me down for the apartment.
No!
[ Inhales sharply ] Well, all things considered [ Sighs ] Like crap.
I’ve broken a few before.
It is? The baby.
[ Exhales sharply ] 
Hey.
[ Chuckles ] Okay, great.
Well, my ribs feel better, so I’m fine.
I prefer the bookish teacher.
Boston? You’re gonna move to –
Our– our kid?
I– I hate to break up this family reunion, but I got to go.
Okay. A teacher?
I see you’ve started without me.
I appreciate that, and the cards and flowers and trashy novels– especially the trashy novels, Aram. Thank you. But I am good. Don’t let me interrupt. What’s the case?
What sins did these two commit?
What is that? Some kind of metal?
I’ll have Aram order an analysis, see if we can trace that lead to a supplier.
I’m pregnant.
How?
[ Chuckles ] Yes. With everything that was happening, I just – I mean I guess I knew, but I just couldn’t –  I bought a pregnancy test three weeks ago, and I threw it out before I took it.
I haven’t told him. Uh. He’s still figuring his life out. There’s a job in Boston.
We’ve linked the Vehm’s MO to a dozen murders. Each victim was subjected to some form of medieval torture. Sam Archer was whipped until an artery burst and he bled to death.The bruising, fractures, and deep puncture wounds indicate that Joseph Gibson’s extremities were crushed with some device called “The Spanish Boot.”
We are not sure. We’re still going over case files.
Oh, we meet again.
Who’s this?
Hi, Stanley! [ Both laugh ] Hi, Stanley. He’s so cute!
Well, we can stay up together. I’m expecting a little devil of my own.
That’s very nice of you. I’ll probably take you up on that. Thanks.
I thought you were going to Boston.
What’s that?
You found my pro/con list.
[ Laughs ] Really?
Yeah. We are. But before you get too excited –
Maybe you should take another look at the list. I mean, there are only three pros and, maybe, I can probably think of a hundred cons. I’m a felon. People hate me. I’m a pariah.
Uh, unmarried was never a part of my list.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah. Yeah, they’re – they’re all fixable, Tom, except for one – Reddington.
His life, my life, is so filled with violence and anger and hatred and death. [ Voice breaking ] How can I bring a child into that world? My world.
This is why I didn’t want to tell you. I knew you’d be so annoyingly positive.
I don’t want to be naive!
 Laughs ]
I’m pretty sure I put question marks next to your name.
Yeah.
[ Laughs ] Oh, my God.
The Vehm are hunting pedophiles. William Dowd’s daughter confirmed that’s what her father was.
I’m pregnant, not sick. Besides, you’re the one who said there’s a fight coming that can’t be avoided.
They were never charged with any crimes, but hidden in their backgrounds are whispered accusations – incidents that were swept under the rug.
It fits the fact pattern.
What did it involve? Maybe that’s where we should look.
What? Of course what?
Ressler’s running his prints. Should have an ID soon.
The files you found at St. James contain detailed accounts of the victims. The research they did was extensive. They found details local cops clearly missed.
What do you mean, did nothing? Was the case thrown out?
An eyewitness to the abuse of a child with special needs, and no charges were filed? That makes no sense.
How do they have case files? They’re not cops. Where did they get them? Who did they get them from? Who took the eyewitness statement?
We need to call him, see if it ever happened. I doubt it did.
The Vehm are zealots. They’ll kill anyone they’re told is a pedophile. What if someone’s telling them people are pedophiles that aren’t? Reddington says his friend wasn’t. What if the person bringing these case reports is someone with their own agenda and they’re using the Vehm to carry it out?
That file. Your file– it says the eyewitness in the Shepherd case gave his statement to a Baltimore ADA by the name of Peter Levy. We called the Baltimore District Attorney. There is no Peter Levy. Once we found out that case was false, we looked at the others. Jared Locke’s victim? Well, he doesn’t exist. You were given a screen grab of a model from a children’s clothing website. You killed William Bosker for molesting his nephew in Akron, Ohio, on June 23rd? Well, the State Department said that he was living in London at the time. You’re being manipulated. We need you to tell us by who.
I’m gonna ask you one last time. Who gave you these files? 
Well, I am a consultant. I came to consult with Cardinal Richards.
Where is the cardinal?
Where did they take him?
They’re gonna kill him.
The cardinal took out the others in order to expand his business. Did you take him out to expand yours?
Anything on Cardinal Richards?
So, how’d it go?
I don’t understand. I thought you already had it.
Reddington.
Which he’ll find out about and then sabotage, especially if it means me going away. I know you think I’m overreacting, – but I just want to know that my –
I want to know my kid is protected.
Sure.
I don’t know. I’m kind of into empty. I get to take my time. Fill it with what I want. Make it my own. A new start.
Yeah.
Oh – ! [ Both chuckle ] 
What are you doing here?
Yeah, I, uh, dyed my hair to hide. I don’t need to hide anymore.
You got me a couch.
Tom.
Taking his job away.
You’re the only reason I need protection.
I think you should leave.
Zoe, it’s your neighbor, Liz. Could use some company.
Where’s Zoe?
 Why?
Hello, my name is Elizabeth Keen. I’m calling about my pregnancy. My child. If- if you could please call me at 202-555-0143. It’s about an adoption. Giving up my child.
Boston? You’re gonna move to–
I’m pregnant.
I’m thinking about giving he baby up for adoption.
My life is so filled with death, how can I bring a child into that world?
Reddington.
You’re the only reason I need protection.
If-if you could please call me, it’s about giving up my child.
When Tom and I were looking to start a family, you gave us all the information about the birth mother. Would you be giving prospective parents information about me?
I mean, I would need to see the child.
And if we both swipe right, we’re hooked up for life?
Yeah, of course. This is a decision that we have to make together, and I mean, he would be here if he didn’t have to be away for work right now.
You know, I usually like people think to enter my apartment after I’m in it.
No, is he here, too?
My mother– was she still alive when I was placed with Sam?
How did my mother die?
Mads Eriksson runs a criminal conglomerate with his three sons. Or at least he did. Hans Eriksson, AKA Happy, who later died, was shot in a New York restaurant by Rafael Vacarro, son of Daniel Vacarro.
Each family blamed the other. And Gregor Eriksson was shot, and Vacarro’s nephew was killed.
I’m not registered.
Yeah, ’cause I’m not.
Say cheese.
Good luck getting an ID. The DEA had nothing. Facial recognition was a bust. CSU swept for prints, but it’s an active business. They pulled hundreds of latents. Running those will take time we don’t have.
You mean do I remember you being in possession of a stolen masterpiece? Yeah, I recall that.
[ On phone ] They said they’re interested? .
Oh, that’s perfect. Uh- Well, uh, as soon as you have a time, just give me a call back.
Levi? How is your impossibly gorgeous ex?
Uh The burp rags can wait. Uh, what happened at the hospital? [ Sighs ]
You really think it’s possible that he had Christopher’s fiancé killed so Christopher would be available to marry a Vacarro?
Don’t call me that.
You don’t know anything.
I told you not to call me that.
He’s trying to draw he promnestria out.
[ To Red ] This was so you could get to him. That’s what this whole thing was about.
I told you not to call me that.
Samar, I just spoke to the DA, and he says he has enough evidence to put both families out of business.
Nothing.
Samar, what’s wrong?
There’s not going to be a shower.
Well I found this wonderful coupl …
They’re not coming.
They’re rejecting my baby?
Oh, I see.
They’re rejecting me.
But I thought you said on the phone– 
Meaning I would never know my child? My baby would never know who I am? [ Voice breaking ] I can’t do that.
Hey. What’s this?
I-I can’t take this. I’m sorry.
She cared for them so sweetly, they never grew old.
Lady Ambrosia. Ugh. Always creeped me out. I’m more of a Wizard of Oz fan. You just can’t beat a farm girl in great shoes. [ Laughs ]
Missing children turn up.
I love Annapolis. I had a friend who went to the naval academy, and we used to go to this little Italian restaurant, Marias, on the water. Is it even still open?
Beside the point. Anyway, um, it seems like a lovely place to raise a child.
Can I be honest? I like you guys a lot, and you’re probably too polite to ask about it, but you do know about my past?
But I have gotten my hopes up before, so I just want to make sure you’re completely comfortable with me being a part of my child– our child’s life. 
Three children, all missing and presumed dead. Mary Jones died on a family camping trip in 2003. Jeffrey Childs disappeared from his backyard two years later. In 2012, Ethan Linley drowned on the Ohio River. All three were later found alive. All three had traces of these ritualistic patterns painted on their bodies.
No. Jones was also autistic, and Childs was blind.
I understand he’s autistic. Is there any sign of abuse?
Hi, Ethan. I’m Liz. I’m here to help. Okay, how are you feeling? How do you feel?
[ Sighs ] I can’t imagine what it must have been like for them all these years, thinking their child was dead.
What is it? What’s wrong?
Ethan Linley disappeared on May 20, 2012. In the six months before he “passed away,” his parents met with four different adoption agencies. Ethan apparently requires around-the-clock care– medical therapy, speech and language therapy. In fact, Jeanne quit her job to be Ethan’s full-time caregiver.
They said yes?
It’s great, and I can’t thank you enough. Wow. This is really gonna happen.
Tom, where are you? Listen, it’s all good! I figured out another way to make some cash. [ Laughter, cheering ]
What’s going on?
From what?
Tom, what have you done?
Come on. [ Sighs ] You hungry? How do you feel about waffles? Uh… Ugh. No toaster. No microwave. No problem. No problem. I know, the whole idea that Mozart will improve cognitive skills is a myth, but they say babies start learning in the womb, so, on the off chance it’ll get him into Harvard…
 Oh!
It’s okay, Ethan! It’s okay! It’s just a smoke alarm. It’s fine. [ Grunts ] Ethan?
What are you doing?! Put that away! What are you doing?! Get out! Get out!
I want him gone.
I don’t want his protection any more than I want your money.
I’m giving my child up for adoption.
How can you, of all people, ask me that question? The life I have because of you is no place for a child. I can’t even make a waffle without one of your people bursting into my home with a gun.
You and Tom agree on something.
[ Sighing ] Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. That’s it. 
The key to these abductions is parental consent. No child can be adopted out without both parents agreeing. So I had Aram look over Noah Shuster’s case files.
According to Ethan’s father, adoption was his mother’s idea. He was working extra shifts to pay for Ethan’s private school and therapies, leaving her alone with him. He was trying to appease his wife by meeting with Shuster, but he maintains that he never wanted to go through with it.
I think this Lady Ambrosia is using Shuster to identify mothers and fathers who want to get rid of their kids but can’t because their spouses won’t consent.
Hello?
Ethan, I just realized I don’t have an extra toothbrush. We’re gonna have to go back to the store, okay? Let’s go.
Okay.
Ethan, run! Go now!
Ethan? Ethan? [ Breathing heavily ]
Oh, thank God. Ethan, you can come out now. Everything’s okay. You’re safe now. You’re safe. 
I feel like I’ve made a connection with him on some level and that he might tell me where he was being kept, where the other children are being held. You need to say goodbye. [ Pen clicking ] [ Sighs ] Hey, Ethan. You’re gonna go with Miss Sickler now, and she’s gonna take you to a place that is so safe. And you’re gonna be surrounded by people who care about you. And no one is ever gonna hurt you again. Okay? [ Clicking continues ] 
You took Noah Shuster?
What is your interest in this case?
I found a couple… to take the baby. Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it… How did she do it– my mother?
The night of the fire– that’s what they were arguing about?
And I shot him.
Tell me. I need to know.
So, that night, I killed both my parents.
[ Sniffles ]
Hey, Ethan. Can I come in? So you decided to stick around, huh? Ethan, what is this?
Isn’t it amazing? Look at the patterns on the wings. They remind me of…
Same dark edges, same spotting.
Why would Ethan want me to know that?
[ To Ethan ] Follow me.
Hey, Tom. I’m just wondering where you are. Give me a call when you can.
[ Liz is reading aloud under the table inside Ethan’s “fort” ] “‘How can I get there?’ Asked Dorothy. ‘You must walk. It is a long journey through a country that is sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magic arts I know to keep you from harm.’ She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. ‘When you get to Oz… do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Goodbye, my dear.'” 
There’s not going to be a shower.
I’m giving my child up for adoption.
You and Tom agree on something.
Yeah.
Where is he? Do you know? He’s not answering his cell.
Did you hurt him?
‘Cause the last time I spoke to him, he told me we’d be free. Of you.
Why are we at an art exhibit?
Most performance artists don’t kill people in service of their work.
CAFO?
A little heavy-handed.
This man has fans? People support him?
And how do you know Drexel killed Randy Brenner?
According to Reddington, this photo started circulating two hours before Randy Brenner’s body was discovered.
It was published online in an underground zine called Rigby. Apparently they post about all things underground. Someone using the handle “Rimona” wrote an article promoting Drexel’s next show.
Reddington’s looking for Rimona. Apparently she’s gonna have an exclusive interview with Drexel in next week’s edition.
[ Sighs ]
Tom didn’t show up for dinner last night, and he’s not picking up his cell.
That’s what Reddington says.
Did you tell Cooper about the adoption?
Samar, why would you…
No, I just hadn’t decided how I was gonna tell the others.
Tom, is that you?
Nik? It’s– Wow. Hey.
Shot?! Is he okay? Where is he?
Please tell me he’s okay.
Oh, my God.
Will he?
It’s complicated.
Robbery? That’s all you heard?
Nope. No idea. All I know is that he had the delusion that we could be a family… That we could get away from…
You have no idea what it’s like… To feel like you’re trapped… To feel like your life isn’t your own anymore. 
He’s in the hospital!  He was shot!
He was involved in some kind of robbery, and now the police want to question him!
No. I am not your Lizzy… to control, to be told what to do. Don’t you get it? The only reason Tom did what he did is because he had to do something desperate to get away from this.
Damn right, I blame you. If he dies…
[ Breathes deeply ] [ Chuckles ] Hey. Tom, you’re okay. You’re in the ICU. Uh– Don’t try to talk. You need to save your strength so I can kill you.♤
He’s barely conscious. You don’t need to do this right now.
Is he under arrest? Tom, don’t say anything! He’s invoking his right to counsel. 
No, it isn’t.
You think it was Reddington?
When I confronted him, I didn’t know what you were being accused of. I just said you were part of some sort of robbery. He already knew. He told me about the diamonds.
I don’t understand. You told him? Since when do you talk to Reddington?
Nik, I had no idea.
Why did you do it? You don’t want me to be with Tom, but you saved him.
Thank you.
I know. Wait. 
I want to keep the baby. 
Our baby. 
I want to keep the baby. Our baby. 
I’m the one who’s supposed to be taking care of you.
Hm. Mm. Wow. You’re feeling better.
That’s good.
Yes.
Yes, I want to marry you. [ Laughs ]
Yes. I want to take care of you for the rest of our lives, for better and definitely for worse.
Not if you’re at the other end of it.
Oh, I can get it.
Rest.
We’ve decided to keep the baby.
I’ve accepted Tom’s proposal. We’re gonna get married.
I know how you feel about him. I hope you’ll keep an open mind. [ Chuckles ]
Yes. Fished out of the Hai river.
How?
He wanted insurance that the government wouldn’t kill him.
So, in Addison Wen’s case, that recording was leverage. He probably didn’t want in released unless he was murdered or arrested for the poisoning of Zhang Lau.
According to Reddington, the recording of Pritchard and Addison Wen is just one secret of thousands. He says The Caretaker has evidence of murder, corruption, blackmail, and not just from governments– from corporations, billionaires. This is the kind of information people kill to acquire.
He wants us to find The Caretaker and contain the leaks.
Tom and I are getting married.
I’m so sorry about what’s happening with you and Charlene.
[ Laughs ] It’s crazy. [ Sighs ] I just wish… Despite everything she’s put me through, I wish my mom could be there.
I mean, everybody has something to say about her. I just wish I knew the truth for myself, you know?
I tracked down this one man– Anton Velov. He said he didn’t know much, but I think he was holding something back.
Who?
What?
I haven’t forgotten. Forgiveness can’t change the past, but I believe it can change the future.
He’s here?
So it’s true. It really exists.
They employ me as a consultant. He employs me as an inside source.
Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Velov. About a year ago, I came to visit you in your restaurant.
That’s right. I was hoping you could answer a few more questions for me.
Please. She was my mother.
I’m sorry, um… Why did you agree to meet with me if you can’t help me?
What is it? What do you see?
So it’s military. It’s an after-market job– very specialized. Only a few custom shops have the equipment necessary to install it. I can’t say which one, but I know someone who can. 
The gunmen who took Rose Janus– I’ve got an address.
Reddington spotted some custom work on their van, traced it to a chop shop. We got a physical address on the customer. I want that address. Then I want you back here with Reddington.
Why? What happened?
And the White House is asking for Reddington’s help?
You know everything there is to know about port security.
Irina Velov?
This is for you. It’s from your father. He told me you’re estranged. And my name is Elizabeth, by the way. He couldn’t find you, so… Anyway, he says it explains everything.
Me? I don’t understand.
My mother’s alive. You lied to me.
Velov was the agent assigned to find her. He was getting close, she knew it. That’s why she allegedly walked into the ocean. She wanted the world to believe she drowned.
He tracked her to a hotel in Prague. She had just left. But in such a hurry, she missed this… A photo of her little girl. Me.
You said the name Masha Rostova had been lost to history until the manhunt. Now it’s out there, and someone’s looking for me. It’s my mother. Who else would care? Who? [ Sighs ] You were right. Some things can’t be forgiven. 
Hey. 
How was your day?
Yes, I want to marry you.
You said the name Masha Rostova had been lost to history until the manhunt. Now it’s out there, and someone’s looking for me? It’s my mother!
And the dress and the flowers and all that stuff. We don’t need it. They had a cancelation at the church this afternoon. I say we go for it.
Doesn’t this feel right? To do it now, today, at St. Cecilia’s, where we wanted to do it the first time?
April 25th. I’m due on the 22nd.
But it will be a lot better than waiting a week or two and having you roll me down the aisle.
 Come on. It’s me and you. We usually do like six impossible things before breakfast.
I know. That’s why I do it.
Wait until the wedding night. 
How does that happen?
And the unofficial story? The Cabal?
Is that what this is really about? Getting me to delay my wedding?
I’ll take it to the task force.
But I’m not going to get involved. What I am going to do is get married. And I hope you can be there. [ To Dembe: ] Both of you.
That’s convenient.
Um, about the wedding – Uh, it’s this afternoon.
Which is what I came to talk to you about.
Yes. Which I’m not taking, but I think that you should, even if it means you can’t make it. Aram: Hang on. No, no, no, no. I’m not even done with the playlist. I don’t have your wedding gift. I was gonna lose a few pounds to fit in my new slim-fit suit, which is houndstooth, by the way…
Look, it’s very small. Just a few friends. I would love it if you could be there, but preventing Solomon from getting this weapon is much more important than coming to watch me remarry my ex-husband.
[ To Cooper ] Look, I meant what I said about you taking this case, but if you happen to be done in time, I would love it if you could perform the ceremony.
You can get ordained online. It takes like 10 minutes. Uh, look, there’s a minister, but we don’t know him, and I’d just much rather you say a few words.
Great. The service is at 4:00. No pressure.
How we doing?
I picked up your suit from the cleaners, and I dropped it at the apartment.
Today is not about him. It’s about you marrying a woman who is eight months pregnant.
I told you peonies. And don’t forget the candles.
Yeah.
We good?
This is about you and Tom. Look, I know the two of you have –
I get where you’re coming from, and I love you for saying it. But I kept him prisoner in the hull of a ship and tortured him for two months, so in my book we’re even.
Yes? [ Red appears in her mirror ] What brings you here? You need an update on the Solomon case?
Then you’re here for the wedding?
You’re wrong. You don’t know him.
No. He’s changed.
No. I am attempting to build a life with the father of my child. [ Tom is shown burying The Major ] A normal life with two parents who love one another. With everything you know about me, can’t you see that? Can’t you see how important that is to me? To my child?
Get out. I want you to go. Please? I don’t want you here. 
I just… I didn’t expect to feel this nervous. 
What am I doing?
Thank you. You are the closest thing I have to a real father.
I’m so glad you’re here. 
You killed him?
Stop. It’s me, remember? Your ex-wife who shot the Attorney General and was publicly branded a Russian sleeper agent. I know a little something about baggage. But I love you. And I am willing to help you carry yours if you can help me carry mine. 
What are you doing here?
Reddington. It’s her, isn’t it? Solomon’s employer. It’s my mother. Who else would call me Masha Rostova?
Then who is it? Who? You owe me this.
We’re not all out of options here. Nobody has to get hurt.
You want me to ask those poor, terrified people what they think?
I’m coming out!
This is on you.
No one’s keeping me anywhere.
Don’t you get it? I’m the only one in this building they’re not gonna shoot.
The baby.
No promises.
Yeah.
I want to keep the baby. Our baby. [ Sniffles ]
They had a cancellation at the church this afternoon, I say we go for it. We do it now, today.
No, but don’t slow down now.
I don’t think so. I avoided the bullets, anyway.
Reddington’s lying to me. I know it. If my mother wasn’t trying to abduct me, why’d Solomon ask for Masha?
If that woman knew Reddington, she would. She’d know it’s the only way to pry me out of his grip. But where’s she been all this time? And why’d Reddington say she’s dead?
[ Sighs ] [ Cellphone vibrates ] Yeah. Okay, you promised to tell me what’s going on. Who sent the army?
What do you think? That was supposed to be our wedding?
Everyone.
I’ll take it under advisement. 
I wish people would stop asking me that.
Don’t worry. They’re not gonna shoot me.
Aah!
No, Tom, I can’t run.
[ Sighs ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
Yeah, I know. I’m not okay. The car wreck. Something hurts inside.
What about the baby?
[ Sighs ] Oh, my God. We’re terrible parents.
[ Gasps ] Oh, my God, the baby! [ Breathing heavily ]
[ Exhales deeply ] 
Is the baby okay? That’s all I care about.
[ Sighs ] I don’t want to talk to him.
What?
[ Sighs ] Did you hear a word Tom just said?
You can’t protect me in a church, either.
[ Exhales deeply ] 
I know what that means.
[ Groans ]
[ Gasps ]
My water just broke.
Ohh! From where? Three minutes out from where? An abandoned warehouse? Because I let a fugitive, a killer, a sociopath into my life…
…now I am being hunted by God knows who’s chasing me, but they’ve got body armor and assault rifles, and I have to give birth to my child– to a baby!– in a filthy warehouse!
Is that supposed to make me feel better?
I should have known it’d be you on call.
Nothing good.
[ Sighing ] Okay.
Really? Wow. Okay.
Nik, please just tell me nothing’s gonna happen to the baby.
[ Breathing heavily ]
Ohh. I love you.
This just isn’t how I pictured the birth of our baby.
Magical.
Adhesions? Is that bad? 
Um, when I was 15. 
Definitely. Please. 
Is everything okay?
Hi! A girl! Hi.
I still like Agnes.
But with babies, everything that’s old is new again.♤ [ Chuckles ] Besides, it was Sam’s mother’s name. He’s the only family I ever knew.
[ Sharply ] No. Get out. Please, go away. [ To Tom: ] Make him go away.
It’s not the drugs. This is my daughter. I’m begging you.
My chest.
If things go sideways, you’re gonna take our baby to that beach, right?
I’m sorry I kicked you out. It wasn’t fair after all you’ve done for me.
I’m scared for my little girl.
I don’t want that for her.
Oh, Raymond. I do love… 
(SIGHS) You made it. Oh, my God. [ Takes the baby ] Oh. Oh, she’s beautiful.
Are we okay?
[ To Red: ] No. Get out. Please, go away. Make him go away. This is my daughter.
My daughter, my husband… where are they? What have you done with them? 
Who are you?
That’s what you said before.
My name is Elizabeth.
You’re not my father.
What job? With Tom? What are you doing to Tom? 
You kidnapped my infant daughter, my husband, and me. I’d say you’re capable of anything.
If you cared so much about me, you wouldn’t hold me hostage.
Attack my wedding, everyone I love.
And Tom? 
I’m on your left.
I don’t have her. Go. Find Agnes and Tom.
If they get you, they’ll kill you.
Good.
Even better.
Oh, baby. Are you okay, sweetheart? [ Exhales sharply ] Let me look at you. [ Cries ] Oh, you’re okay. Oh, my God. [ Sniffles ] It’s okay. You’re a strong girl. Everything’s gonna be okay. You’re with Mommy now. Shh.
Tom.
You lost Tom.
Where?
I’m not going anywhere with you. I faked my death to have a normal life. There’s nothing normal about being held prisoner.
She’s hungry, which means I need to feed her, which means you need to leave.
Shh, shh, shh. Shh. Shh. [ Crying continues ] Please, Agnes, stop crying. Mommy’s here. Shh, shh, shh. [ Agnes continues crying ]
Think about what you’re doing. What are you gonna do? Hurt me? Hurt my baby? Kirk will kill you if you do. Are you a mother? Do you have children? Look at her…
No! [ She holds her hands up. Agnes resumes crying ]
Like hell we are. No!
Agnes!
Tom’s alive. You don’t have Agnes. I’m not worried about anything.
Even if it means destroying mine.
And you hate him for it, for stealing your child. I know how that feels.
Yes. But then again, so would you.
Mayday, mayday, mayday. Plane down off the coast of Havana. 23 degrees, 52 minutes north.
82 degrees, 49 minutes south. Mayday, mayday, mayday. Can anyone hear me?
Gone.
Mayday, mayday, mayday, is anyone there?
One of the pontoons is taking on water. We don’t have long.
Watch me.
You mean my only chance. [ Unzips pocket ] You’re not going anywhere. [ Seat belt clicks ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Gunshot (flare) 💥 ]
I’ll never trust you.
They’re looking. The FBI, the Coast Guard. They’ll find us.
No. No!
I can help you.
You said we have to trust each other. Do you trust me?
Then hold on. They will find us. They will find us. 
Hey, stay awake. Stay with me. Talk to me. Tell me, uh, about your parents. What were their names?
Help! Over here! Help!
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Uh, he needs medical attention. First aid? Uh, do you understand? Medicina.
Good, good. Show me. He needs it right now. Right now.
Because you know where Agnes is.
ou need to keep pressure on that leg. You’ve lost a lot of blood.
I saved you because of Agnes, but… also maybe because you might be telling the truth.
Me llamo Elizabeth Keen. I’m with the FBI. That man was in my custody when our plane crashed.
No, no, no, no. Uh… Señor… terrorist. Muy malo. Muy malo.
[ Whispers ] Shh, shh, shh, yes. Uh, necesito un radio.
[ Speaking Spanish ] Do you have a gun? ¿Pistola?
Uh, I don’t– No comprendo.
No, slow down. Please slow down…
If this man dies–
Three passengers, and make sure there’s a medical team standing by.
Of course you believe that. You’re a classic narcissist. You were, what, abused as a child? Abandoned? Made to feel powerless? You must’ve suffered some sick, traumatic, dark event to believe that the sick, traumatic dark things you’ve done to me and everyone I care about could ever result in me loving you. 
Where is she?
Hi, Agnes. Hi.
Did you hear that? We’re gonna be together soon.
I love you. 
What is this place?
The armed goons don’t do much for the landscape.
Like a Russian fairy tale.
Palace? The Summer Palace. It’s what Mr. Kirk calls the cottage. Anything you need during your stay, let me know. 
Yes. My daughter.
Tell me about Kirk. How long have you known him?
So you know him well?
This was my bedroom.
But… there was a fire. I… I shot my father. I remember.
But it can’t be true.
Where are we?
What is this place?
Kirk thinks Agnes is his granddaughter, so he won’t hurt her.
I don’t know what to believe, but after what happened, it’s possible.
A memory, of being at that house.
According to Kirk, he was just doing whatever it took to get his daughter away from Reddington. Look how far we went to do the same thing.
“Some”? This is our case.
Ressler, why not?
Look… I’m sorry. I never wanted to hurt anybody.
No. It’s okay. We knew what pain it would cause, and we did it anyway to protect our daughter. I know you may not accept it, but I hope you can at least understand.
Reddington.
This is where you wanted to meet?
Where is Mr. Kaplan?
Alexander Kirk says he’s my father.
Do you have any leads?
What? Who?
[ Sighs ] I know you feel betrayed. Samar and Aram feel betrayed. Everyone feels betrayed. But… my daughter is missing, and if you have any idea how to find her, you’ve got to tell me. Red: No, I don’t. I expected Kirk to go underground after the FBI’s raid at his estate. He didn’t. I have it on good authority he reached out to a… uniquely inventive young man named Miles McGrath.
Who is that?
And you really believe that if we find McGrath, he’ll lead us to Kirk?
Not us. Me. 
Miles McGrath was a child prodigy. He wrote the code for OnScreen when he was at Princeton.
He founded it. Within a couple of years, the board of directors concluded he was a high-functioning sociopath and pushed him out. He sued them, won the suit for over $100 million. He turned his back on legitimate business. He invested his money in a new business– incubating crimes.
Criminals come to him, pitch their business plan. If he likes it, he invests his money in exchange for a cut of the profits.
I don’t know. All Reddington told me was that he was staying at the Sovereign Royale tonight on business in London. Reddington is currently flying over, hopes to drop in on him in the morning.
Tom, please.
Tom!
[ Voice breaking ] I’m sorry. I just need a minute.
It’s okay.
Mark Savino’s office, please.
Mark, hi. This is Diane up in Gerald Walker’s office. Listen, Gerry just got a surprise visit from Tom and Elizabeth Keen, and, well, they’re very interested to know where we are with the whole case.
Look, it can’t wait. They’re very upset, and she asked to speak with you directly. I told them to wait in Conference Room 9.
[ Whispers to Tom ] Let’s just go.
I know, and I’m sure he’s given us all he can. Thank you so much for your time. I’m sorry.
About Agnes? Maybe. About my mother? Definitely. 
Agnes…
Yeah. My mother’s journal. She talks about you. About the affair. I’m up to the part where she writes about you pressuring her to leave her husband.
I promised to trust him. He made me swear not to interfere.
Oh, thank God. Aram, hold backup.
Reddington didn’t just have an affair with my mother. She was assigned to him, to be in his life… the way you were assigned to be in mine.
Be careful, okay? I lost Agnes. I can’t lose you, too.
Thank you for doing this, Samar. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it.
She hates me.
We all do? You hate me, too?
[ On phone ] Well, then who does have the authority?
[ On phone ] Then get him on the phone.
[ Hangs up ] That was CDC’s Washington Director.
Six containers holding samples of every Class A infectious substance– Ebola, dengue, polio, HIV, and maybe 50 others.
That’s why McGrath had Halbeck shut down the substations near Savannah.
What’s wrong?
[ Phone ]Tom, if can you hear us, say something.
Tom, Tom! If you can hear us, say something. Tom? 
That was HRT on the line. They’re sending a Blackhawk with HRT operatives out of Quantico. They can jump down onto the roof of the train.
Wait. Halbeck and McGrath built a second rail line?
Where?
I know that name. One of the most deadly viral pathogens we know of– killed tens of thousands in Europe and Asia in the early 1900s.
You lost him.
I think I know why Kirk wanted that virus. I saw him getting a blood transfusion at Cape Breton. My mother wrote about his family’s history. Generations of Rostovs had the same disease– a rare blood disorder that’s been killing them for centuries.
No one could be that desperate.
Well, he doesn’t have me.
Where is she?
Where’s my daughter?!
(SNIFFLES, SIGHS) If you so much as… If you hurt her… I know the truth. The only reason you came for me… the only reason you want Agnes is because what’s killing you, it’s a genetic disease, and you think we can cure you, that our blood can…
Hi, baby. 
You don’t think he’s thought of that? The second he discovers we traced it, he’ll take it away, take her away.
I don’t think he’ll hurt her.
If he hurts her, he loses me.
What does Kirk want more than anything in the world? For me to trust him… to care for him. And because it’s what he desires most, it’s the easiest way to deceive him. He’ll see what he wants to see… my affection. He won’t see what’s real… my deception. This link is an opportunity for me to get close to Kirk. And I can’t do anything to jeopardize that.
I know you think that. And I’m asking you to trust me. 
Dembe said you had a lead on Agnes.
Climate change?
Okay, so, the connection between this Earth Mother and Agnes is what?
No, he hasn’t.
A stealth eco-terrorist? Isn’t that an oxymoron?
2011, 10,000 gallons of MCHM, a toxic chemical used to wash coal, was leaked from the Fullerton Chemical Plant. Now, this spill made it into the drinking water in the local towns. A few hundred people were poisoned, including two children and three elderly victims who later died. Environmentalists had warned of the danger of a spill for years, but no one listened until this leak, and then the EPA finally mandated changes.
Reddington won’t say.
So that’s this guy’s M.O. He’s not breaking into these facilities. He’s walking through the front door.
That’s our guy.
I think we’ve got something. We put out a general alert to all government and private facilities… oil and gas, chemical plants.
A gas pipeline inspector in Newark was found dead in his car this morning. Heart attack.
Maybe, but he had an appointment to evaluate a gas pipeline in Westchester County.
Yeah, but how? We didn’t find any explosives. What was he doing?
Nowhere. But Reddington says he’s got a guy who might be able to help.
Um… he’s withdrawn, a loner, and yet he’s committed to making the world a cleaner place. Photo of a pregnant woman. But no child. Maybe the child was taken or… or died.
Tidal charts for the Hudson.
I’m looking at our little girl. It’s almost like a baby monitor, like she’s in the next room.
I know. I asked you this morning to trust me, not to trace the link. I want you to know it means everything to me that you are okay with that. Thank you.
Okay. I love you.
But wait. Don’t…
About what? What are you talking about?
No. No, I didn’t. There must be some mistake. Wait. That had nothing to do with me.
No, I told Tom. I specifically said…
No! Please bring her back! I’m begging you! Bring her back! 
[ Picks up phone ] Tom, what the hell did you… No, n-no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me, Doctor. Um… I was just, uh… Doesn’t matter. The tidal charts… Were you able to review them? 
[ Rushing in ] It’s worse than we thought. The tidal charts… Can you pull them up?
He wasn’t just tracking the tides in the Hudson. He was calculating the exact time of the supermoon. It happens only every couple of decades.
These charts identify exactly when the Hudson will be at its lowest.
Over 2 billion gallons per day. Now, we know that an explosion on the pipeline will cause damage to the reactor at Stone Park, but what if, on top of that damage, the reactor couldn’t get enough water to cool the core?
Any time within the next hour and a half.
Two minutes. Maybe less.
One minute.
We talked about this! We agreed!
What you didn’t tell me was that you were gonna do something about it. Instead, you went behind my back and did exactly what I told you not to do. And with Reddington’s help, no doubt. Tom: It wasn’t Reddington.
Then who?
When was this? When you were a skinhead? One of Berlin’s thugs? ‘Cause I’m guessing it wasn’t an elementary-school teacher.
Oh, no. I know someone who’s sorrier. 
Our daughter… who now, because of you, is God knows where.
I lied to you. You asked if Kirk had reached out, and I told you he hadn’t. That wasn’t true.
He set up a link… a video feed so I could see Agnes.
Tom tried to trace the link, tried to find Agnes, but Kirk found out, and now, uh…
I thought I could make it better, that I could protect my baby. 
I mean, that’s my one job… to protect my child. Make her feel safe at any cost. To hold her. (VOICE BREAKING) To tell her everything’s gonna be okay. (SNIFFLES) But now because of me, because of what I’ve done, I can’t even do that.
Conversation about what?
You don’t have to apologize for trying to find our daughter.
Agnes is missing because of Kirk’s obsession with me.
Look, if I were you and our daughter were missing because of something that had nothing to do with me… What I believe is that we should do everything we can to bring our daughter home.
Not if. When.
Let me guess. You and the pastor are dear friends.
You’re squatting in a church.
Did you get Kirk’s doctor?
I want to be there when he does.
Don’t change the subject.
Why? Who are they?
Companies do that all the time– buy up patents just to shelve them. Big oil did it to the NiMH battery in the ’90s.
I’ll call it in, but if you have a line on Kirk, I’m staying with you.
You’ve seen Agnes?
Where is she?
You could be asking me that about either of them.
Listen to me, this doesn’t need to be another one of your scorched-earth raids.
He admires Kirk, says he’s a good man.
I’m in the middle. Between you and Kirk, between Tom and Kirk. Can you at least admit how difficult that is?
At the church, what was Dembe praying for?
Are you planning an extraction or a land war in Asia?
What do you mean? I’m going with you.
I gave you the satellite intel on Kirk’s location. I’m the reason you’re able to get him.
I’m not going anywhere.
[ On phone ] You’re never gonna believe what I’m doing.
Nothing– We found Kirk. He’s in Geneva. Our first lead and Reddington literally leaves me behind with a couple of armed guards.
That’s where Kirk’s meeting his doctor. He’s headed there now.
What are you talking about?
That Kirk’s in Russia?
I need to call you back.
Put him on.
Tell him it’s a trap. You’re walking into a trap
What happened? Is everyone okay?
You don’t think… I called to warn you.
You don’t sound convinced.
But that’s because you can’t seem to accept that Kirk has answers to questions I’ve been asking my entire life.
We didn’t get Agnes.
Did you find something about Agnes?
Then what difference does it make?
What’s this?
You lied to me about everything.
A DNA report. Proof that Alexander Kirk is my father. You told me my father was dead, that I killed him. Everything you’ve said from the start, from the very beginning… all lies.
Why bother when you can have us arrest him and then take his place?
Finding my daughter? No, it isn’t. Apparently, empire building takes precedence.
You’re always giving us someone’s six degrees of separation from Kirk.
And kill Kirk.
Alexander Kirk is my father.
Yes. DNA evidence of who my father is and who’s been lying to me for the past three years.
I’ll do my job, but I am done cozying up to that snake.
We’ve been breached.
Yes. Our public disagreement was staged for Kirk’s benefit.
Not who.
Our system. It’s been hacked.
After that, The Thrushes went underground. Their specialty is not only cracking systems, but doing so without leaving a trace of their intrusion.
2009… The Ankara-Istanbul high-speed railway system. Faulty ultrasound software failed to detect stress fractures, leading to a disastrous test run, costing the Turkish government billions.
Last year… a top-secret nuclear fuel enrichment plant outside of Jaipur, India. Motor-speed variations destroyed 1,200 industrial centrifuges.
Like the conversation we had in your office. If Kirk thinks I’m done with Reddington, he might reach out.
Oh, it wasn’t an act. I’m only putting up with Reddington and his lies until we get Agnes back. 
How nice. All I need now is a barbed-wire fence and guard towers.
You mean my father?
Not just the DNA. It’s memories… Places I recognize, things we did together. A time capsule we buried in the yard that no one else would know about.
You know what you sound like? Desperate. Just a suspect caught in a lie.
Yes? This is she. I’ll be along shortly. Thanks.
[ To Red ] That was a shoe-repair shop in Georgetown I’ve never even heard of. He says I left my phone there.
There’s only one number saved. International prefix 40.
Tell me about Agnes.
You could make that happen.
I got your SVR file. Your DNA profile was in it. I know you’re my father.
Yes.
What are you suggesting?
That won’t be easy. Reddington has his goons guarding me 24/7.
[ Speaks Russian ]
That’s because I meant every word.
He’s my father.
You know what’s gonna happen if I make that call. He’s the only one who can give me answers about my past, my mother. They’ll put him in a hole. I’ll never see him again.
She’s our daughter.
You abducted me once. What assurances do I have you won’t do it again?
I want this to be real.
By phone?
So what you’re saying is you heard her say the tap was clean, but, for all you know, she could have been sending some kind of message, a signal that everything was not okay.
What I’m suggesting is Kirk’s supposed to be the one walking into a trap here, not me. Cooper: We’ll have safeguards in place. Your security won’t be compromised.
That is my only concern. Clearly your only concern is that it might actually bother me that I’m about to entrap my biological father, that because of me, he’s gonna go to prison for the rest of his life. If I go through with this, you will be my only link to my past. I lost Sam. I lost my mother. And I’ll lose Kirk. And whatever you want to call him, he was married to my mother. He raised me as a child. And he’s willing to do what you are not… Tell me about who I am.
[ Sighs ] The meeting’s set. 5:30 a.m.
No. I’m not sure about any of this. 
It’s off. We can’t meet. It’s not safe.
The FBI knows about your mole. They’ve got her in custody. [ Beep ] Reddington must have tipped them. They know about our meeting… The time, the location. I’m telling you, it’s a trap.
It’s not just the FBI. Reddington knows.
Where’s Agnes?
You said three of us. Where is she?
What are you talking about?
That wasn’t our agreement.
 I picked you… over him. I lied to everyone for you. Now you want to kill him? You can’t do that.
I know you’re sick. I know that Agnes and I are nothing more than possible donors for you.
We had a deal.
[ Gasps ] You’ll see, solnishko. Soon, you will be free.
Don’t shoot! He’s got Agnes!
[ Speaks Russian ] Don’t do this.
And I hate him as much as you do for it. But if you love me, if you ever loved me, just give her to me. Please. Otets. Please, father.
Not really. Considering what was at stake. 
Yeah, she is. 
So… now that Kirk has been captured, we’re no longer gonna live under your guard. We’re gonna find a place of our own.
If there’s a reason you felt this story couldn’t wait, I’d love to hear it, but quickly if possible.
[ Sighs ] I just got my baby back, my husband, my family. This can wait.
Lionfish?
Whatever destruction Kirk has caused is over.
Kirk isn’t wriggling anywhere.
We caught the Thrushes, arrested his mole. Who else is there?
You think I’m gonna help Kirk escape?
Fine. I’ll bite. Tell me more. 
According to Reddington, The Coroner runs a witness protection program for criminals. He provides them with new lives, fully documented from cradle to present. Then he takes the identities of the dead and somehow manages to keep them alive on paper– elementary school report cards, marriage licenses, confirmation certificates. He then takes these meticulously crafted identities and sells them to the world’s most dangerous criminals.
Reddington believes Kirk is going to escape and that when he does, the Coroner will help him vanish.
People are creatures of habit. They gravitate to what they know. Barerra may have gotten a new life, a new identity, but she’s still the same person with the same skill set. And we figured she’d use one of them to make a living.
He said he won’t talk to anyone without a lawyer present.
I feel like you deserve some clarity on what’s about to happen. They’re transferring you to Fort McNair, where you’ll be held until your initial hearing. You’ll have access to your lawyers–
Yes.
I picked myself. You said you were trying to protect Agnes from Reddington, and that’s my decision to make– and Tom’s. But no one else’s. Not even my father’s.
Whatever stories you have–
I’m not helping you escape.
Alexander?
Kirk?
Enter the code! Open the door right now!
He’s not breathing! Get a medic in here now! 
He’s been receiving transfusions for many years.
And if you don’t?
[ On phone ] How’s Agnes?
I know. I’m sorry I didn’t call. Kirk collapsed in the Post Office.
His only hope is for a blood relative to donate stem cells.
I just wanted to talk to you about it.
And for that, he’ll spend the rest of his life in prison. I’m not talking about freeing him. I’m talking about saving his life.
Because he’s my father.
It’s not that simple.
What if we were talking about your father? What if you suddenly found him? Would you be able to walk away?
I don’t believe that for a second.
Wait, wait, wait. You met your mother?
Why didn’t you tell me?
How did it happen? What was she like? You must have a million questions.
You’re telling me you met your mother whom you’ve never known and you were able to just… walk away?
Colonel Wright–
What happened?
I’m Alexander Kirk’s daughter.
I wasn’t sure I wanted to help.
If I am, what do I need to do? 
It sounds worse than it is.
They put me on dialysis and collect the cells. And if they get enough, they transfuse them to Kirk.
It could if we’re compatible.
Apparently, that’s no guarantee. They test for 16 genetic markers, and that’s after they check to see that our blood types are a match.
[ Sighs ] Reddington said I’d save him. Tom will never forgive me if I do.
What do you think I should do?
Maybe not. But I’m afraid I would. 
How you feeling?
Travel the world with my family… twice.
Sure. But like my dad always said, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride. My adopted dad, Sam Milhoan.
I don’t understand.
Which you’ll have plenty of time to spend, because you’re not dying. Not now, anyway. I told your doctor that I’ve decided to be your donor. They’re running the tests now to confirm we’re a match.
Because you didn’t ask.
Don’t say it.
I didn’t ignore it. I just… didn’t agree.
Risks for me? None.
All I have to do is give blood. [ Sighs ] I should’ve told you sooner. I’m sorry. Just everything is happening so fast.
I promise.
How’d I do?
So what happens now?
And if those are risks I’m willing to take?
You sent my blood out for testing hours ago.
And if he dies before the tests come back confirming I’m a match?
He’s gonna die because a bus accident delayed some lab work, and all the answers I’m looking for are gonna die with him.
Do you have the lab results?
I know I’m breaking my promise. But I have to do this.
I was.
I tried to.
No.
The test results–
You don’t understand. I…
It’s not just that we weren’t compatible. The test results showed something else. I’m not your daughter. 
It doesn’t make any sense. I saw the DNA test.
And the things he knows about me, he wasn’t pretending. He believed he was my father. So did I.
This whole time, Reddington was right.
What are you doing?
You’d rather go back to the Box? They can make you comfortable here.
I thought it was a mistake, too.
I had the lab rerun the test. It came back the same way.
Did you manipulate the test?
I just showed Kirk DNA proof he’s not my father, and he blames you for faking the test.
Don’t change the subject.
He’s under federal guard. There are marshals with tactical gear watching every entrance. What’s he gonna do?
Enter the code!
Tell your team to expect a full military assault.
I just got off the phone with Reddington. He has reason to believe Kirk’s men are coming to break him out. 
Call it off.
If you try to escape, innocent people will die. 
Even if you could get out, what’s the point? You are sick.
I know you don’t wanna believe this, but those test results…
No, they’re real. I’m not your daughter.
Maybe. I don’t know. But I do know that I can’t save your life. And you aren’t going anywhere.
Has anyone seen Tom?
What doesn’t?
Reddington.
Tom!
Tom!
Tom better not be dead.
He better not be dead.
I’m not giving you my blood.
You shouldn’t have come.
Let him go.
You want me to remember you that way? Let Reddington go.
I’ll come for you. I’ll come for you.
What good is killing me gonna do? It won’t bring him back. He’s gonna die. He can’t be saved.
He’s dying because he’s sick.
You’re going to jail.
Yeah. He traded himself for me.
There were no signs, no markers. They had my head covered going in and out.
I’d say we drove 15, maybe 20 minutes.
No, we’re not. I have an idea. 
Aram, I have a question. If the van Kirk’s guys were using has a GPS system, could you use that to retrace where it’s been?
Okay, I’m standing at the van. What do you need to make that happen? 
The site had an underground parking structure. Does that help you filter the search?
Oh, my God. How did you…
Kirk?
Dead?
I don’t… I don’t understand. How did you…
Mm. Come here. Come here. Yes. [ Sighs ] Here you go.
You know, I really believed he was my father.
Except for one. You. You told me my father died when I was a little girl. I just… I guess I didn’t want to believe it. I really wanted my dad here to see her grow up.
[ Sweetly ] When you were a little baby, you lived in a warehouse. And we had bodyguards. Say hi, Baz. [ Baz walks up, smiles, waves ]
And inside the warehouse was… a fake apartment! Oh, look! It’s your daddy in your fake living room.
Well, it’ll make for an intriguing college essay.
I don’t know. With Reddington, I don’t assume anything.
You’re the one that told me that’s in my past.
That’s totally understandable. And another day, I might feel differently, but this is our present and our future. That’s all that matters.
Yeah.
Let’s start by finding her a place to live. She needs to be able to open up her living room windows and see the sun.
[ Sighs ] We all do. 
So is Reddington saying the New Martyrs were building some kind of mass casualty weapon to use here?
What’s up with Aram?
Our national security threat just became a national security leak.
That would be… amazing. But do you think that’s even possible?
Here’s a tip, Mr. Maddox. Next time you wanna appear innocent, don’t run from the FBI.
It’s been a tough few months for you, James. You lost your family, you lost your job, started drinking again.
We talked to Blackthorn. You had access to that chip.
I don’t think you gave it to them. I think you sold it to them. Look, tell me the truth now, and maybe I can still help you.
Something’s off. It’s just a read, but his denial seems genuine.
A month ago, but for some reason didn’t bother coming forward until after the company had already served up Maddox on a silver platter. I’m telling you, something’s off about this.
Nothing she can do now or ever? Sir, what’d she say?
 Yeah, so am I. 
Reddington, we need your help. Samar’s been abducted. The NMB just took her.
I’m putting you on a speaker. [ Beep ] We’re sending you everything, all the search results for possible NMB members coming into the country, all the flights and profiles we’ve ruled out. Maybe we missed something.
She did, why? 
Did she just say…
It was Reddington. He got the President of the United States to pardon me. How does he do that?
I hate to leave you here with all this.
[ Laughs ] Everything’s coming together for us.
We’ve got Agnes back. We’ve got each other. I’m an agent again.
It’s a lot to give up.
Oh! [ Chuckles ] Okay, now I’m jealous. [ Chuckles ] 
Tom. 
I just found this outside my front door.
No, like a warning– or a cry for help.
That’s not a cape. That’s a judge’s robe. Federal Judge Trisha Culpepper drowned in her country club pool this morning. The guard at the club saw her enter around 8 AM and then, 30 minutes later, 9-1-1 received a call from an employee saying she drowned.
No, the guard saw her at 8 AM. I found this around 7 AM– an hour before she drowned.
I already contacted the New York field office. They’re sending me my files now.
I don’t want to know how you did it or what it says about the fate of our country that you were able to, but I wanna thank you for getting the President of the United States to pardon me.
You looked at the photos I sent.
I’ve looked at every case file from my time at the Mobile Psych Unit, and no suspect’s an obvious match.
A partial print, but inconclusive.
No, that’s not necessary. Whoever’s doing this does not want to hurt me. They wanna match wits with me, see if I can catch them.
But you don’t even know who this is.
I just got word from the lab. They were able to pull a print from a handrail outside my apartment. It matches a partial we pulled from the first model. Suspect’s name is Fiona Driscoll. 
Down! Get down!
You okay?
FBI. 
Hello, Ms. Driscoll.
We have your fingerprints on the renderings of crime scenes you left outside my home.
We found traces of aconitine in the judge’s system. You poisoned her and then tried to murder Marlon Milch.
Models of crime scenes made before the crimes were committed.
Why haven’t you taken these premonitions to the police?
When did these premonitions start?
So there are more dioramas. 
How do you get these visions?
Maggie’s visions, when did they start?
Were they any changes in your life at the time? Had you moved? Did she change schools?
What is she working on now?
These aren’t just crimes, these are catastrophic events happening all around the world.
Her mother says she has an undiagnosed cognitive disorder.
Tom.
Cooper insisted, but the person who delivered the dioramas wasn’t the killer. It was a mom whose daughter somehow knows about crimes that haven’t been committed yet.
Tell me about Agnes.
You are helping.
I do. And I appreciate that. But for now, we’re good. I’ll call you if anything changes.
Aram, where are they? 
How much of it do you think she actually understands?
Fifth floor, fourth apartment from the end. The east wing.
How did we miss him?
How?
[ To Aram: ] Turn it down.
When did he get out?
 He’s a college dropout with a felony record. I doubt he came up with this on his own.
No, but we know someone who does. 
And determined. 
The stop! Where’s the emergency stop?
Uh, what was that about?
We lost one of the killers.
Who were those two?
I know you’ve been concerned about me, about a killer knowing where I live. I just wanted you to know you’ve got nothing to worry about anymore.
Not yet. [ Chuckles softly ] Maybe someday.
[ Sighs ] I’ve been working on this, so let me know what you think.
All right, bon appétit.
What is this?
Yeah. It wasn’t a lie, it was a hope.
And wondering whether or not that’s possible is totally natural.
Thank you.
Good. This is exactly where they belong. David… Lucas, and… Kaya. I used to be scared of those guys. Not anymore.
We could use a little peace and quiet in our lives. [ Door creaks ] Dembe. Is everything okay?
Please come in.
And you think I can.
He wouldn’t tell me who they were.
Cleaners? What about Mr. Kaplan? It’s because she helped me fake my death, isn’t it? He’s punishing her.
So he’s replacing her.
[ Sternly ] I’m an FBI agent. Mr. Reddington is my CI, which forces me to ignore his crimes, which will no doubt include murdering you if either of you ever tell anyone. On the other hand, I am under no obligation to ignore your crimes. So before you commit any while I’m here, I suggest you all run along.
You said you had a case.
A car with its own security guards?
Ew.
Every one of those witnesses would be in danger if their identities get out.
How exactly are we supposed to catch them in the act? –
The Harem is responsible for a number of high-line thefts. The disappearance of half a dozen paintings from the Ostergard Museum in Denmark in 2012.
Not before the Harem stole the paintings from them. Lowry Fool’s Gold, a Mexican drug lord’s prized race horse, went missing in 2014. Reddington says The Harem auctioned it for $6 million. And when they hit the National Bank of Belize, they emptied out the top-secret safety deposit box of a French arms dealer. The leader of The Harem is a woman named Margot Rochet. She’s staying at The Fairborne under the alias Kate Morgan.
Reddington says he knows someone she worked with in the past who can vouch for me. 
We’ll go over our story until we forget it’s a lie.
Sorry to disturb you, ma’am. I need to check the mini bar.
I’m so sorry. Hotel policy. I can come back later, but I would have to come back.
I’ll give you 73.
My name’s Liz Crawford. I wanna join The Harem.
I read people. I tell people exactly what they need to hear in order to do exactly what I need them to do. I got oil men in North Dakota to invest in a bogus casino deal. Did a couple runaway bride gigs. Worked with Craig Gaynier. He could vouch for me.
Take was $2 million.
[ Echoes him ] ‘…everything in this business.’  I remember.
I understand.
Shoot him yourself.
No, you gave me a test, and I’m gonna tell you why I passed. You don’t need blind followers. What you’re interested in is loyalty. I worked with Craig. I’m loyal to him. Take me on, I’ll be equally loyal to you.
I’m sorry. I-I didn’t mean to…
Oh, that wasn’t a dog. That was a wooly mammoth.
Chatty?
That’s embarrassing. I mean, how embarrassing was it?
Good. That’s a relief.
How revealing was it, exactly?
What kind of leverage?
We’re going to Nevada?
Or maybe we don’t.
Whoo.
I know you’re missing 72 stones just like that one. You want ’em back? Be at the Menchaca Produce warehouse tomorrow morning at 10:00.
I don’t walk out of here in 30 seconds, you’ll never see your diamonds again.
No, I didn’t. I said you’d get them back if you went to the warehouse. You didn’t. Now we get to talk in private.
Ever heard of the hacker Helldritch?
I don’t know. Giannusa’s contact with him was digital. As soon as we get a location, we move.
Margot’s on board. Emma… something’s off. Has Aram had any luck with her background?
Tell him to keep looking. I’ll do some digging of my own. I wanna figure out who this woman is. Something feels off about her. 
She works for you?
So, what? She could tell you what they were planning to steal so you could steal it first?
If you already had someone inside, then why add me?
You’re telling me she turned. Who is she anyway? Aram says her records have all been scrubbed.
So she’s a British agent?
She knows who I am.
You wouldn’t have put me in if she had been reporting back to you. So whether or not she can be trusted remains to be seen.
What’s so urgent?
To Helldritch? That was fast.
How long has it been?
Reddington works for MI-6?
Why would you ever do that?
It’s never too late.
Margot’s contact says Helldritch is in Hong Kong.
Our only shot at recovering the WITSEC list is to have The Harem steal it, and I’ve got to be there.
She won’t.
We can’t let The Harem steal the WITSEC list and run with it.
I know you’re worried about me, and I appreciate it. But I trust her. I’ll make contact from Hong Kong. 
Ooh. [ Exhales slowly ] [ Sighs ]
Whoa.
Listen, uh…
To the group.
 About last night.
You protected me.
You act like it’s too late. It isn’t. You could still get out.
[ Whispers ] I can help you. The WITSEC list, when we get it back, I can get you on it. Testify against Margot. Start over. 
I’ve got eyes on the target.
Congratulations on your citizenship.
I heard you’re a man of many talents.
You’re able to find certain people.
I think you do. The WITSEC list. Tony Giannusa and I are friends. Got anywhere we can talk business?
Get something to restrain him!
Jessica, find something!
Got it. Hey, we gotta go. You’re good.
Hey, are you okay?
Uh, go. We’ll be right behind you.
She took the chip.
She’s using our exit strategy. We gotta get out of here.
Jessica’s down!
Screw protocol! Jessica’s dead! Emma’s got the list.
Wait, wait. What about Emma? Margot! Margot!
I’m gonna need your security badge and your phone. 
[ On phone ] The whole thing went sideways. Jessica’s dead. The rest of the Harem, I don’t know. They split up. Margot and Sasha are leaving the country under aliases– Eva Taylor and Lily Hum. Aram, can you–
Emma took it. You were right.
Clearly, I don’t.
She burned MI-6. Burned Reddington, The Harem. She has nowhere to go. Oh, my God. That’s it.
Emma’s disappeared. 
You got to her before we could?
She betrayed you, so you… killed her just like you killed Mr. Kaplan?
And I’m just supposed to look the other way, right? Just like I looked the other way from all the terrible things you do because they’re for the greater good, just like this list. You wanna kill someone the government’s protecting, but you can’t find them, so you had us… find this list for you.
Who is she to you?
This doesn’t excuse what you’ve done.
Problems?
What kinds of transactions?
I think I’ve heard enough.
And this affects the fate of the free world how?
What do you need from us?
Roughly 14 hours ago, Zack Smoll was found dead in the Gentle Bliss Massage Parlor. ME’s initial report describes symptoms consistent with acute meningitis.
He didn’t say. But if he’s coming to us with this, it means he’s desperate.
It means whatever killed Smoll is a lot more dangerous than meningitis.
Any idea what we’re dealing with?
So how did Smoll get infected?
And you’ve got something?
Should I have?
Typhoid Mary.
Malik Roumain born to immigrant parents. Full-boat to Berkeley at 17. The American dream. By 23, he had his PhD in biochemistry from Johns Hopkins and turned down a number of highly paid offers to accept a post-doc at Hawthorne.
Talk about forbidden love.
That’s him. He must’ve registered the car under an alias.
How obscene?
Just like everything else is to you. A game. Where’s Tom?
You know, Tom and I were just starting to find some semblance of normalcy. And you had to just sweep in, drag him back down your rabbit hole. There must be dozens of contract operatives just like him. Why him?
How’d it go?
We just arrested a woman who would’ve done anything to stay with the person she loved, but she lost him anyway.
That’s not what I meant.
From the beginning, we’ve been fighting secrets and agendas and psychotic homicidal killers coming between us. And for the first time, we’re together, and we’ve got no one to fight.
I know this family is the most important thing to you. But it’s not gonna work if you can’t be who you are. I guess I’m just scared.
[ Voice breaks ] I’m not gonna love that person.
Yes.
[ Quietly ] Tom. Tom, honey, wake up. I was feeding Agnes–
No, no, she’s fine. I was watching the news and there was a plane crash. Honey, it was your father’s plane. He died. 
I’m sorry.
Honey, he was your father.
Come on, honey. You must have some questions.
As an operative, which seems like it would be your dream job.
You can care about us and still look for the answers you need.
Where in your empire does he fit in?
You have multiple shipping operations?
Thank you.
Admitting upfront why you’re giving us this case. It’s a refreshing change.
Disinterested.
Why do you say that?
And her next target is you.
Me.
What’s her name?
Dr Eric Bannon, a world-renowned cardiologist, was charged in a series of angel-of-mercy killings, due to lethal prescription drug interactions that were in fact engineered by Isabella Stone.
She hacked Bannon’s passwords in order to access the inpatient dispensary and changed the patients’ prescription drug regimens. Twelve died. Now, according to Reddington’s sources, one of the victims had a brother, Ryuu Fujimoto, who engaged Isabella Stone to orchestrate Bannon’s downfall.
Yes, and one of his accountants. According to our last Blacklister, Natalie Luca …
Stone used her to kill Reddington’s accountant and money-launderer, Zack Smoll.
Against someone we should be interested in taking down anyway.
So what? He’s thirsty.
He’s talking into a mike.
Can you at least confirm the name of the lessee?
Give us a minute, okay? We gotta make a few calls.
We don’t have time for that. For all we know, Murphy’s on his way back from Paris right now. If there is something incriminating in here, then he might come back and get it before we can get a warrant.
Because of Reddington. He needs our help.
We found a pop-up safe house used by one of Stone’s operatives, Charles Murphy. He has dossiers and photographs of Zack Smoll, your courier, and the man you were meeting with the other day.
Sarantos, yeah. And there’s a file on a woman with the same last name, Corina Sarantos? Is that his wife? His sister?
Reddington, wait [ Groans ] 
Isn’t that Judith Pruitt, the one whose husband was arrested?
What if he was innocent? Or Judith thought he was innocent?
Look at the victimology. Dr. Eric Bannon, an esteemed cardiologist, butchering his patients for fat fees. Cynthia Brooks, an international fashion icon, exploiting Third World child labor–
Powerful and guilty as sin, all of them. What better way for the bereaved wife of an innocent man – a powerful man, destroyed, humiliated, imprisoned, and murdered – What better way for her to strike back than to inflict the same fate on the guilty?
This is part of Isabella Stone’s campaign against Reddington. She’s killed others because they worked for Reddington. If Sperry does, too, discrediting him may not be all she has planned.
Agent Keen, FBI.
I’m not looking for Dr. Sperry. I’m looking for this woman. Judith Pruitt.
Do you know where she went? Did she say?
He can drive?
Is there any truth to Stone’s allegations?
You know him?
What did you do?
None. She won’t cooperate. If someone hired her to come after you, she won’t say who.
What is this?
Hey, babe. You know, I was thinking about your dad, and you’re right. [ Door closes ] We should just let it lie. I don’t think that there’s any reason for us to look into your past.
Honey, these are police reports. What do those have to do with your dad?
[ Referring to the video ] Who’s that?
Sounds like a slasher movie.
The location of the convention?
“If foo equals first object oriented.”
Totally what I was gonna say. [ Taps key ]
Hey. Did you talk to Richard Game?
About what? Game confessed to killing you.
But wait. What were you wrong about?
I’ll have a penny candy, please.
Thank you. [ To Ressler: ] Oh, my God, there are so many combinations. This is gonna take hours.
I’ll give this to Aram.
We need to get an agent to that pickup point to get into Black Mass to ID The Architect.
Our techs can’t figure out how their encrypted feeds are being hacked.
Do you know where they’re holding Black Mass?
Because we don’t, and that’s where he is.
Help us locate Black Mass, and he can.
[ On phone ] Did you see the mother?
[ On phone ] Look, I have to go, but I’m gonna make a few calls, see what I can find out. This isn’t over.
Where are you?
When Richard Game confessed to your murder, he had been sick for years. He had a virus called Jenkins-Fowler.
So it’s incredibly contagious. He lived under constant quarantine.
His phone calls were monitored. His letters were screened. Every interaction was supervised by prison doctors.
Or maybe it was the one person allowed unsupervised visitation with Game– his mother.
I thought Cooper said that inquiry was closed.
The mother?
She admitted it. That’s great. Who paid her?
How is that possible?
A script?
[ Reading ] The pajamas you were wearing.
The night light in the hall. 
Is any of this accurate?
You should show this to your mother. She probably knows something.
Based on this, it seems like the only way you will is if you do.
Aram, could you get him a chair, please?
There’s a man. He told me he’s known as–
A druggist whose potions hijack the immune system, causing any number of allergic reactions, each one impossible to identify unless you know what you’re looking for. An exotic venom might replicate a drug overdose. A personally tailored allergic reaction might trigger cardiovascular collapse.
Hold on. Where are you going?
So what happened?
We think we know how Panetti got to her.
How long has she been like this?
What if someone designed a poison to mimic the symptoms of an allergic reaction?
I can’t imagine how difficult this must be for you. And you’ve been with her the entire time she’s been comatose?
Aram, I sent you a video.
Take a look at this. Helen Dahle’s husband said he had to get away to clear his head and think about his wife’s future. Well, Robert Dahle did go to Sarasota Springs, and he did stay in the hotel he mentioned, but he did not stay alone.
I’m just saying he definitely had a motive. 
That’s what we thought, too, but the situation has taken a turn. We found surveillance footage.
There’s a prenup? 
Helen’s father, John Tadsen, was a hedge fund titan. His New York firm was worth $4.7 billion. His children and his children’s children are set for life.
They’re two weeks shy of their 10-year anniversary.
Close to $15 million.
You’ve been on the hook, what, two, three years waiting for him to leave Helen for you?
And so you made a plan. Poisoned her.
She’s in a coma. Robert hasn’t left her side. Guess he changed his mind.
So you planned it together?
You’re gonna need to tell us what you do know.
Who did he get the poison from?
Unless you wanna parade that on your perp walk, I suggest you get dressed.
And if you want even a sliver off your sentence, you’re gonna tell us who made that poison for you.
Were treating the symptoms, but not the cause.
So it’s easy to trace.
Clear.
I’m sending these files to Aram to cross-reference them with any unexplained poisoning deaths. Oh, there are dozens of victims here. Here’s Helen Dahle.
It’s gonna be okay, Mrs. Hightower.
Are you trying to tell us where your husband is? 
Aram, we need a list of all the stores that sell baby products in a 10-mile radius of the Serpentarium.
There were no medical records, nothing about Reddington on file.
Asa Hightower, FBI. Hands where I can see them.
We have your files, your wife. She’s eager to testify against you. Now put it down.
You ever trip over one of those things in the dark? They’re lethal. 
Reddington.
Asa Hightower, the Apothecary – we have him in custody and we found his lab.
The lab’s working on it. Not yet, but they will.
Okay. You’re gonna be okay, Reddington.
Reddington?
Reddington!
It’s perfect. He’ll love it. Mr. Cooper, you came.
The Apothecary gave us all the antidotes.
But last we checked, he was still in critical condition.
[ Emotional ] I don’t know.
Do you think he’ll recover?
Can we see him?
It’s the tox lab. Yes? What? I don’t under–
That can’t be right. Are you sure?
Reddington, the result–
The wine was clean. The tox lab said there was nothing in it.
They said the poison had to have been administered by something with a higher alcohol content, like gin or–
Yes. Did you drink Scotch?
Who was the other?
Reddington, talk to me. Who poisoned you?
He was abducted by Dembe last night.
Are you closer to finding him or not?
Where are we going?
And you think that’s how Dembe disappeared? He hired them?
Why couldn’t you hide them?
Where is this Sanctum Corporation?
Looks like whoever he was hiding from finally caught up with him.
Those cameras are live feeds. You can’t rewind them.
It’s a full dossier on Fickman. His movements, past addresses.
Wait a minute. He’s a murderer.
[ Dialing ] Yeah, this is Agent Elizabeth Keen. I got a case for DCPD. I’m gonna give you an address.
Thank you. [ Phone beeps ] Bureau of Prisons confirmed Dr. Sofia Gallup consults for them. She covers the entire Northeast. No home office is listed and her license is registered at a PO box.
A felon named Dennis Cauley.
To an address in Richmond. 
This looks like a dossier on Dr. Gallup’s next victim. Alex Sato.
Oops.
So the Sanctum Corporation helped him vanish. And now they want him dead. Why?
And Dr. Gallup– how is she connected?
This guy’s been tracking Nakamoto. Tracing his movements.
Looks like Nakamoto is at the Gabor Museum every afternoon. 
No sign of Cauley. Why would he pick such a crowded place?
 Baz, I’ve got eyes on him. Bald, brown leather jacket. Baz, tell me you see him. He’s getting close.
FBI!
Hands on your head. 
A therapist? Like Dr. Gallup? Gallup and Lopez could be one and the same.
Says here all the Lopez family bee farms were foreclosed by the bank, all but the one that burned down. It’s still owned by Vanessa Lopez.
But we know what you’re doing to them. Richard Fickman. Daniel Nakamoto. We know you made deals with some of your prison therapy patients.
You have no idea which client did this, so you’re killing them all.
Cooper’s sending a team to pick up Dr. Gallup. He says Aram is safe. Aram insists Dembe is innocent.
He’s not the one hurting you. He was using Aram to find that person.
We don’t know.
I don’t know.
Reddington, what’s going on? What’s happened to Dembe?
What are you talking about?
Now who is Kathryn Nemec?
Mr. Kaplan? She’s alive. [ Tears ]
Can the score be even now? Can this be over?
Dembe!
Who did this to you?
Okay, we go. You’re not going after him.
A Katai Fellowship. You do realize how prestigious that is? When’s the meeting?
Samar was nominated for a Katai Fellowship.
Well, that depends. Define “forever”?
The person who unearthed the bodies goes by the name of Mr. Kaplan. She’s Reddington’s cleaner and one of his closest confidants.
Mr. Kaplan has told the authorities about the ice rink. The bodies.
And you think Mr. Kaplan hired her to kidnap your finance guy?
He’s having a hard time, actually.
Finding out truths about who you really are is never easy.
She’s amazing.
If you’ll do something for me.
When I thought you’d killed Mr. Kaplan, I felt responsible. Not just responsible. I felt complicit.
Yes, but she did it for me. Can’t you see that if you hurt her, you’re hurting me? I will help you stop her, but I will not let you hurt her. Now I need you to look me in the eye and tell me you won’t harm her.
Then you can’t come up.
You risked your life for our family, and he shot you for it. [ Agnes fusses ] He shot you. I can never make that right, but I can protect you. I can keep you safe. But that would mean that I’d have to take you into custody.
[ Mouths words ] Where’d did you hear those words? I- I know those words.
That can’t be true.
I don’t believe you.
So you served Reddington up on a silver platter to the FBI. You did that for me.
I can protect my own daughter just fine, thank you.
She was at my apartment.
A clear shot at Reddington.
She knows that. It’s more of a wish, a hope to protect Agnes.
Let’s do it.
I wonder how long she’s been staying here.
Remember that number we found? Alexa Feist?
No, but I looked into who she is – PTA, Rotary Club.
Well, she isn’t interested in her. She’s interested in her brother. Alexa Feist’s maiden name is Gerard.
Reddington.
Marvin Gerard is Philomena’s next target. She’s trying to pull him out of hiding by using his sister. We’re headed to her place now.
How long ago?
Did you see the vehicle she was driving?
[ Calls ] Aram.
Don’t move!
Hands in the air!
On your knees. Gerard. Where’s Marvin Gerard? 
Tell me how I can find Kaplan. You’re not leaving here until I know.
I’m trying to protect her.
Look, it’s pretty simple. Either we find Kaplan first, or Reddington does. Who do you think she stands a better chance with?
Because I just found out Kate Kaplan helped me as a baby.
She finally turned. Kaplan’s headed to Vienna.
How’d you do it? How’d you change the fingerprint?
Don’t play dumb. The one Gale and Ressler found that connects you to the death of Diane Fowler.
I’ll adjust my Christmas list.
You found her.
And the man she’s with?
Science or science fiction?
I understand suppressing memories, helping someone to mute out a traumatic experience, but manipulating them?
This man, is he the one who erased my memory of that night?
Why is she meeting with him now? Is it connected to the fire? To me?
We’ve confirmed that after meeting with Kaplan, Krilov boarded a flight to New York. He landed in JFK four hours ago and told passport control he was staying at the Winthrop Grand Hotel.
Reddington doesn’t know. And he couldn’t ask because Kaplan eluded the associate who took this photo. Reddington’s on his way to Vienna to pick up the trail.
It’s a brutal process.
I’ll go with Samar.
All the more reason for me to avoid his calls.
I’m not Reddington’s informant.
We’re gonna need to take this.
I understand.
Here you go.
Walk fast.
Because any second he’s gonna realize he’s holding my rent check.
The man who raised me was a grifter. Couldn’t be pink and perfect if I tried. It’s an invoice and arrival itinerary. Manilow Van Lines.
No. But it arrived last night.
You’re not responsible for what we find.
This is what? A stash of medical equipment?
Yeah. But whose? 
That was Gale again. Third time today.
Oh, my God. That’s Dr. Selma Orchard. The unpleasant recollection you had about the last specialist who was forced to look into my memory, that’s her.
The equipment she used on me was similar to what we confiscated. Krilov needs a new lab so maybe he’s going after someone who could supply him with one.
Dr. Orchard, this is Elizabeth Keen. Listen carefully. There’s a man coming for you. His name is Bogdan Krilov.
Hello? [ Dial tone ] Dr. Orchard? 
Dr. Orchard? Selma?
It’s okay. You’re gonna be okay. It’s okay. He’s gone.
This is Agent Elizabeth Keen with the FBI. I need a medical team. Priority three.
You heard me. Selma Orchard.
To me? Now you do think this is about my memory?
The list?
Krilov was hired to adjust someone’s memory. We confiscated his lab. So he stole yours.
He stole it from me 25 years ago. That’s why we needed you to get it back.
We won’t know until we find him. Do you have any idea where he went?
Were you able to get a list of names Julian Gale ID’d?
There. Where is that?
Who is here?!
I know who you are. The memories you took from me when I was a girl and trust me, we’re gonna talk about that, but first, your patient– where is he?
[ Whispers ] Ressler.
Where’s Agent Ressler?
I’m not gonna ask again.
I told him I’m not gonna ask again.
You know, unfortunately, I don’t know much about Propofol. [ Bottle clatters ] I think it’s a general anesthetic? Can you even inject this directly into the arm?
I don’t know. You tell me. You’re the doctor, Princess.
Would mainlining this cause long-term damage to the heart?
The lungs, the kidneys – would it kill an old man?
Keep talking.
Aram, I have texted you an address. Laurel Hitchin’s house on the river. We’re on our way now.
We have him in custody. His target? Kaplan’s target was Ressler.
We think Krilov somehow programmed Ressler to believe Hitchin abducted a witness that could connect her to Reven Wright’s murder.
Kaplan gave us the chance to abandon our relationship with Reddington, and we didn’t. Now she’ll take every step necessary to dismantle the task force, starting with Ressler.
Stay with him.
Ressler! Stand down.
There is no witness.
You’re not ill. Your memory was manipulated by Dr. Bogdan Krilov. We have him in custody.
No, you need to trust me. The Detective who reached out to you?
There is no Elijah Bell in the Philly PD. He works with Krilov. So does your witness.
By Krilov’s men. He staged the whole thing. Hitchin wasn’t involved. During the raid, you were knocked out, unconscious. That’s when Krilov started to work on you, implanting memories. Hitchin coming to pick you up.
Krilov made it up. Krilov staged the whole thing.
You’re right. We will find justice for Reven. Just not this way. Ressler, look at your hand.
You were drugged. Propofol, Tramadol. It’s not your fault. You’re the victim here.
Yes. And you’re a murderer. And one day, we’re gonna prove it.
What are you doing?
I didn’t do it for you. I did it for him.
Donald Ressler represents what’s best about this country. He’s loyal and honest, and he believes that no one – no one – is above the law. And I believe that one day, you’ll be the one being dragged off in handcuffs. And he’ll be walking into his lake house to watch the sunset.
I want every detail – what you did, how you did it, what memories you implanted in Agent Ressler’s consciousness, and what you took away. You’re going to give me everything we need to exonerate him.
From 25 years ago? No. But then, you wouldn’t be very good at your job if I did.
What are you talking about?
What memories?
You’re lying.
That’s not gonna happen.
Two years ago? Two, not 25. Two.
What was the secret you needed Krilov to take away?
You did it once.
[ Cellphone vibrates ] That’s Julian Gale. I’ve been avoiding his calls, and I’m beginning to think that was a mistake.
Against you.
You must be Agent Gale.
I was a fugitive. It was awful.
Should it?
I-I don’t know anything about that.
Never have.
Is there a question here?
Why did you wanna see me?
Exact revenge on me? For what?
But who hired him? Mr. Kaplan?
Where are you?
Are you sure?
The Debt Collector is an avenging angel who’s hired to exact poetic revenge. His terms are simple – whatever the perceived crime, he exacts an equal measure of punishment.
Just a 15-year-old murder story about a Senator’s daughter who bought cocaine laced with ketamine. Ultimately, she passed out on the beach and drowned when the tide came in.
Against the kid who sold her the drugs, Tyler Obermeir. Story has it, the Senator wanted him to die exactly like his daughter did.
I already tried. He died last year.
Tyler’s body was never found.
Yeah. So?
Alert local authorities.
 What do we got?
The body hasn’t decomposed.
After all this time, you think toxicology could give us anything on the killer?
We found Tyler Obermeir, but even if toxicology can tell us something about the killer, this Debt Collector, it’s gonna take some time.
Medical examiner said two weeks.
I know you have good intentions, but you’ve got to stop. I don’t need your help.
I don’t need your protection.
No, do you?
This coffin has a false bottom. That body never left the drop point.
Did you pull a print or find blood?
Let me guess, the driver was a janitor from Horizon Middle School named Edgar Grant.
I want to be in the field.
Under control. Red’s people took Agnes and everything I need to the safe house. I’m headed there now. I just have to pack a bag. What’s going on?
Take photos. I wanna see everything. Hey, let me call you back when I get to the safe house. Bye.
Aah! 
Listen to me, Edgar. That’s your name, isn’t it? Edgar Grant?
The FBI raided your house this morning. So if you hurt me, you’ll only make it worse for yourself and your family when you’re arrested. Why are you doing this? You don’t know me.
Who?
Tyson Pryor’s in prison. Why would you want to help him?
So that’s my fault? He wants to kill me ’cause he had a rough go inside?
Let me guess, you killed him.
So you see yourself as a crusader?
[ Grunting ] Ha! Ah.
This is all about getting to Kaplan.
Two graves? Is the other one for you or for Kaplan?
You lied. You said you were trapped in steerage on a ship.
You had me kidnapped. You put Agnes at risk.
Untie me. I said untie me.
She’s on her way here now thinking she’s going to save me.
And you’re gonna kill her.
After everything that’s happened? What could she possibly say to convince you?
Reddington, don’t do this.
Reddington, there has to be another way. Please don’t do this.
[ Cries out ] Kaplan! No! It’s a trap!
[ Steps forward ] What he did is indefensible. But it’s done and it can’t be changed. What matters is now, the truth today, and that is Reddington has given me his word that he can coexist with you. Will you give me your word that you can coexist with him?
There are snipers in the trees! I count at least two!
Is dead. Reddington hired him to lure her out.
I don’t know what to say.
Stop! Don’t shoot! 
Stand down! Stand down! 
Nothing yet. A search party is still on site.
I couldn’t stop her.
We ran the ballistics. Kaplan’s men didn’t take that shot.
A new actor. How is that even possible? Nobody even knew you were at that cabin.
I know Mr. Kaplan said that the two of you can’t coexist, that that was her truth, but I still hope it can change.
I agree with Ressler, and with Aram. I’m proud and I’m ashamed. And one day, when they teach a course on Reddington’s task force at Quantico, we can do a panel and debate the pros and cons. But right now, we need to get Kate Kaplan.
The closer Gale gets, the faster we need to remove Kaplan as a threat to Reddington.
Because we need Reddington to deal with Gale.
Of course not. I’m not suggesting anything other than what we already know to be true, which is that if we want to get out from Gale’s shadow, we’re gonna need Reddington’s help.
Her real name is Kathryn Nemec. She’s a trained mortician turned crime scene cleaner, and one of Reddington’s oldest and most trusted confidantes.
Kaplan spent 30 years tending to his messes while Reddington built his criminal empire, and it took her five months to surgically dismantle it. We believe she hired Natalie Luca to go after Reddington’s money launderer, Zack Smoll; Isabella Stone to murder Stratos Sarantos, cutting off Reddington’s Mediterranean shipping operations; Dr Bogdan Krilov to sideline Ressler; the Apothecary to poison Reddington. She put 86 skeletons in the hands of Julian Gale, shutting Reddington out of Europe completely and putting us at risk.
One. Mario Dixon.
According to the NCIC database, Mario Brandon Dixon is a thief who specializes in high value targets– jewels, art, cars, nuts–
He has a kid brother in prison. Mecklenburg Correctional.
I told you, we’re gonna need him–
Which is indefensible.
He did, and if he’s in trouble, then so are we. I’m convinced we either rise together or fall apart.
No, we’re here for you, Dino, what you threw away for him. You graduated high school with a 3.8 GPA and a soccer scholarship to Clemson.
It’s been a rough haul, hasn’t it? If you’re not in the SHU, you’re in the infirmary.
If the information you provide leads us to your brother, we’re authorized to slice five years off your sentence.
Mario Dixon works out of some high-end hipster boutique in Hampden. We’re working on a warrant now.
There. The guy with the shoulder bag.
FBI! Hands where I can see them!
We’re in pursuit. Suspect’s on a motorcycle, headed west on 6th, near Independence.
Aram, he went underground. Some kind of tunnel. Do you have eyes?
Could you narrow that down a little?
Has anyone opened it yet?
Thank you.
It’s Reddington’s signed immunity deal with the Department of Justice.
You shot three federal officers. You stole a classified document from a government facility you shouldn’t have even known existed.
Is that right?
I wouldn’t celebrate. We’re not charging you, but we’re not exactly letting you go either.
I’ll leave you two to talk.
You got Dixon to talk. How? You know what? Don’t tell me. I honestly don’t wanna know.
But he told you how to find Kaplan?
5:00 doesn’t give us much time.
Wait. What about Dixon? Our people should wire him up.
Go where? Reddington, there’s something wrong. I can hear it in your voice. Where are you going?
I’ll call him.
What’s goin’ on? You’re supposed to be here with Dixon. Our meeting with Kaplan’s in less than an hour.
[ Lowered voice ] You lied about the location. You’re gonna kill her.
[ Whispers ] I asked you not to do this.
That was Dembe. He said he can’t find Reddington.
But how did they know to do that? Gale only knew about us, not Aram.
And that’s indefensible, but he says he wants to protect us, and I believe him.
Where are you going?
Cooper tried to shut it down.
Who’s Henry Prescott?
Weren’t you squatting in a Congressman’s apartment?
Why? How can a fixer for hire derail a grand jury?
Prescott – Do you have any leads?
The football player?
Reddington, I think we found a way for you to get to Prescott.
You wanted to see me?
You worked together.
So that’s why he surrendered to you.
I’m sorry, um, why are you telling me this?
Procured a sample of Reddington’s blood? From evidence? That’s tampering.
Mr. Kaplan. Please don’t do this.
Let’s meet. [ Sighs ] Just you and me.
Yeah. But I have every reason to trust you.
Mr. Kaplan? Hello?
Are you okay?
What are you talking about?
You don’t have to keep me safe. This could be over. It could stop.
What truth?
You’re scaring me.
Kate, where are we going?
This secret what Reddington’s hiding from me I think I know–
Baz? My God.
[ On phone ] I need an ambulance! Highway 501! 
Yeah, I’m fine. We gotta get out there.
No, we can’t wait. We gotta help her. Reddington’s gonna kill her.
[ Running ] No!
Yeah.
I ran his DNA two weeks after we met.
We were undercover in Montreal having dinner, and he said that everything I thought I knew about myself was a lie. It was intimate and weird. And when we thought we were made, he snuck out the back and I palmed his scotch glass. But when the envelope came back, I was scared it would confirm the devil was my father. I didn’t look at it. Threw it away.
Mr. Kaplan was my nanny.
And now she’s gone. Just like Sam. And my mom. Everyone who knew me best, knew the answers about who I was, where I came from.
You lied to me.
The day we met, you asked how I got my scar. And I told you my father gave it to me.
What was it you said? A father who’s a career criminal and a mother who died of weakness and shame.
Why didn’t you just tell me who you were? Why keep it a secret? Come into my life, give up everything, go broke trying to protect me, and not tell me you’re my father? 
What was so awful that you withheld the answer to a question I’ve been wondering my entire life? 
Were you afraid I’d turn out like you? ‘Cause guess what? I am like you. All those times you asked me to think like a criminal, was it a test to see how naturally it came to me? 
Because it did come naturally. And that terrifies me.
Walk away? Are you serious? How can you be so smart and so clueless? Yes, I’m terrified. I’m angry. I’m angry at you, at who I am, at the fact that I want to help you despite everything you’ve done to me and to yourself. But anger and fear and a certain amount of hatred are all normal in a family. And that’s what we are. And I’m not gonna walk away from that.
Oh. I’m good. Where are you? I thought we were meeting up.
Are those sirens?
Wait. Reddington, are you okay?
Reddington?
You’re living here.
At the Terrace Vista Motor Lodge?
I thought you’d be a little bit more proactive, trying to find ways to rebuild, crawl your way back to the top. Where’s Dembe?
[ Chuckles ] I’m glad you’re having a nice time. But Cooper actually sent me to see if you might have a case.
Well, you are my father and– Oh, my God, that sentence and all that it means. But, to be honest, knowing who my father is at this point isn’t gonna change who I am or the fact that you’re my CI. And I need a case.
Are you asking for a job?
This isn’t happening.
The movie company?
Um, could you excuse us for just one moment?
I’m sorry. What are you doing? We need a Blacklister.
We need a name.
“We”?
[ Scoffs ] [ Footsteps depart ]
[ On phone ] Yes, sir, I told him the situation. [ Sighs ] No, he doesn’t seem to care.
It’s Cooper. He’s been happier.
Cant?
Who’s TL?
Putnum smokes Hartswicks. We saw a picture of him at Russell Springs. This one’s still warm.
Maybe you should’ve thought of that before you stole the money.
His “work”? Running the bumper cars?
We’re not turning around.
I sincerely doubt you have–
You’re not seriously considering–
No, no deal!
I think we might be stopping a little earlier than you’d like.
They’re US Marshals. If I don’t stop–
Let me handle it.
Just let me get rid of ’em.
Reddington!
[ To Smokey ] I got a lot of questions! But first, who the hell were those guys? 
[ Coughs ] This car’s shot. I’ll call Cooper.
What? Why not?
Are you kidding me? I’m an FBI agent. He’s in my custody. I’ll make sure you get your money.
[ To Red, whispering ] Mind telling me what’s going on?
Knock it off. Rent money and an adventure? What are you up to?
You can pretend to be loving this all you want, but I know the truth. The truth is you’re scared. Scared because you’ve lost everything and you don’t know how to get it back.
Oh, stop it.
Stop it!
Again? How long?
To steal? No. No, you’re not.
Don’t speak to me like I’m a child.
Drink your coffee.
I’m not helping him. I’m bringing a fugitive to justice.
I’m just doing this by the book.
No.
Okay. I’ll hold it for you.
Hey! FBI!
They got him! He’s gone! Putnum’s gone!
[ On cellphone ] The truck had Texas plates.
He has a “warrior rune” tattoo. That could indicate he did some time – in federal prison.
Wait, this is the guy.
Reach out to FBI headquarters. Have them run their contacts and sources and see if they can’t get a location on this scumbag.
LeMarc had to have his people listening in on us. To the bondsman, maybe? It’s the only way they could have found us. And as for Putnum, if he’s not dead yet, he will be soon.
Go where? What about Putnum?
What? No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, you’re not.
I said no.
Don’t touch that money!
You walk out that door, I fire.
[ Frustrated ] Uhh!
No.
Yes, it’s the right thing to do.
I never should’ve let LeMarc go.
LeMarc’s the real bad guy in this. If we had him, Putnum could agree to testify against LeMarc, get leniency, stand a chance. I’m not defending what he did, but he’s only in this situation because–
He just wanted to get away from the criminal in his life. Can’t blame him for that.
FBI! FBI! Federal agent!
There’s no threat. This genius here called in a 10-89 as a diversion – to avoid a court hearing.
I need you to escort him. He’s got an appointment with a judge in 40 minutes.
I know it sounds crazy he would do something like this to make ends meet, but Putnum is now in the US Marshals’ custody, and he is at trial as we speak. He did it for the money.
Sir?
It’s the right thing to do. I want to do the right thing.
Got your bail money?
There’s something you should know. You may be my father, and I am going to help you rebuild your empire, because it will enable us to catch criminals. But I’m not gonna lose sight of who I am in the process.
And a neo-Nazi is walking free, and his cartel is thriving. And as for Putnum, the only way he could get leniency is if he returned the money he embezzled, but thanks to us, he can’t do that. And his former partner, Hawkins, is being transported from jail to the courthouse and is going to testify against Putnum, and he will be found guilty, and he will go to prison. And there is no guarantee LeMarc won’t have him killed.
That’s what this whole thing was about? You had to get Putnum back in order to draw Hawkins out, which could only happen if Putnum showed up to trial. This whole thing was about getting to the accountant.
I was wrong. You’re not at all scared of the future.
You’re actually loving this.
That was Cooper. He’s got a beat on LeMarc and his crew, and they should be in custody within the hour.
Dembe. Where have you been? Do you want a drink?
[ Gasps ] You’re back! [ Laughs ] Oh!
How you doing? Are you really here?
You’ve got news? I’ve got news. It’s about Reddington.
He’s my father.
I know, it’s crazy. Uh, but it explains so much. I mean, of course, I’m confused about why he took so long to tell me and how I feel about everything, but–
Wait a minute. You’re here. [ Laughs ] So, do you have something to tell me?
[ Smiling happily ] You better not leave. I’ll kill you.
I can’t believe you’re back. I have so many questions for you, like where you’ve been.
But it’s done? You’re back?
Oh. [ SQUEALS ] So sorry. Oh, I’m out of practice.
Oh, my God!
[ SIGHS ] Oh, it happens fast.
To have sex?
Yeah. Great. [ CHUCKLES ] First, let’s have sex.
Mm.
I’m so sorry I’m late. Um, last night was crazy.
Well, I don’t wanna make excuses for Reddington, but–
–if his contacts are compromised like he says they are
Where are you going?
Greyson Blaise? Isn’t he the one who circumnavigated the globe in a hot-air balloon?
He’s an art thief.
Blaise isn’t gonna align with you if he knows you’re broke.
Which means high security.
What about Reddington? With all that security, it’ll be too risky to bring him in the front.
Nice work.
Just try to keep a low profile. The last thing we need is someone to recognize you.
Sinatra? I can’t imagine.
[ Whispers To Red ] I don’t see him. Do you?
Did you hear me? He isn’t here.
What are you doing?
Are you insane?
You don’t have any money.
Knock it off.
Colleen Williams.
Wow. Those are just exquisite. Uh, may I?
I thought you were broke. I didn’t know you had a house – on Lake Como.
Then why did you tell him you’re throwing a party there?
And say what?
How do you know that?
It’s amazing. How’d you convince the owner to let you use it?
Maybe you could just rent a different house.
Thank you, you look– What is that?
What color is that, pumpkin? It looks like a pumpkin.
Ah.
On his way, which is more than I can say for Blaise. According to the tracker I put on his girlfriend, they’re still at their house.
What do you mean, you intended for the tracking device to be found?
Anna Cartwright is not a spy.
But she’s innocent of this, and by framing her, she could be killed.
Okay. The good news is Ressler is en route and the painting will be here in 20 minutes.
Blaise just walked in.
Finally!
Leaving so soon?
Oh, but you haven’t seen the painting yet.
I can’t believe it worked.
By partnering with Blaise, by getting him to vouch for your financial situation.
Where are you going?
Are you telling me that this entire thing– The forgery, the mansion, the 150 bottles of wine and Blaise’s arrest– Were all an extremely expensive and elaborate ruse so that you could rob him?
[ Enthusiastically ] Cool!
Maybe the wine or the fact that I have no legal jurisdiction in Italy or that Blaise called me “sugar” earlier, but yeah I think it’s really cool.
Egidio says the police are on their way 15 minutes, maybe less.
[ To a man ] Take these.
[ Whispers, To Red: ] Before we get killed, you mind telling me what we’re looking for?
Six minutes and counting.
The Picasso?
[ GASPS ] [ It’s the Napoleon necklace ]
What?
Uh– The Lincoln Penny? That’s what we’re here to steal, a coin?
[ CHUCKLES ] Is that really a Picasso in the back seat?
Why’d you do it?
I’m scared of you. Now more than ever. Of who you are, because you might be who I am, too. I let you do it because it felt like the right thing to do. It wasn’t. But it certainly felt that way because–
In more ways than I care to admit.
Wow, smells amazing!
“Us all”? What’s going on?
Hello! What’s going on?
What exactly are we celebrating?
Dembe told me you moved out of your hotel?
So, what, you’re apartment hunting?
[ Reading ] Says here the victim shot first.
McGinnis a paid-for killer. But according to this article, he has a clean record.
Killer cops for hire? Who’s hiring them?
Andrew McGinnis. He’s a rookie officer without a blemish on his record. The victim was Scott Stansbury who spent 20 years bouncing between prison cells, parole hearings, and rehab.
IA could spend months filing those reports. More people could die by then.
You kicked the door down even though you got no response?
And that’s where you saw him?
Which shot hit him?
He was hit once. You said you fired twice. I assume you remember which missed and which didn’t.
He’s dirty.
Said he shot twice and the second shot hit him.
Like I said – he’s dirty.
If that’s what our investigation determines that officer may well go to prison.
What was?
Structured settlement?
They offered a lump sum.
Waterday – tell me more about them.
[ Whispers ] Hey. What’s going on?
And he needs you to dig himself out?
[ Sighs ] Okay, go. I got this.
Waterday Financial buys a ton of these structured settlements, mostly from people like Scott Stansbury.
The same cop who shot Scott Stansbury.
And so this was bound to happen. Is that what you’re saying, Mr. Johnson?
We’re gonna need to see the documents pertaining to your structured settlements and the loans you made to the members of the Baltimore Police Department.
We can get one if you insist.
The AUSA agreed we don’t have enough to get a warrant.
And they lost money on the deal plus, we only have one example, but, granted, that seems like one more than anyone would need.
We don’t know why, but Waterday appears to be financing assassinations.
FBI. Step away from your desk.
Insurance records? Waterday’s in the insurance business, too?
Let me guess they had policies on the other victims, too.
And the next target you said you might know who that is.
Do you have a vehicle description?
FBI! Drop your weapon! Put the gun down. I’m not gonna warn you again.
Nice ride.
Okay. Why are you driving it?
Why not – one crooked cop to the next? Maybe you can bond over the body in your trunk.
Hurry up before it gets ripe! 
It’s her. SWAT Commander, target is on site. We move on my go.
I know he can be terrible sometimes, but come on – elephants?
That sounds at least amusing.
Nutjob or not, he is my father. And I I appreciate you offering to help him. Means the world to me. Thanks. [ Cellphone ringing ] Okay. They need me. Um – I’ll see you in a bit.
Yeah. There’s a burger place in Adams Morgan I’ve been wanting to try.
I believe the word you’re looking for is “amazing.”
Oh! Yeah. If either of us had even remotely normal parents.
Someone’s really trying to get ahold of you.
They’re not supposed to be calling us.
[ Loudly, so the caller will hear ] Hey, we’re on the no-call list. What you’re doing is illegal.
At lunch no calls, no interruptions.
Yeah.
Reddington? 
Nice upgrade from the no-tell motel. Can you afford it?
Uh, me and a billion other people.
[ Reads aloud ] “Champion racehorse and trainer die in stable fire.”
It doesn’t say anything here about murder or arson.
But even he couldn’t spell out why a horse killer is on the Blacklist.
» Baghdad, 2015. An RPG took down a private plane carrying one of the only two known statues of the Sumerian goddess Inanna. Four crew members were killed in the crash, leaving the only other statue in private hands.
Reddington believes her next target is on U.S. soil.
The princess is the sole heir to the throne. If she dies, the royal family dies with her.
According to the State Department, King Jovan and his daughter instituted reforms that were unpopular with the country’s hard-liners.
Go. I’ll keep an eye on surveillance. I’m gonna need access to your security feeds.
Wait. Go back. That stairwell.
We lost the feeds! We need to get her out of there right now!
[ On phone ] 8:00 would be great. Uh-huh. Oh, I’m sorry – last name Keen. Thank you.
Cascabel.
I know. We’re going for dinner tonight.
No. I’m sorry. I got a call in the parking lot. It was Aram. He said we had a break in the case.
Ugh! Look at those chickens and the burgers and the fries! [ Sighs ]
[ Tastes Tom’s soda pop ] Mmm. Root beer. Come on. I should just be able to have lunch with my husband like a normal person.
You said you loved normal.
Okay.
Hey – deviant.
Because Ethan Isaacs wasn’t always Ethan Isaacs.
Right after Ethan got sick.
Instead, his mother kidnapped him.
We’ve been looking at this all wrong. She’s not kidnapping them to create an endling, she’s doing it so that they’ll have enough golden blood to perform the procedure.
The endling’s name is Nirah Ahmad. She has a sick child who needs a heart transplant. My gut tells me that every attack she’s responsible for has been to finance this procedure. And I know for a fact that people will die if we don’t find out where that surgery is taking place.
Nothing. We have a photo, that’s it.
And we don’t know black-market medicine. You do.
Do you know where to find him?
Where are we? What is this place?
Fascinating story, but we’re kind of in a hurry.
Cynthia Rutherford. I’ve hired Mr. Reddington to find someone.
Where?
Step away from the tables! Hands! Everyone, hands where I can see them!
I know you’re trying to save your son, but I can’t let you hurt these people in order to do it.
You’re gonna have to let us take him home.
The hospital, then.
[ Whispers ] What are you talking about?
Three patients for emergency evac.
She and her son escaped before I got here.
We’re sorry for pulling you into this.
Okay, no. I’m not. If it means saving Ethan’s life.
What’s the end game? 
Nirah sacrifices herself to save her son, and then what? There has to be an ulterior motive – otherwise, why bother?
Now what do you believe?
Are we still talking about Nirah?
How is he?
Thank God.
Nik – you don’t mean that.
He’s my father.
Yes.
She shot herself.
If I hadn’t, Ethan would be dead.
A criminal died to save the life of a child. I’m okay with that.
Yes, and I agreed with him.
I’m not influenced by him.
You have no reason to be concerned.
I am the worst. I can’t believe I missed lunch and dinner.
Yeah. It was complicated.
I’m terrified to admit it. I don’t want to admit it. But it’s true.
Reddington and I got Nik involved in something he never should’ve been a part of.
I know he can, but ultimately, it’s my responsibility. Nik would’ve never been involved with Reddington if it weren’t for me. 
Tell me everything.
Nik’s d-dead.
[ VOICE BREAKING ] He was strangled. They found his body in an empty lot miles away from home or any hospital.
The last thing he said to me was he never wanted to see me again.
No, but we do.
He had him perform a surgery, and then Nik said he was out. Reddington probably thought he was a liability – that he knew too much.
Nik was good. He was decent. The only indecent thing in his life was Reddington and me.
Could you excuse us, please?
[ WHISPERS ] Nik Korpal was murdered.
I want to believe you.
I want a name.
The chemical-plant explosion in Leeds? Ilyas Surkov claimed credit for that. What’s the riddle?
And how do you know he didn’t commit it?
According to Reddington, 15 months.
No, he was like a ghost. One month, he claimed credit for a subway bombing in Lisbon, and the next, the kidnapping of three journalists in Crimea. If he did die, no one would know.
He knows the best off-market doctors on every continent. One of them treated Surkov for end-stage pancreatic cancer.
Or people acting in his name.
Did you ask your task force about our copycat theory?
You found traces of that taggant.
[ On phone ] We know the explosives used by Surkov in his last three attacks came from Lignes D’Avenir.
MI6 had Ghaffari under surveillance. It didn’t yield any actionable intel, but Ghaffari proves to be quite the creature of habit.
Ghaffari is a Moroccan immigrant. He speaks French and Arabic. Surveillance logs gave us what we believe is Ghaffari’s code name for Surkov. Samar can use that to establish her credibility.
Who the hell is that?
Gun!
Drop your weapon!
Who the hell are you?
Why no deconfliction protocol?
I can’t answer that. All I can tell you is we’re…
I don’t care who gets him to talk. As long as you can get him to tell us what he knows, we’re happy to sit this one out.
There are other ways to get people to talk.
How long have you been searching for him?
And the family?
Anything?
Okay. You’ve tried your way. We’re gonna try ours. Samar?
Okay, he’s ready to talk.
Him, not you or Duke White or Omar Kabinov. They gave us your file. We’ve confirmed you resigned from the Agency in 2015.
There’s nothing about that or the ghost squad whose designation is so conveniently top secret that you never had direct contact with anyone at the Agency.
No one at the Director’s Office has ever heard of your task force.
Do you know how I got Ghaffari to talk so quickly? I told him Surkov was dead. No proof, just the word of my source. The minute I told him, he knew it was true.
He’s a terrorist.
If you don’t tell us where to find him, he’s gonna commit an act of terror on US soil.
100%.
[ On phone ] The safe house has been scrubbed.
Just an empty file stamped “Cyclone.” That’s it. You sure that name means nothing to you?
Well, he’s in the wind with a lethal weapon we can’t find and a target that could be anywhere.
We know the weapon was designed to pierce Kevlar, plus the “Cyclone” files. It could be a code name, a mission, a person–
Where they happen? Coastal cities? Law enforcement in those areas that wear Kevlar?
It’s a target. Not law enforcement, but military. A target hard enough to design a weapon to penetrate it. Not steel, but Kevlar.
I need to call you back.
Aram, I need you to run a search. Any ships in the Navy, the Coast Guard – whoever the Pentagon has build ships with the name “Cyclone” that are made of a composite material similar to Kevlar.
Tell me about them.
Where is that?
Virginia.
Stand down, Osterman.
We know about you, Osterman. We know about Surkov, your team. It’s over.
I said stand down.
Cox?
Step away from your weapon.
Why would he blow up a chemical plant and an American ship?
Even if you’re telling the truth, you’re asking me to let you shoot a CIA agent who’s following orders. I can’t let you do that.
[ Over comms ] I have Osterman in custody. Human Resources, third floor. We’re gonna need a medic. Alert NCIS of a potential suspect an officer in uniform, brown hair, medium build, carrying a black backpack. [ To Osterman/Reuther: ] Looks like you were wrong.
You’re here.
I’m surprised to see you here.
I’ve been better. About how he died–
Did you find anything out?
[ SIGHS ] 
He appreciates what Nik’s done for him. And he knows Nik may have been killed because of it.
He’s willing to look into who did it.
Not yet, but it sounds like he has a lead.
[ VOICE BREAKING ] We’ve lost so many friends.
I don’t know if I can lose any more without just crawling into a fetal position or becoming a stark, raving vigilante.
[ EXHALES ] I think Meera is buried here.
I’d like to pay my respects.
I’d like to go alone, if you don’t mind.
Ooh, can I play?
Oh, there’s a hole under the lighthouse.
Ah.
And here I thought all old, rich, white men were good at golf.
I’m sorry – Mitchell who?
A travel agency?
 So if this Dunning guy is right and they are after him–
The Travel Agency was a consortium of anonymous killers responsible for a variety of unsolved murders – the assassination of a civil-rights activist in 1983, the poisoning of an anti-Glasnost Soviet businessman in ’87.
Are you going somewhere?
It’s Wednesday.
I’m sorry to be asking you these questions now, but if we’re gonna find whoever did this, we need to know everything you know.
Do you know this man, Mrs. Dunning?
Were you and your father close?
 Did he ever come to visit you?
I’m sorry – the Agency?
And orchestrated hits. Check this out.
The civil-rights activist. The Soviet businessman.
It’s Mitchell Dunning.
That means the people in the Travel Agency aren’t killing people – they’re being killed.
But the dossiers we found account for dozens of unsolved murders. They must’ve had help.
All of whom are dead.
Why is that?
Mr Dawson?
I’m sorry – where is Mr. Dawson? We were told he lived here.
And what does that mean?
What about when he sees a new car or a flat-screen TV?
Samar? 
Dunning. Knobbs. Wright. All of them.
The wife – he lied to her. Led her to believe he worked at an actual travel agency, had a normal life. She had no idea.
After the accident, somehow, somewhere, there was a slip-up, and she picked up on it.
She stumbled onto his finances.
A congressman from Utah murdered while he was in Salt Lake. A South African police general gunned down while he was in Cape Town.
There’s no closure in confronting a man who doesn’t even know what day it is, so she just kept digging.
Finally, she figured out his protocols
And she used those same protocols to run her husband. Took advantage of his amnesia, making him believe it was still 1989, using him as her own contract killer to take out those in the Travel Agency. All the while, he had no idea.
His wife probably used it to signal Dawson.
Aram, we need you to get a trace on that burner.
Eleanor Dawson! FBI! I need you to put that gun down!
Yes. If you put your gun down, we can talk about it. I want to talk about it.
My name is Elizabeth. I’m a mother, like you. I want to understand.
Yes.
Will you?
I know it’s super spur-of-the-moment, and this is not very romantic. I mean, we’re under fluorescent lights. These pens are attached to the table, for God’s sake, but– Look. With everything I see in a day, I just feel so lucky to have you. And if we don’t do this now–
Ohh.
I have to meet Reddington in 30 minutes.
Um, technically–
– you are my first husband because our first marriage was annulled–
–and last night was our first time–
–sleeping together as husband and wife.
Well, actually, like, the third time– Well, first night.
And morning.
That’s your phone.
“No Caller ID”? That’s very mysterious.
Hey, you could’ve won a set of steak knives or the lottery.
Aww.
And I have steak knives.
It’s fine. Don’t need to answer.
I’m better than okay. I’m great. We’re great – Tom and I. We got married. See? [ Shows diamond ] Now’s normally when people say “congratulations.”
Thank you.  You know, um– for the first time in a very long time, I feel– I don’t know– [ INHALES DEEPLY ] Happy. [ CHUCKLES ]
Then I see what’s going on in the world.
Human trafficking.
Like you? You’re in the human-smuggling business?
Why are you telling me this?
In his mind, he was giving people hope.
Whatever you believe about the business, bottom line, people are dying, and that needs to stop.
Which is why he needs our help.
He’s onto something. He’s checking for a wire.
We got to move.
The Irish – The coyote Dembe met with mentioned something about the Irish. Do you know who he’s talking about?
So local authorities won’t cooperate on warrants or subpoenas.
Looks like we’ve hit our first way-station. Armed guards and gates. You guys seeing this?
I don’t have him.
[ On phone ] Dembe is gone.
We believe his truck left the premises before we got to the building.
We set a perimeter, but it’s not that simple. They used tunnels to get into Macedonia.
Yeah. I know. We’re working on it.
Cooper?
Reddington?
As of now, there are still seven trucks unaccounted for. The police are looking for them, but the drivers were instructed to abandon them in hard-to-find places.
This just came in from Reddington. Those are the drivers who received the burn signal.
He got to Kilgannon, got the payroll records. We have their legal names and addresses and the routes they were assigned.
How much time do we have left?
Reddington is going after Dembe’s driver.
You don’t know that. All of his stuff his clothes, prescription bottles – It’s all still there, right?
He can’t run with nothing. He has to come back.
You saved him. He owes you his life. He protects you because you protected him.
The ambulances are on their way.
So that they could be arrested and deported like the others at the warehouse. What about them?
[ On phone ] I’m sure you’re fine and I’m overreacting. And you just can’t answer your phone, because for some reason that we’ll both be laughing about this time tomorrow, but something is wrong. And something–
Tom. He’s missing.
Me again. And again and again.
I’m sorry to put you guys through this. I’m sure I’m overreacting.
I thought I did. I don’t know.
Reddington, anything?
You said you had a lead.
But you think the two are related?
I know. I’m trying to convince myself everything’s fine, but I’m doing a terrible job.
But who would be holding him and why? Did he take a job he didn’t tell me about?
Well, call me if you find anything out.
Towed from where? 
[ Shows Tom’s photo ] We have reason to believe this man was here last night. Have you seen him?
His car was impounded outside Room 11.
Room 11. Can we get the key?
You know what? Forget the key.
His car was parked outside!
In front of this room!
[ Dialing ] I’ve called Tom so many times, his mailbox is full. It’s pointless. But hearing his voice is the only thing that calms me down.
How do you know that?
Have you identified either suspect?
And her accomplice?
Okay. And the other camera? There. Stop the tape. Can you zoom in on that car? What is that, a hotel key?
That must be Steve Smith.
Well, we have her name and the VIN number on his car, so let’s circulate both, put a BOLO out, and we’ll find them. And when we find them, we find Tom.
Wanted why?
That’s was Tom was up to. He was trying to find out who killed Nik.
And the others?
Text me when you get an address. Call me when you know more. Ressler, let’s go.
Where is he?
But whoever he’s mixed up is capable of this– [ CRYING ]
[ CRYING ] I can’t.
Ressler, I can’t.
[ SOBS ] 
Keen.
Oh, my God, Tom. I’ve been worried sick about you. Please tell me you’re okay?
What’s going on? Where are you?
Tom, what’s wrong?
What are you talking about? I#8217;ve got half the FBI looking for you.
Tom, tell me what’s going on.
Tom, you’re scaring me.
Tom! Oh, my God! ­I have no idea what’s going– [ GASPS ]
No! No! [ GRUNTS ]
No, please! What do you want? Please!
No! No!
No!!
No!!
[ WEAKLY ] Tom?
Promise me.
Promise [ STAMMERS ] tell Agnes about me.
[ WHIMPERS ] [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] [ SOBBING ]
[ To dog ] Hi. Hi. I know, I know.
Still have an L14-20 male plug? I saw one here last week.
Oh, Early, if anything worked up at that place, I’d get bored.
Yeah, they say ice.
It’s on my to-do list.
[ Leaving ] Stay warm.
[ Exhales deeply ] It feels like glass under my skin. [ Inhales sharply, groans, sighs ] I can’t.
I just want out of the chair. [ Liz is in a wheelchair ]
[ Sighing ] Okay. [ Grunts ] [ Groans ]
That’s sweet. You didn’t have to drive out here in this weather.
Oh, I’m sorry, Colin. Come on in.
You headed to the station?
I’ll send you with some coffee.
That sounds nice. Maybe when the weather passes.
Oh, pbht. I’m sure I’ll get around to it sooner or later.
I’ll let you know. Be careful out there.
Hey, you.
[ Crying softly, she sits on the ground ] [ Voice breaking ] I’m not doing very well. I told myself I wasn’t gonna tell you that. [ Sniffles ] That’s the last thing you need to hear, right? [ Sniffles ]
[ Gasps ]
Broadcasting in the blind. Hello?
Can anyone read me? Is anyone hearing this? Hello?
Oh, come on.
[ Sighs ]
Colin?
I need you to promise me something.
The Blacklist. I need you to promise me you’ll keep working on it with the Task Force.
It has to.
What you’ve done – [ Sighs ] What you’ve made it possible for the Task Force to do– You know, I’ve never thanked you for that. Why you do it, what you get out of it at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. But I need you to promise me you’re gonna keep doing it.
Thank you. I have one more favor to ask you. And it’s not gonna be easy for you, but it’s important to me.
I don’t want you to follow me. You’re gonna let go. Can you do that?
What the hell is going on here?
Who the hell are you people? 
You said your plane went down?
And you went down where?
I didn’t hear anything.
And you were all able to just walk away?
Is he the guy in the other room?
He was out when I found him.
Actually, he found me.
Not if we don’t get him to a hospital. I closed up his wounds, but he’s bleeding internally. You can tell by his breathing. There’s blood in his airways. He’s got a few hours, maybe.
Good luck out there. It’s an ice rink. Block’s frozen on my truck. Even if I had a phone, the lines are down. Look, bottom line is, we got to get your friend out of here fast, and I have no idea how.
These are short range. Good if we want to talk to each other, but useless if we wanna call for help.
Grace. It’s Grace.
You’re bleeding.
You know the story – a girl in a cabin with a gun and a dog.
I’ll tell it to you sometime when you don’t have a needle sticking out of your arm. Trust me, it’s not that interesting.
Turn this way.
I don’t know who killed Tom or why. But I saw them. And so they might come after me, and if they did, and anything should happen to Agnes–
This is hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’m just so angry, and she knows it. And I can’t make it go away.
[ Sniffles ] And what about you? What about the pain you’re feeling, the anger? Can you protect her from that?
[ Voice breaking ] He loved you very much.
She loves Cheerios, and Thomas the Train in the morning. And she gets so cranky if she’s hot at night, so just a light blanket.
[ Sighs ]
Huh?
[ Smiles wryly ] I think you might live.
I need to go check the radio.
An old one in the barn. Used for calling in weather reports. It hasn’t worked in years, but if I could get it running–
I’m a big girl.
If anyone can hear me, acknowledge this transmission. Copy? [ Static ] Anybody? Hello?
[ To Kate, scratching her neck ] Hey. What do you think of these guys, huh? Yeah, I’m not buying it, either.
Like they said, there’s been an accident.
There’s a radio on the plane.
Well, if we could get it to work, or at least get the locator working on the black box, then Search & Rescue could get a Snowcat down here and medevac your friend out.
No, I’m not okay. There’s a stranger bleeding to death in my bed and you could use me out there.
Hey, I got a question for you. These guys, their story anything seem off to you?
They walked 10 miles in this weather? From a crash I never heard.
[ Scoffs ] Not a broken bone on one of them. I think I should go with you.
It’s all right. You’re gonna be okay. We’re gonna get you some help. Your friends are in the other room.
Then who the hell are they?
The Carlucci crime family? What are you doing up here?
WitSec dumped you up here, but your old friends found you just the same.
How are we gonna get you out of here?
Yeah. He’s good. He’ll push through a few more hours. He’s a fighter.
Hunting? I thought you said you were fishing?
Oh, damn it. Sorry.
No, no. You stay put. There’s glass everywhere.
What?
You know it’s illegal to hunt bears.
You done with that?
Excuse me?
My husband gave it to me.
I lost him.
[ Sighs ] Where is Kate?
Kate, my dog.
Where’s Colin?
Have you seen my dog?
Kate? Kate?
Think I’ll brave the weather. She’s probably outside.
Damn generator. It happens all the time.
You do nothing. I’m gonna go fix it.
You know the one that I have learned all my time out here alone?
Men just get in my way. I’ll be right back.
Yes. To Tom’s mother.
She didn’t know who we were. She’s a good person, and she’ll keep Agnes safe. Look, I know you took care of her while I was in the hospital, and I can’t thank you enough for that, but this is my decision. And I need you to respect that.
What?
Of course I’ll grieve. What is this that you think I’m doing?
What’s so great about crossing it? What’s on the other side? Peace? Tranquility?
[ Scoffs ] I prefer revenge.
Really? ‘Cause imagining what I’m gonna do to Tom’s killers it’s the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning.
[ Sighs, sniffles ]
[ On walkie-talkie ] Hey, Billy, you there?
Because you killed my dog and you killed my friend Colin.
And I haven’t killed you yet. I know that man in my room is not your friend, just like there was no plane crash.
Why not just kill him? Why not kill me?
That’s a nasty habit you’ve got there. I noticed.
What’s that, Billy? Billy, you okay? That’s a stupid question. You’re not okay because my name’s not Grace. It’s Elizabeth. You wanted to know about my past? I was an FBI agent.
A profiler. And I smelled you out the minute you walked in my door. That’s why I froze broken glass into those ice cubes you love to chew.
So now every time you breathe, you’re inhaling those little shards deeper into your throat and lungs.
No, Bill. For the first time, I’m feeling pretty alive. So if you want to come for me, you better come ready for a fight, because you know what the four of you against me in the woods is gonna be? Practice.
[ To Mike ] It’s okay. We’re gonna get you out of here. We’re gonna get you some help.
You can apologize to them soon.
Who’s running? I told you I’m here to fight.
I’m healed. I want to thank you.
For honoring your promise. I know it wasn’t easy for you.
I also want to apologize.
I couldn’t honor mine. 
I tried. I really did. I didn’t go looking for trouble. But it found me. And I’m glad it did.
I killed some men. Doesn’t matter that they were bad. That it was them or me. What matters is that I did it and I was good at it. And I didn’t lose any sleep over it.
Maybe. Later. After I’ve crossed the abyss. But from the side I’m on now, all that matters is that I’m healed and – I’m back. And I’m coming for Tom’s killers. Like I said, I couldn’t keep my promise. Can you forgive me?
The police are wrong. They think some ex-con named Navarro killed Tom. He didn’t.
Pleasure to meet you.
No, thank you.
Another time. Someone else killed Tom. It wasn’t Navarro.
It’s good to be seen. How are you? How’s Aram? How are you and Aram?
I’m so happy for you.
I should go.
I want to hear about boring and domestic. I’ll let you handle the case.
Detective Singleton, right?
Much better. Thank you.
Now’s not a good time. Can I get your card? I’ll call you.
I went away. I just got back.
You’re watching my apartment.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
He stabbed my husband.
Navarro worked for him.
And Damascus. Who is he?
I don’t know.
There was no connection. He was helping a friend.
No.
I was unconscious at that point.
What?
I don’t know.
[ Sarcastically] That’s a friendly reminder?
I’m looking for Navarro.
Don’t walk away from me.
This corner is run by the Nash Syndicate. Navarro’s your boss, and I need to speak with him.
I thought I told you not to walk away from me while I’m asking you–
You want me to drive? [ Hitting the gas ] Okay.
You look pretty athletic in that track suit, but I got a full tank of gas, so I’m gonna ask one more time.
[ Increasing speed ] Navarro.
And Navarro?
Keep talking.
If you panic, you’ll run out of air. If you run out of air, you’ll pass out. And if you pass out, you can’t answer my questions. And if you don’t answer my questions, I’ll kill you. Got it? Navarro. Where is he?
And where’s Pee-Wee? 
Pee-Wee.
Crisanto told me you could bring me to Navarro.
And launder money for Navarro.
Where’s he keep the money?
I’m the woman you’re taking to Navarro. Now, you can either bring him a stranger–
–Or you can bring him a stranger who you let burn all his money. What’s it gonna be? 
Remember me? Pee-Wee sends his regards.
Put ’em on.
There was a man at my house the night you killed my husband. He had a Damascus knife. Who was he?
Hmm.
[ Shows a photo of Nik ] What about him? His name was Nik Korpal. My husband was helping him – helping him with something that got them both killed. Then him [ photo of Pete ] – then her [ photo of Lena ].
What about him?
Nik was helping Tom. With what?
[ Panting ] Okay. This is Okay.
I’ve missed you, too.
That sounds amazing.
I’m actually just here to get something out of the files.
[ GASPS ] [ Drops the file ]
I got it.
Distraction?
I don’t really see hunting Blacklisters lightening my emotional load.
I hear it’s going well with Agent Navabi.
I’m here. Not back.
 Detective Singleton. What do I owe the pleasure? 
What about him?
And I got the impression you didn’t want me to.
I don’t believe. I know.
You think I murdered the one person who could ID my husband’s killer?
I’m the last person in the world who would want Navarro dead. Now if there is nothing more–
Results?
Aram told me the penny from Lake Como is actually a treasure map. Do I have that right? Are you on some insane treasure hunt?
He also thought a hunt would be a good distraction for me. I said “No,” but to tell you the truth, I could use a bit of a distraction right about now. He said you were looking for me. I hope it’s to help.
Which I’ve done, mostly – more or less.
The answer is “Yes.”
You’re my father. You need my help. It’s not like you’re gonna ask me to get rid of a body or anything.
Well, if it’s evidence from a crime scene, they keep it downtown in the evidence vault.
They also keep evidence from class 3 felonies rape, robbery, and homicide.
Yes. Now, I don’t have my badge anymore, so maybe the best way to get your penny out is for me to put evidence from that case in.
No, but I can make some.
Any word from the lab?
Appreciative of what you’re doing.
I know you think I’m standing in your way. I’m not trying to. I hope this helps you see that.
Anything yet?
The phone acts as a passive packet sniffer. It’s a trick Tom taught me.
The FBI uses them. I’m sure your tech people know all about them. It can intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital network.
 Great. Now all we have to do is figure out how to get inside.
Hey, thanks again for doing this.
Yes, I told you twice already. Why are you stalling?
You’ll be fine. You got your ID on you, right? Okay, I will meet you at the hospital.
Oh!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Something’s wrong!
He came up to me at the vending machine. He said he was short of breath. Is he gonna be okay?
[ STAMMERS ] Maybe in my purse!
I found the aspirin. Does he need it? Is he gonna be okay?
Is everything okay? Dembe said it was urgent.
Right. About that–
I did not intend to kill him. I intended to get him to identify Tom’s killer. He got the upper hand. There was a fight.
That’s not gonna happen.
I already have. And in the process, I discovered Navarro had a glass eye.
Wait till you see this. Some kind of next-gen technology. I’m sorry I tricked you. I had no idea what else to do, but now I do, and I need your help to do it. Will you help me?
What?
Your penny! Wait. Does this mean you found your treasure or no?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You’re gonna use your penny to buy that?
[ WHISPERS ] That penny’s worth $3 million.
It’s kind of amazing.
I got your message. You found someone who can analyze Navarro’s glass eye?
I know I’m gonna have to answer for what I’ve done, but right now all that matters is we find out who put that in Navarro’s head and whether it can lead us to Tom’s killers – and the truth.
The last time I spoke to Tom, he told me, “I figured it out – Why Nik died, everything.” That’s why I went home – to find the truth. But they got to him first.
You think an empty terrarium is goodwill? Whoa!
And you thought spiders would be a welcome addition?
Oh.
No! Me?
Do you know what Tom was talking about? When he said he figured it out?
I left them for her with your note.
She wasn’t in her office. What did you expect me to do, drive around with them? Besides, what difference does it make if his mother likes you or not? I mean, it’s not like he’s 16.
I need to speak with you for a minute. [ WHISPERING ] He’s a child.
Face-whatever? Really?
[ SIGHS ] Apparently, he also gets “Star Wars.” 
Anything? Yoo-hoo!
Oh, if he can’t figure this out–
So, what does it do?
Do you not know, or you can’t say? – The truth Tom discovered. I asked if you knew about it, and you said, “I can’t say.” Does that mean you don’t know, or is “can’t say” some clever turn of phrase that makes it possible for you to be honest and secretive?
You’ve asked me to trust. All I do is trust. I trusted Tom – forgave every lie, believed every promise that he would stop keeping things from me. And then he went off on some secret quest and got himself killed. And now I have killed someone trying to figure out what it was he was keeping from me. And you have kept so many things from me, I would have to be an idiot to believe that this is not one of them. [ Pause ] Thank you.
For not pulling some Jedi mind trick.
And yet, you’ve mastered it.
You found something?
And what does that tell you?
Yikes? Why yikes?
Tom’s killer?
We don’t know that.
Can they still track us?
We should have stayed.
We ran, and now we have nothing.
I knew it. I knew you were lying.
What? Pursue what? What is it?
An item? What item?
Tom died because of it.
And this item – Did Tom have it?
And now his killers do. That’s why you’re here. That’s– Not to help me, not to avenge Tom’s death, but to help yourself and get your precious secret back.
I gave Agnes up until this is over. If I miss even one more day with her than is absolutely necessary because you’re not being completely honest with–
Hey.
You traced the signal.
It’s about Tom. We think we found who killed him.
We gotta go.
This place is staged. This is my fault. We had him. Damascus was right outside the door. We had him and we let him go. That eye was our last lead.
What? What is it?
I need your help to find Tom’s killer. I need it, but I don’t know if I can trust it.
And you have mine. That I’m gonna honor Tom’s dying wish.
For me to know your truth.
Before this is over, I’m going to find out what it is.
Excuse me?
Someone broke into the evidence lockup?
Step back.
You know, you better be careful, Detective, because no matter what you believe, you’re still talking to a Federal agent.
Thank you for bringing Tom’s things.
I need your help.
Oleander – Tom was still researching the name when he was killed.
So you found something.
A Russian agent?
Thank you for this.
Dominic Wilkinson?
Elizabeth Keen, FBI. I was hoping to ask you a few questions.
You’re not a retired systems analyst, Mr. Wilkinson.
I think you’re a former Russian operative codenamed Oleander.
You were investigated by the CIA.
The case was put on hold due to insufficient evidence, but if the CIA came after you, they had a reason.
My husband was killed over a year ago, and I’m trying to understand why.
There had to be more to it.
You said you worked for Russian intelligence, so you knew operatives.
What about Katarina Rostova?
I never knew my mother.
And you were friends?
Did you know Reddington?
Why not?
Do you think she’s dead? Katarina? I know they say she committed suicide, but there was a man, Anton Velov. He was a Colonel in the Spetsnaz. He said she might still be alive.
Samar’s here to question Bobby, but I asked if you could speak with him first.
­I asked the same question.
This is what we’re here to talk about.
You custom built this for a drug dealer named Navarro.
Call me “Sweetheart” again.
It still isn’t, but I think under the circumstances, it’s what’s best for everyone.
Because I think whoever killed Tom has one, too.
I don’t know, but if he is a cop, he’s not the only one. And I’m gonna need you, everyone, if I’m gonna have any chance at taking them down.
That detective, Singleton, he was in my apartment while I was out.–
–No warrant. Just broke in.
I installed cameras in my house. I had my suspicions, and now I have proof. The lead detective investigating Tom’s murder is a dirty cop.
I have my fitness-for-duty evaluation tomorrow.
You’ve been to therapy?
She’s with her grandmother until this ends.
Until I find closure.
Through revenge. That’s why I need you to help me find another way.
I think it comes naturally to anyone who’s seen her husband murdered.
What about him?
Only that, in order to get my badge back, I need your okay.
Don’t you?
What makes you say that?
My therapist disagrees. And it’s up to her. Besides, I thought you liked therapy.
If Singleton works with Tom’s killer, if they’re both on the force, we’re gonna need the Bureau’s help. And to get that, I need my badge. And to get that, you need to go to therapy. Reddington, please. Singleton was in my apartment.
You don’t know that.
I am so sorry. I tried getting him to come to your office. This is as close as he would come.
I killed a key member of a global conspiracy–
–And in the process, I helped prevent a false flag operation that could have put this country on war footing with Russia.
To find the man who murdered my husband.
Not as much, no.
Is this your way of, uh, pushing me? Provoking me – like Reddington told you to?
I know who I really am.
I’m a widow, a mother, and – a good cop.
That’s all that matters.
About Tom. So I can get my life back on track. That has nothing to do with Reddington.
It isn’t, actually.
Hands where I can see them.
No, you need to put your hands in the air.
Yes, I’d like to report a burglary.
Okay. You want to talk? Why don’t you start by telling me why you broke into my apartment twice?
You think I’m protecting the people who killed my husband?
A dirty cop. But not you.
There is one way. But to do it, I’d have to trust you. And if you betray my trust, I assure you, Raymond Reddington will kill you.
I need to make a call.
Detective Singleton, this is Special Agent Samar Navabi. She’s been authorized by Deputy Director Harold Cooper to inform you about this task force.
You said I couldn’t explain my relationship to Reddington. Look around, Detective. This is my explanation.
So. The dirty cop who killed my husband –
You’re blunt, and I’d like to return the favor. This is a waste of time. I want to be reinstated. I took a big step toward finding Tom’s killer today, and that is not gonna happen by my sitting here listening to your misguided preconceptions. I’d like to straighten you out, get a clean bill of health, and get back to work.
My profile: Widow. Mom. Cop. That’s all there is.
I know you do. Which brings me to fear. You think I’m afraid to acknowledge the weight of having Raymond Reddington as a father.
And one that I shared. ‘He’s evil. He’s my father. I must be evil, too.’
See, that’s our problem. Your preconception. You see him as, um – what did you call him? – a “glorified serial killer”? He “disgusts” you.
When I was little, I loved ballet. Whenever I performed, I felt a presence. At graduations, too. And my wedding. I don’t know. I just always felt I always knew someone was watching over me. Protecting me. Guiding me. [ SIGHS ] Some of what he’s done is unimaginably bad. But some of what he’s done for me – is unimaginably good. So, if you want to push me. Provoke me. Find a way past my anger and grief and see who I really am.
And one more thing.
A daughter. 
We told you about this to gain your trust. Reddington just wants you to help me find my husband’s killer.
We don’t know his real name, just that he’s a cop who’s protecting drug dealers with the Nash syndicate.
Which means whoever killed Tom has a line in on his task force.
We’ll tell them where and when I’ll meet Navarro and that he’s gonna ID Damascus. And whoever shows up to stop that from happening will either be Damascus or someone that can lead us to him.
And I have a request – Take it easy on Singleton. He’s on our side.
He and I have a plan. And if works out, it’ll ID Tom’s killer.
Why are you telling me this?
The only case I’m interested in working on is Tom’s murder.
Nine months ago, Reddington was approached by Jumbal Mazi Okoro, a South African black-market trader who was looking to secure a rare viral agent for his client. Okoro was requesting a pathogen with “maximum contagion capabilities.” Reddington never facilitated the trade, citing ethical issues.
But based on this morning’s incident, Reddington believes this client may be responsible for the attacks in New York.
Thanks, Aram.
Okoro was looking to obtain the same kind of pathogen – a highly concentrated, purified form of organic chemicals.
No. And neither can Okoro, who was killed in November. But based on this morning’s incident, Reddington believes his would-be client may be active on US soil.
USAMRIID. The germ-warfare guys.
Which means she lost access to the chemical and biological weapons.
So the purpose of the outbreak was to hijack the CDC’s server.
The CDC server could give her the locations and access codes to thousands of deadly viruses.
Or Edwards chose her target with exactly that in mind.
Can you really intercept cell phones with that thing?
If I haven’t said it – thank you for this.
Yeah.
I have a daughter too. She’s not with me right now either. She’s with her grandmother. I have to get through this first.
Unsolicited advice – you need a better lawyer.
Deal.
There’s a barcode in his window. It’s a rental.
You recognize him?
You getting this?
He’s leaving.
We’re not gonna get another shot at this.
Bad time?
Yes. A merc, some muscle. But he was reporting to whoever sent him, and that’s probably the person I’m looking for, which is why I need your help.
The guy who showed up – Singleton intercepted his phone. A burner.
I do. One number. Also a burner.
I know you’re in the middle of a big case–
Are you sure?
[ On phone ] Singleton, can you talk?
Almost.
[ On phone ] Did you get that? 447–
What? Why? What good’s that gonna do?
That address – 447 Skidmore. That’s your office.
Not until we get units there. You need backu– [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] Singleton?
I hope not.
[ Sighs ]
[ On phone ] Hey. Singleton, it’s me again. Uh, you don’t seem to be home, and you don’t answer your calls, so I’m getting a little worried. Call me back when you get this.
Singleton?
No. He’s not answering his cell either.
Why do you say that?
[ Whispers ] That’s him. The bald man – Damascus. That’s the man who killed Tom.
He went to his funeral. He was a pallbearer. A pallbearer!
Well, I saw Garvey kill Tom. A lot of good that did me.
You’ve spoken to this witness? Is he credible? ‘Cause if he is, then my testimony–
And you want that?
I told him about the duffel bag.
Where is the witness? Can I question him?
This is Tom’s killer we’re talking about.
So, while you and Reddington go after Garvey, I’m supposed to, what, read a book?
I’m only interested in the man who murdered Tom and finding out the secret that got him killed.
Pass.
Yeah, it does.
His first victim was a female college professor found in Tacoma in 2010. Cause of death was ligature strangulation, but the staging was disturbing, so much that we believe there must be some religious or cult affiliation. Then, six months later, it happened again in Memphis. Then Charlotte. Idaho Falls. Seven victims in four years. Each one found in remote, inhospitable environments, and each one strangled and posed and placed using a hand-forged sword and holding the skull of a horned goat.
This astrological symbol also represents a creature whose natural ability allows them to survive in inhospitable environments. It also characterizes panic and fear.
Agents Ressler and Navabi.
Slightly. We all agreed the unsub was likely a white male, 40s, small in stature, and well organized.
He was transitory. A long-haul trucker, perhaps, or some other kind of blue-collar job that required travel, and that movement gave him confidence.
So much so that his killings accelerated at an alarming rate.
I thought he would stop.
Well, his killings accelerated so quickly, I thought he would feel out of control. Hold back. Go dormant for a while. Others thought he had stopped. I thought he would return.
This sword. The Capricorn Killer forged each by hand, and this one looks symmetrical. Lacks imperfections. You need to notify the lab. Have them pull the weapons from the past victims and run a comparison.
Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe this is the work of a copycat.
Standing there looking at that body, I felt alive.
No. It’s more that – [ SIGHS ] I don’t know.
Because what this unsub did to that poor man in the woods, part of me– sometimes, I feel like I’m capable of doing terrible things like that.
Yes, and killing him, picturing that, imagining that. We talked about how common that feeling is. This is different.
My work on that case was classified. How do you know about it?
Unsolved cases. I fixate on them. How unfair they are. That people get away with murder. I-I know it sounds corny, but I, um– I obsess over the need for justice.
Yes.
I believe what Agent Graves is getting at is that your husband doesn’t fit the victimology of our killer. Wendell had a family. He was known here in town. He was strong, could fight back.
This picture of the two of them some kind of school project?
He made these?
Someone murdered the killer and mimicked his M.O. in the process.
He was. Until he met his wife and had a child. That’s why he went dormant – family. I’m telling you, you pull the travel records from his employer, and they will match the dumpsites of his victims.
[ Begins hyperventilating ]
[ SIGHS ]
So we have two serial killers, both killed using their unique signature.
The profile. Whoever’s behind this. I don’t get it.
Yeah, but how? Most serial killers are white men in their 40s. The man Ressler chased down was a black man. And how is he identifying his targets? The victims are all killers the Bureau can’t identify. And yet, the crimes are premeditated and the crime scenes are meticulously staged. He’s duplicating the work of real-life killers using classified intel that hasn’t been made public – inside information. He’s gotta be–
You’re thinking it, too.
Not just a cop – a profiler.
It makes perfect sense.
‘Cause this is exactly how I would’ve done it.
I’ve been trying not to edit myself.
Intense. Scary.
See, that’s just it. That’s what scares me. I’m not afraid of those feelings. I’m exhilarated by them. This killer is a genius. He saw things the Bureau couldn’t. He solved cases we missed.
I think so. My first case. The Sandman – the one you asked me about. How did he do it? Convince little Susie Baker to leave with him in the middle of the night.
Her shoes were missing. Little pink hightops with rainbow laces. Why would a 4-year-old put them on or let him put them on for her? She did it because she trusted him. And I could never figure out why. What he did – what they all do – sickens me. But how they do it, how their minds work [ INHALES DEEPLY ] honestly, it’s –
Like, take this case I’m working on right now, the profiler.
No, I’m certain of it.
Maybe you did.
Flag him. Not at first, but maybe later. Years later, they could’ve suffered a mental trauma, one that’s caused a psychological shift. If I could get ahold of the medical records of these other profilers –
Dr. Fulton is incredibly perceptive. She sees me. Sees through me. If the killer’s a profiler, I know her and her colleagues would see through him, too, at least enough to flag him.
Do I even want to know how?
Oh, my God. I can’t believe I almost forgot to tell you. The witness ID’d Garvey as the killer.
Yeah. A sweet, innocent kid any jury would believe.
Completely. Aram is overseeing his transport to a safehouse now. He’ll have round-the-clock security from now until the trial. Garvey is going down. If not for killing Tom, for killing a cop.
For the first time, I actually think that might happen.
I know I was just here this morning, but, um, I just need to ask you something and get your opinion.
I’ve been looking over the medical files of the other profilers.
Yes, that’s when I got the idea to do it.
I’ve been looking over them for hours.
I had started to suspect Agent Graves. I thought the files would confirm my suspicions, but they didn’t. Of the 282 agents in the Bureau’s five Behavioral Analysis units, 61 have undergone psychological evaluations. But in the last 10 years, only eight have been deemed unfit for duty and released. Agent Graves was not one of them, but Anthony Hollis was. Top in his class at Quantico. Deemed unfit for duty after a psych eval due to insubordination.
He got into law enforcement because both his parents were killed when he was young.
So, he’s angry. Driven.
I just want to stop a serial killer, and I think you can help me. In your professional opinion, as a psychologist and criminologist, do you think, based on everything I’ve told you, that this could be our guy?
That’s all I need to know.
[ Over phone ] I may have identified the man behind the killings. He’s a former agent. Name’s Anthony Hollis.
He was a profiler. Psych services flagged him for behavioral issues. It’s all in his medical file.
I have eyes on him now. Looks like he’s going somewhere. He may be a flight risk.
You need to roll units.
Reddington got it for me.
Sir, he’s leaving.
He just stopped on Little Seneca Lake. It’s some minimum maintenance road off the westbound 117.
If there were a cabin or a house, I would see it. I’m losing light. [ WHISPERING ] I’ve lost him in the shadows.
Where are we going?
I only ask–
What is this place?
You’re my therapist.
You know who this guy is, what he does.
No, that can’t be!
Don’t.
Do not twist my word–
I am not like you.
Never.
The Capricorn Killer. You knew psych services would reach out to me, assign me the case. That it would lead me to you.
All you’ve done is confess to murder.
Susie Baker –
Why would you bring me here?
[ To Graves ] Look out!
Stop!
[ Pause ] Maybe you didn’t.
I tried. I thought–
I’ll get us a sketch.
Hey, if there’s anything good that happened today, it’s that we secured a witness who’s gonna testify against the man who killed Tom.
What?!
But there was a team. SWAT.
The witness is gone?
No, you’re not.
Aram.
This is not your fault. I’m not blaming you, but five minutes after he was taken, that sweet kid was dead.
[ CRIES ] He already has.
[ SIGHS ] Thank you. This is a big relief.
My father has people he can turn to for help. Doctors. Lawyers. Finders. Freaks. People with special skills. You have a special skill, and I’d like to know that, someday, I can turn to you.
And you knew he was wrong.
I need you to promise me something.
You’re doing everything in your power to get Garvey.
He got him. We were so close, and then–
The bag. The secret. You won’t let them get in the way?
Tell me again. I need to hear it.
Hey, what’s up?
You did not lose him. Garvey took him in a highly sophisticated attack.
No. But if it makes you feel better, I’m in a bad mood.
Cooking it up in their embassy’s kitchen. Aren’t you living large?
Of a country without an extradition treaty. How convenient.
Garvey is what ails me. He took our witness out from under Aram. I’m trying to re-trace how it happened, but if there’s anything you can do –
Will you help or not?
Are you saying this is connected to Garvey?
If he worked for Nash, why was he talking to you?
And you think Garvey found out and killed him first? ‘Cause our agents have an entirely different explanation.
They think it was a hate crime. The safe was cleaned out. Maybe the ledger was in it.
Coogan Hudnutt, publisher of National Pride Weekly and the founder of the alt-right group known as the United Brigade.
When Jawal took over the port in Baltimore, he changed the management team, hired his own countrymen from India.
Coogan Hudnutt and his merry band of xenophobes weren’t on board with that idea. They started making threats. Then, a stevedore got jumped and stabbed, and now Jawal’s been gunned down in his own home.
They tried, but he was already in the wind.
I did. Reddington believes that recovering Jawal’s ledger is more important.
Because it contains the identity of the Nash Syndicate’s supplier – the original supplier, the one with the thousands of hectares of opium poppies that feeds their business.
All Reddington said was that we should use every conventional method at our disposal to find Jawal’s killer.
I think the methods he has in mind are a little less conventional.
According to Reddington, Hudnutt ordered the attack on the stevedore, but he had nothing to do with Jawal’s murder.
I’m coming with you.
What is it?
How great is this? If we could connect this to Garvey–
She’ll think you’ve proposed if she wants to marry you. If she doesn’t, the thought won’t cross her mind.
Now, ever. She knows if she wants to marry you, Aram.
I have no idea. But if you give her the ring, you’ll find out.
Girls from where?
Look at this thread. It includes Orthodox Jews, Mormons, Muslims, Christians. It’s like a child-bride support group. They’re talking about being forced to have sex, forced to be wives in middle and high school.
Whoever it is, I’m sure the girls who hired him won’t tell us. They refer to him or her, as their guardian angel.
So, in order to find the ledger, we’re gonna need to find the killer who staged it.
Were you able to identify him?
Did you give her the ring?
I’m sure she wants to be with you. You’re a catch.
I assume you checked the log books, surveillance feeds.
You- You won’t find one.
B-Because he has no connection to Garvey.
Because he works for Reddington.
[ Angrily ] Tell me it wasn’t you! Tell me that, after we finally found a witness to corroborate my I.D. on Garvey, you didn’t take him!
No. I will not let you avoid a direct question to try and confuse me or leave me in the dark.
Answer me! Give me a direct answer to my simple question.
Not now, Dembe. Answer me – did you or did you not steal Tony Mejia out of FBI custody.
Because Garvey has your duffel bag? He owns you. You betrayed me – the entire Task Force – so that he wouldn’t expose the truth?
Is Tony Mejia dead? Did you kill him?
Because if Tony Mejia ever testified, then Garvey would go to prison, and Reddington wouldn’t get his duffel bag.
Maybe, yes. There’s a customs officer who thinks he saw Mejia board a private plane just a few hours before we issued the BOLO.
[ Shows photo ] And it was this young man you saw. You’re certain of it?
A fedora?
Yeah. We have an idea of who that might be.
We’ve been set up.
You work for Garvey?
Why didn’t you pull me off of him before? I know you could have.
You were watching me in Boston.
I don’t accept your apology for taking our witness.
And why would you apologize for that?
[ BREATHES SHARPLY ] Because by threatening him, you told him how important I am to you.
By telling him not to come after me, you guaranteed he would.
I don’t know if this is your fault or not. But I do know I’m only here because of you. So thank you.
Anna, there is something you could help us with. Reva Jawal’s husband had a safe. Before you left that night, you emptied it out. Do you remember?
There was a book – a black bank ledger. We searched your apartment, but we couldn’t find it.
Do you remember where? Think. It’s very important.
Isn’t this delightful?
Remind me again why a list of drug routes is more valuable to us than the key witness you stole out of FBI custody.
Or of you or the police or the cartels.
[ GRUNTS ] 
I’m sorry. Say that again.
We gave you leads. An evidence trail my daughter could follow.
Do you believe he’s a criminal?
Because either you belive he is, or you believe I’m a liar. I’m just curious which it is.
I’m not in the mood for a matinee.
I had a lead on Garvey. You made him disappear.
How does it feel being a walking anachronism?
The port manager’s ledger?
He’s your lead?
Garvey murdering another cop–
You make it sound like you did me a favor.
Through this Mosadek.
After you get the duffel bag.
What?
Tell me about Mosadek.
Zarak Mosadek is Afghanistan’s Deputy Interior Minister for Counter-Narcotics. He’s also the country’s biggest drug dealer.
Yeah. According to the latest White Paper, Mosadek stalls investigations and generally ensures that nobody he’s associated with will get arrested for drug crimes.
The Nash Syndicate answers to Mosadek, which means Garvey does, too. We get to Mosadek, we get to Garvey. Reddington knows Mosadek is untouchable in Afghanistan. He also knows he’s headed to Paris. He doesn’t know the why, just the where and the when.
Am I interrupting?
Aram? Whenever you have a sec.
If they said I could have it, I wouldn’t need your help.
Information they say is worthless.
I’m sure it will get him to Garvey, but I plan on getting to him first. And to do that, I need your help.
Can you track his car?
And can you control the traffic light?
He won’t be.
Because he is a stickler for the rules. Otherwise, he would have given us the file.
Which you won’t be.
Okay, if it’s any consolation, if he doesn’t have the file, and he is texting and driving, and you do die, I will be very sorry. Now, how long will it take to copy this file?
And came up empty.
Or that’s what’s amazing about it.
What doesn’t happen. What you’re not expecting. What you have no assumptions about.
Look again. Where he goes every Friday at 12:30.
Maybe he’ll be there tomorrow.
At a bar in Baltimore, over 50 miles away from his office. The surveillance team assumed he went for the hot wings, but – does anybody really like hot wings that much? I mean, does anybody know what hot wings really are?
I’m sorry about what happened with Samar. I feel like I gave you bad advice.
Can I give you some good advice?
If you want to propose to her, propose to her.
You don’t know that’s what she’ll say.
I know I said that. I’m an idiot.
Maybe he’s here to meet someone. Out-of-the-way place. No prying eyes.
Money laundering, extortion – He’s here for a reason. Something IA missed, but we’re gonna find. And we’re not leaving here till we do.
And he isn’t here to meet anyone.
Because Garvey hasn’t touched his phone.
So, he’s been here 45 minutes. If the person he’s meeting is that late, wouldn’t he have called? Or wouldn’t Garvey have tried him?
He hasn’t ordered any wings. He hasn’t ordered any food. He came all this way, and all he ordered was a beer.
This doesn’t make any sense. He drove over an hour, nursed one beer, talked to no one, and then gets up and leaves? W-Why? Who does that?
Who is she?
Not to him. To Garvey, she’s worth an hour’s drive just to kiss her goodbye.
I don’t know. But I’m definitely gonna find out.
Hello? Hi. I left my purse.
Sorry. I think I left it in the bathroom.
[ Shows badge ] My name is Elizabeth Keen. I’m a special agent with the FBI. You need to come with me.
The Bureau is investigating Garvey.
I don’t know what your relationship is to him, but clearly you mean a great deal to him, which means you must know a great deal about him.
We’re building a case against him. I brought you here to show you what we know, what we don’t know, and to get your help to fill in the gaps. You can either cooperate or be charged as a conspirator to his crimes.
To begin with, he murdered my husband. 
So that’s what we know. We can connect Garvey to two murders and to providing protection to a drug cartel, but we can’t prove any of it. Tell me what you know, and maybe we can.
I know how difficult this must be for you. Trust me – I know what it’s like to have a father who’s a criminal.
Wait I’m – you were in WITSEC?
Your real father? 
You’re Raymond Reddington’s daughter? 
Because I am, too.
I’m going to honor Tom’s dying wish.
For me to know your truth.
Tell me again. I need to hear it.
My name is Elizabeth Keen. I’m a special agent with the FBI. You need to come with me.
I know what it’s like to have a father who’s a criminal.
I have a daughter.
Her name is Agnes. She’s living with her grandmother until it’s safe for her to come back.
It won’t be safe until Ian Garvey is in prison.
I didn’t force you to stay. I forced you to listen. I needed you to hear that Ian Garvey killed my husband.
Right here! [ VOICE BREAKING ] Right where I’m standing now.
I am being completely honest with you.
I do.
It isn’t the same thing.
I wish we could just forget all of this and get to know one another.
Is there a case hidden in that backhanded compliment?
Clyde Tolson lived here?
J. Edgar Hoover’s lover?
You own the apartment where the homophobic head of the FBI carried on his affair with his boyfriend?
Is this why you wanted to see me?
To get your man and the bag.
Hoover believed knowledge is power. He used his to hurt a lot of good people. You’re using yours to hurt me.
Tom died for a reason. You know why, and you won’t tell me!
Why? What’s wrong?
We tracked Garvey to an out-of-the-way bar where he goes to see a woman.
Just someone he knows. I asked Aram for a bug, which I placed on her jacket.
[ On phone ] It’s a trap – your meeting with Garvey. If you show up, you’ll be killed.
What’s that supposed to mean?
That’s not what this is about.
Are you listening?
I can’t tell you.
You have got to call this meeting off.
And why is that?
I make two from the Nash dicate Just north of the quarry.
Give us the “green.” We’ll take him down.
Garvey’s headed east to 395.
Did he tell Reddington?
It doesn’t make sense otherwise. Garvey was in business with Mosadek. Why would he kill him and not Reddington?
Garvey’s AWOL, and Reddington isn’t answering my calls.
He didn’t double Reddington. I saw him. He was at the meet.
That leaves Garvey. Reddington knew Garvey was coming for him. He got to him first, had him doubled, had the double kill Mosadek.
Well, we know where the real Garvey and the duffel bag are – with Reddington. He double-crossed us.
Very well.
Because if you do, Garvey will go to prison. If you don’t, he’ll be killed.
Yes, he has something Reddington wants.
Did Garvey ever mention that duffel bag? Did he tell you where it might be? A locker? A storage unit?
Where are you?
Think about that duffel bag and where it might be. Helping me find it before Reddington just might save Garvey’s life.
What have you done with Garvey?
We know you used the Alibi to double Garvey.
You expect me to believe that?
I’m not answering that.
Why? So you can get to Garvey first?
I don’t need your protection. What I need is that duffel bag, and I’m about to get it.
Ian Garvey, FBI! Hands in the air! Do it! Now! You’re under arrest.
Oh, yeah. I do. I can’t think of anything I’ve ever wanted more.
Hands on the bar. [ Garvey complies ] I’m listening.
I know. I don’t care.
Absolutely none.
If I can’t get him for the murders he did commit, I’m happy to get him for the one he didn’t.
Don’t do this.
I’m asking you not to.
I think we both know it’s too late for that.
Where is it?
No, he won’t. [ She points her gun at Red ] Because if he does, I’ll shoot him. [ GUN COCKS ] [ VOICE BREAKING ] You’re right. I am unwilling to accept that I am not entitled to know why my husband died. I am hurt. I do blame you. And pulling this trigger, something I desperately do not want to do, is me howling at the moon! Which is definitely your problem, not mine. [ To Garvey: ] Tell the story. Tell it!
Call 911! Tell them there’s been an officer-involved shooting. Tell them it’s a 10-33. Say it!
[ To Garvey ] You will not die. You hear me, you piece of crap? Not until you tell me what you know. You will not die.
Garvey. It’s your last chance, Garvey. Tell me about that duffel bag. I’ll take care of Reddington. I promise.
What was he doing here?
Should he be?
You have a concussion?
How does what feel?
Tom died so I could know the truth – the secret hidden inside that bag. That’s still out there.
And I’m guessing you have no idea where to find it?
Yes.
She spent most of her life hiding from you. I thought I should honor her request.
Good. So you accept that she doesn’t want to see you.
So you won’t go and see her?
Reddington is gonna try and get to this girl.
He is, which gives us a head start on finding out how she’s connected to Ian Garvey and the missing duffel bag.
No name, no parents, no fingerprints or I.D. on file. They think she walked out of the woods.
Reddington was reading it this morning, and when I saw him, he tried to hide it.
This girl is important, I’m telling you. Look at this story – It has all the hallmarks of a case on the Blacklist.
I’m telling you, the only thing that Reddington cares about is finding that bag. Do you really believe he would stop his search to read some random article about a girl with cancer who
Mind if I go in?
It’s okay. I’m a friend.
Did someone hurt you? Your parents, are they okay?
Who took him? What happened?
Just like our girl.
Dr Woerner, thank you for meeting us on such short notice.
How did he explain the present your computer, modern vehicles?
I don’t know what that is, the Contagion.
So, he escaped?
[ WHISPERING ] I brought you something. Rhyolite – to keep the Ollo away. What’s your name?
That’s a pretty name. My name’s Elizabeth. Are you from New Haven?
I know a lot of things, Maybelle. I know about Davies, Cambridge, the infection. I know about the Ollo, but I’m not one of them. Can you take me to New Haven, keep me safe? Are there others like us?
Why did you try to leave?
Your daddy’s a very smart man. What did they do to him?
Mr Moore. I’d like to meet him. Can you take me to Mr Moore?
It’s okay. We’re gonna figure this out.
Is this really necessary?
I’ve got the front. [ To Administrator: ] Notify security. Have them lock down the facility. Tell them our Jane Doe’s been abducted.
[ On phone ] And what about the van?
It’s gonna be okay, Aram.
It’s gonna be okay. Everything is gonna be okay.
Yeah, Moore.
Where our Jane Doe was found.
We found a young girl we think may have seen your missing husband.
New Haven. Where is that?
The girl we found– We think she may be from a place called New Haven.
You think Frost wandered away and stumbled upon modern civilization?
She told me they went in search of modern medicine for her, only to have him dragged back.
The girl.
It’s okay. Maybelle, I’m here to help. Okay? 
Come on.
They’re forcing a stand-off.
We don’t know that.
Aram, I know how scared you are, but you have to calm down. We have a protocol.
How long?
Aram. Aram. Wait!
Because of your husband, Maybelle’s gonna get the help she needs.
And thanks to him, she’s gonna be okay.
That won’t be happening. I just spoke to the good doctor at your apartment. Imagine my surprise when she told me you were headed to Costa Rica when you told me you’d be convalescing at home.
And I never thought you would, but you knew that, didn’t you? Which is why you played that little game with the newspaper article – the one about mysterious girl? You knew I’d clock it, follow up on the case, and go on a wild goose chase while you went after the duffel bag.
I will not excuse you, and you’re not going anywhere.
Because Samar is missing, and I need your help to find her.
Notify security. Our Jane Doe’s been abducted.
What does that mean, “under contract”? Contract to do what?
You mean people?
Which means there’s a paper trail, some sort of proof of payments.
I brought you here to help find Samar, not hunt for the duffel bag.
She did not “pass.” She killed herself so I could get the duffel bag. It was her dying wish. Feel free to honor it.
I’m going with you in case you plan on juggling.
Feltmeyer’s real name is Lawrence Devlin. I’ll work up a profile to present as soon as I get back.
Wait. You’re leaving? We still don’t have Samar.
Knowing that I can’t come with you.
Yeah, I’m sure you do.
According to Reddington’s source, Feltmeyer’s real name is Lawrence Dane Devlin.
As recently as 2005, Devlin held a research position at the University of Tennessee’s body farm – until he came under investigation. Apparently, several of the cadavers Devlin requisitioned turned out to have missing limbs and other body parts.
Yes, but Devlin and all three witnesses vanished without a trace. And since that time, Devlin’s been in the body disposal business.
The list of potential victims goes on and on and on. But they’re exactly that – victims in unsolved crimes who were never found or recovered.
An address on Lawrence Devlin. He has a farm in Preston County, West Virginia.
At the hospital where Samar was abducted.
That isn’t far from his farm. Maybe he took her there.
I have the shed. [ DOOR CREAKS ]
But you know how to get ahold of him, how to reach him.
The stock? Mm. You mean the insects you keep out in the shed?
You know where he does this?
This guy’s serious. I don’t understand. How did nobody know this was out here?
Aram, talk to us.
That river runs for miles.
That means we have to get moving.
A medevac is en route. They’re just looking for a place to land.
[ Holds up her badge ] Agent Elizabeth Keen. FBI.
Gonzalez called you.
He showed me the surveillance feeds. I know Max Birmingham has the duffel bag.
I sent his picture to the Post Office.
By the time I get back, they’ll have his real ID.
Runs in the family, I guess.
What’s that?
No, not one of us. Me.
I’d say that’s a very generous offer.
I’m ashamed of this.
Samar is in the hospital, fighting for her life, and instead of being there for her and Aram, I’m trying to find this duffel bag before Reddington does.
Before he died, Garvey went to Costa Rica to give the bag to a man named Max Birmingham.
Well, for starters, I know his real name isn’t Max Birmingham.
The man we’re looking for is Sutton Ross. In the ’80s, when a company or a country wanted to steal R&D rather than develop it, Ross and his team stole it for them.
A defective stealth fighter called the Grayscape Seventeen. The Navy knew Ross was working for China, so they made sure he stole plans for a plane that couldn’t fly, and when it crashed, China blamed Ross, turned him over to the feds, who issued an arrest warrant, and Ross disappeared.
Because when Ross went AWOL, Garvey was the Marshal assigned to arrest him, and instead of bringing him in, Garvey ended up protecting him.
Yes. Doing business, as usual. Ross and a dozen suspects posing as FBI agents showed up to a robotics company yesterday, waving phony warrants.
Yes and no. The police report says he stole it, and then left it all behind.
That means they targeted Reardon as a way of getting into the office.
Have you spoken to Mr. Desai?
The Rafferty Project – What can you tell us about it?
Thank us? We feel awful for imposing.
Are you telling them what to do?
How do you know that?
That SUV, 3:00 He’s one of Ross’ men. I recognize him from the surveillance feeds.
Give me the keys.
Get out of the car.
Get in the back!
[ On phone ] What?!
Is that a threat?
As soon as I get the duffel bag, he’s all yours.
You’re a fugitive. I’m a cop. You get in my way, I swear to God, I’ll arrest you.
[ Groggily ] Raymond Reddington, you’re under arrest.
You have the right to an attorney.
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you.
I’ll get you for this.
I was too dazed to actually arrest him. And he let Ross go to make sure I was okay.
Ross got away, and Reddington has his driver.
“1500” is p.m., so it’s not a time. And if it’s a place, there is 1500 Winchester in 20 states.
Yeah, I’m fine. And Samar will be, too, if you stop telling the doctors what to do.
So, 1500 is the time – 3:00 p.m.
Kidnapping, impersonating an officer, theft of trade secrets.
Ian Garvey gave you a duffel bag.
The bag. Where is it?
You help us, we’ll help you.
We’re listening.
Why are you doing this?
Five minutes.
I’ll be fine.
So?
Aaaah! Ressler!
Aah! Don’t listen to him! If you breach from the observation–
Don’t listen to him. He’s bluffing.
This is my fault.
I should’ve just let it go.
Mr Kaplan, Tom – We all should’ve just left it alone. They didn’t because they thought I deserved to know, but I don’t. [ SIGHS ] Whatever this is, it’s yours. I should have respected that. The only reason we’re here is because I didn’t. [ VOICE BREAKING ] And I’m so sorry.
No, no, no. No, no, no, no! [ SOBBING ] Aah!
[ Voice-over ] The whole thing ended just like it always does – with the bad guy dead on the floor, with the Bureau confused and upset, but satisfied another scumbag’s wiped from the earth, with Reddington gone, his precious duffel bag still a secret like he wanted all along–
–Except it’s not a secret. Not to me. Because this time, I have a secret, too. I learned that from you, how to prey on the emotions of those that love you most.
Like a charm.
I told a few lies.
I was with Ross. He told me.
[ VOICE BREAKING ] But it can’t be.
Okay. Here’s what I need you to do.
Ressler! 
After that, I made a few demands to buy us enough time to get out.
[ To Ross ] Aram will have those feeds up any minute. I need you to listen to me. You have to make a demand.
A few theatrics –  
[ Acting ] Don’t listen to him! If you breach from the observation–
Not just Ross. He had help.
You. Of course it’s you.
Yes. He said there’s proof.
Yes.
I can help with that.
Again.
If you’re gonna tell him you hurt me, he’s got to believe you. Again.
[ Acting ] No, no, no. No, no, no, no! [ SOBBING ] Aah! 
He will. You have to keep pushing. Tell him you’re gonna kill me.
While it didn’t work like I planned – it worked even better. I got to the truth that you and so many people have died trying to expose. 
No!! 
And Reddington nearly found out about Jennifer. And I think he would have killed her, too.
[ To Jennifer ] Go. Now. Go!
Instead, he got to do what he always does – try and save me– 
–and bury his secret.
Let you die.
I know now that those bones in that bag are Raymond Reddington’s – the real Raymond Reddington. My father.
I know that this man is an impostor. Why he came into my life, why he took your life, why he spent the last 30 years pretending to be Raymond Reddington.
I’m gonna figure all that out, and then I’m going to destroy him.
I know he is. But I’m not alone. I have help.
Oh, yeah.
I’m ready.
Raymond Reddington is a fraud. An imposter who took our father’s place over 30 years ago. The FBI can trace this Reddington forward from ’95. And I know for a fact that our father died five years before that. The night of the fire. Our father, the real Raymond Reddington, cheated on your mother with mine – a Russian agent named Katarina Rostova.
He took me from her in Russia. She followed him to America where we were staying. They got into a fight ~ a fire started ~ I got out, he didn’t.
The only person who knew Reddington was dead was in that house that night, so the person pretending to be him was either there that night, or got the idea to take his place from someone who was, which is why I got this out of storage. This contains everything I’ve collected over the years is connected to the fire. Okay. You can still walk away.
Not if. When.
[ On phone ] Hey. Yeah. Yeah, of course. I’ll be right there.
I’ve spent the last five years learning to act at the feet of the master. It’s my turn to outperform him.
Don’t you look cute.
Spinach. Tai Chi. Who are you and what have you done with Raymond Reddington?
Nothing. Should I?
You want me to find the doctor who helps change criminals’ identities?
Why him? Why now?
Okay. I’ll bite. Sighted where? 
An elusive Russian arms dealer, a very successful jewel thief thought to be dead, a wanted forger who has dodged Interpol for nearly a decade. Three examples of criminals we thought were dead or had gone dark but who Reddington believes are still alive and well and continuing to commit crimes under new identities, courtesy of Dr. Hans Koehler.
Koehler attended medical school at Heidelberg University. Residency in reconstructive surgery at Johns Hopkins. He operates a mobile medical team that travels the globe changing the faces of the criminal elite.
He is considered a pioneer in the application of 3-D computer imaging and modeling technology.
According to Reddington, he and his team were in DC operating out of a bakery in Petworth that was undergoing renovation.
You said it yourself, sir. If that doctor is here, we have to take this case.
Of course. Sir.
Harold. Thank you, sir.
Okay, ma’am, slow down.
[ On phone ] The bakery. We have a lead.
No, on one of his former patients. Basil Vladakis.
Evidence Response found trace amounts of blood in the drain line. We ran the DNA, and it matches Vladakis. Who could lead us to Dr. Koehler. If only we knew what he looks like now. Apparently he got himself a new face.
His predilections?
So you know this guy.
I think Reddington knows.
And I’m not sure he does. But this case he gave us he’s got us hunting down a plastic surgeon who performs facial reconstructions on criminals.
I have no idea. But it can’t be a coincidence, right? And if this is Reddington’s doctor, he might have the answer we’re looking for. So we’ve got to find him before Reddington does.
Yeah. I was taken to a motel in Dover the night of the fire. But I went there. It’s a dead end.
So?
I’ll run a check. See if there was a fire in Rehoboth Beach that night.
You know what this means?
There. 20 steps to the sand.
This is where it happened. The fire.
This is where I killed our father.
They were fighting. My father and my mother. Screaming at each other. And others I think. He was hurting her. I saw the gun and I just wanted to make it stop. I’m so sorry.
I know you have fond memories of this place, but I’m glad it’s gone.
[ SIGHS ] My memories of that night. He had them removed.
He told me he didn’t want me to live with the weight of knowing I killed my father.
He said he did it to protect me –
– when what he was doing was protecting himself so that I would never question who he really was.
[ Shows badge ] Special Agent Elizabeth Keen. We heard you were the sheriff here the night that house burned down.
We were hoping you had a record of the people who were there that night.
We haven’t seen him in over 30 years. He became a fugitive when we were kids. We barely knew him. But we do know this – before the night of the fire, he was a fine man. And then after, he changed. We think the people who were there that night know why. Will you help us find them?
Are local hospitals open year-round?
We’re gonna need a list of every hospital – in a 20-mile radius.
Keen.
You found Dr. Koehler?
Have you alerted Interpol?
You said he was in France.
You have a location?
How did you know he texted?
Did you give him the location? Aram, please tell me you didn’t tell Reddington how to find Dr. Koehler.
Good to see you, Samar.
I thought we were past this.
Alternate agendas. You giving us cases without telling us why. Using us to catch the people you can’t.
And I thought you just wanted us to catch the pygmy three-toed sloth.
And our personal relationship?
I have. Which is why I’m not upset at finding you here. It’s still hard. You’re my father. I want us to have an honest relationship.
How can you say that when you keep things from me?
That’s different.
[ SCOFFS lightly ] I saw Dr. Koehler whisper something to you before he died. What did he tell you?
[ SCOFFS ] You’re serious?
Yes, I do.
Tell you what? 
I never said I kept any.
This isn’t a game.
You cared about him? You expect us to believe that’s all that’s going on here?
We may not know what this guy looks like, but thanks to Samar shooting out his taillight, we were able to trace his car.
It was found in a remote lot at Reagan International. There were two bodies identified at the scene matching the men you saw driving away in The Corsican’s car.
Same reason he killed Koehler and his team –. they knew what he looked like. They were the only remaining ones who did.
All except Moreau.
Reddington never wanted us to catch Koehler.
[ SCOFFS ] No. He didn’t.
I did.
The Raymond Reddington we know can’t be trusted. But there was another Reddington.
It’s hard to explain, but I want to know how the Reddington we could trust turned into the one we can’t. I have to know. Whatever the price.
What’s this?
Moreau knew about this.
Which means his new identity won’t be on this drive.
Where to find this – that’s what Dr. Koehler whispered to you before he died.
I would. But you haven’t really told me yours yet, have you? Not all of it. This isn’t the complete list, is it?
Yours.
For now, but someday I want to see the before and after pictures.
I’m sure you were always handsome.
Neither can I.
But I don’t have to. I know that before everything changed –
– my father was –
– kind and decent and beautiful.
Inside and out.
Well? What did he say?
But can he recover the medical files Reddington erased, – tell us what he’s hiding –
It’s too risky–
He will. Anyone who’s ever gotten close to the truth about who Reddington was before he became Reddington ended up dead. My husband, Dr. Koehler.
[ WHISPERING ] Help me pick these up.
No, he can’t. No one else is gonna die.
Okay. No one.
No.
Hmm?
Of course. Come in. Have you lost weight?
Oh.
Let me look at you. Well, you look fantastic. Thai chi and spinach suit you.
I’m sure you do.
According to Reddington, Moreau wasn’t deterred by the shootout at Dr. Koehler’s operating room or our near miss at Reagan National. Instead, he’s reaching out to arms dealers about an upcoming job.
Reddington doesn’t have any, but he’s reaching out to his contacts now. But if he’s right and Moreau is arming up, that means he’s going to work.
He’s headed to New York.
I already told you, I’m good with it.
Thank you.
What you got for us?
[ To Ressler ] They were on alert because we put word out.
[ To Ressler, whispering ] Well, we already know what it was. Something Moreau’s willing to kill for.
[ To the man ] What else can you tell us?
[ On phone ] Aram, what is it? – Okay, it’s about Albrecht.
That’s how it fits his M.O.
Keen.
He’s headed to the U.N.
A bomb? You know this because?
That’s why Moreau targeted the courier. This was about access.
Well, the badge will get him in, but not the bomb. They’ll scan it at security, stop it there.
Which they won’t seize because it’s not subject to search.
How do you know this?
Maxwell Ruddiger is with you?
Yes.
Do you have a location on Moreau?
Take us there, now.
Sir! Stop.
Put it down. Special Agent Elizabeth Keen, FBI.
We have reason to believe that case contains – an explosive device.
I need you to put it down slowly – and do exactly as I say.
I’ve been authorized to change it.
You need to leave, including all UN Personnel, NYPD responders, NYPD bomb squad, HDU, everyone.
[ To the police escort ] Your men need to vacate the premises.
[ WHISPERING ] Shh, quiet.
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?
You’re gonna pray?
Are you okay?
Wait, wait. You’re gonna leave me here with him and the bomb?
Should be? [ DOOR OPENS ] That’s comforting. [ DOOR CLOSES ] 
Moreau?
What is it?
We lost Moreau, but your weird little German friend did it. He defused the bomb.
We’ve notified NYPD. You got to get out of here before they arrive. [ Pause ] Does it – Bother you?
Knowing that a catastrophe at the United Nations was averted, that people’s lives were saved because of you. That you do – Good, that no one will ever know.
Of keeping your true self hidden.
Whatever happened to tai chi and the spinach?
You go. I got to stay here and figure out how to explain this to EOD.
I just want to talk about our plan.
I know. I do. It’s just, um – Whoever he is, he does do a lot of good.
But we do know who he is. Raymond Reddington. Not the real one, the reinvented one. The one who’s been Raymond Reddington for 30 years, longer than anyone else, and whatever we find out, it’s not gonna change that. This man, the one we know, is the concierge of crime. A very bad man capable of an incredible amount of good.
Aram, what is it?
Sad, about Moreau?
Well, then who are you talking about?
What? When?
[ STAMMERING ] Well, we have to go get him out.
Of course we can. We~ We, the government. We have an agreement.
Does Cooper know?
Is that what you know or what you want?
For Reddington to get arrested so we don’t have to work with him anymore?
I don’t believe you did it, but I do believe you’re relieved it happened.
[ To Guard  ] Can we have a minute? He’s my father.
They won’t acknowledge the agreement.
They’re not gonna release you.
They’re gonna put you on trial.
How?
What makes you think that?
Do you have any idea who it was?
How can you say that?
So you can kill him?
He asked me to find out who tipped off the police. It’s all that matters to him. Not that he’s been arrested or – 
That he’s gonna be put on trial – 
[ VOICE BREAKING ] And face the death penalty.
All he cares about is finding out who betrayed him.
I can’t imagine what he’ll do–
–If he ever finds out that it was me.
Cooper talked to the Attorney General this morning. Officially, your Immunity Agreement never existed.
I’m sure there are other lawyers.
A public defender’s been assigned for the arraignment. Did you hear what I said? Cooper’s been ordered not to inform the court about the Task Force. They’re going to prosecute you.
Aren’t you worried? You’ve been indicted for at least half a dozen capital offenses.
Yeah, you’ve been the top story on every channel.
I saw that. Some kind of underground medical experiment?
You’re facing the death penalty, and you’re giving us a case?
What do you mean he “presents” that way?
And now?
Are you really gonna give her a copy of the agreement?
Don’t.
He used you. Your decency. He knew you wouldn’t lie about the Immunity Agreement. He knew you’d rather violate a direct order and damage your own career instead.
The courtroom’s been cleared. We can’t even watch.
I’ll do it. I’m going crazy – waiting to hear about Reddington.
So, Reddington’s first impression was right. Stark’s a visionary.
Guys, we got a problem. I did what you said, followed up to see if Stark’s contacted any other patients using the Greene Drugs database.
No, I don’t think he has done it before, but he is definitely about to do it again. He’s reached out to a handful of late-stage MCDD patients over the past few days. He’s conducting another trial. I talked to one of the patient’s wives. It’s happening today in a storage facility in Highland Park.
The gun hearing is in a week. You have to argue that the officer that searched you didn’t have probable cause.
If the search was bad, the gun will be suppressed, and they can’t say you violated your deal.
The gun hearing’s in two weeks. [ METAL DOOR CLOSES ] Until then, they’re gonna transfer you to Colton. For security, they want you in an actual prison and not pre-trial detention.
I haven’t told you about Stark.
You were right about him. Apparently, he’s brilliant. He was being sabotaged by his partner, a guy named Ethan Webb.
Oh, hey, come in.
That doesn’t make it legal. Around here, when it comes to Reddington, we kind of see what we want to see. Are you okay?
If there’s anything I can do–
He always has his own agenda. What is it this time? 
Who did this to you?
I can’t believe this is happening.
You don’t look like one.
I need to talk to the warden, get you out of general population.
Okay, then since you insist on representing yourself – also a terrible idea – why not petition the court for protective custody?
Well, then, that’s quite a balancing act, because while you’re getting your butt kicked as a criminal, you also have to demonstrate to the judge your value as an asset.
You have a case?
Rod and Delaine Uhlman married, no children, long-time members of the Methodist church, and owners of Kwik Money Gun & Pawn in Cherry Hill. It’s an unassuming neighborhood shop that specializes in fronting massive amounts of cash to criminals in exchange for high-value, ill-gotten gains.
Yes, if you fail to reclaim your collateral, the Pawnbrokers will resell it.
These cuties facilitated an array of international crimes, including the poisoning of a former Russian Intelligence Officer, the raid of a transport vessel off the coast of Peru, and a casino heist that left eight dead in Monaco. As enchanting as they may seem, they have made possible some very real and deadly crimes.
He’s not fine. You didn’t see him. He’s been hurt. I’ve never seen him like that before.
Aram, heads up. We’ve got another.
That’s, what, six customers in five hours? We’re gonna be here for weeks.
I am. He looked – weak.
Out in the world, yeah, but prison– It’s different.
Sorry. Give me a minute.
It’s not a good time.
What’d he say?
I’m at work. I can’t.
All right. I’ll figure something out.
Did you I.D. the woman?
The MIT grad working at a tech firm?
I-I can’t.
That was the warden at Colton. I’ve been hounding him about putting Reddington in a safer wing, and he finally agreed to meet with me, so I got to do this. It’s important.
I think what my sister is trying to say is thank you for trying.
I think you should go.
Go.
Jen –
It’s done.
– He won.
I don’t. But I’m not gonna let it or him control my life. Besides, it wasn’t all for nothing. If it weren’t for Reddington’s secret, we wouldn’t have each other.
[ INHALES DEEPLY ] I think it has to be.
I don’t like letting her go in there without a wire.
Aram, we’ve got no movement. Are you seeing anything in the store?
[ On phone ] She hasn’t left.
They gave us the slip.
On my way. West stairwell.
Hands! Hands!
We’re under fire! We’re under fire!
All units, 10-71! Officers down!
I repeat, officers down!
They must’ve found out the hard drive was sold to the Israelis. Maybe Uhlman told the Chinese a new buyer was in the picture.
Well, they knew enough to know it was valuable.
Well, I hope it was worth it.
You gave us the Pawnbrokers knowing we would raid their warehouse and find evidence that proves Alfonse Baldomero was innocent of the crime he was being held for.
You know it is.
You really think you’re gonna get out of here?
I’m glad you’re safe, but now a dangerous criminal is walking the streets.
[ CHUCKLES ] That man is capable of anything. He’s gonna get the immunity agreement upheld. It’s only a matter of days before he’s out.
What is it?
The date Reddington was admitted?
So you think if we find a surgery on or around this date, that patient might know something?
Maybe that’s close enough. They might’ve crossed paths.
I don’t. But we’re gonna find him.
You can’t just pause the legal proceedings to give me a case.
The judge is furious!
I know you’ve got a lot of enemies out there, but right now your biggest enemy is in that courtroom.
What if you lose this hearing and they throw out your immunity agreem–
Harris Van Ness? The billionaire big in cargo freighters, died in a fire last week.
You’re being paranoid. It was an accident.
Reddington claims the explosion was a targeted hit aimed at Van Ness because he’s supporting Reddington in ongoing business dealings.
Van Ness is one of a group of associates, some of whom want to sever ties with Reddington because of his arrest.
He’s got a lot of enemies who want a piece of his empire.
Let’s start with the family. My guess is a man of his wealth is gonna have a lot of people coming out of the woodwork.
We understand that the reading of the will can be emotional. We’ll do what we can to respect that.
Uh, apparently neither did anyone else.
It seems like more of a slacker than a killer.
Sure beats the trailer park.
What questions do you have?
Answers to a few questions.
She said she met Peterson a year ago.
Now we know why she isn’t answering.
You’ve got a cousin in Idaho?
I don’t see her among the guests.
No. Deidre’s now “Hiraki.”
He’s got to be in on it, right? Helping her con Peterson?
She left her own wedding reception?
Wait. You know her name’s not Hiraki?
You paid her? To marry you?
What shame? Why on Earth would you lie to your family about your marriage?
What’s that? 
The groom we talked to did it to please his mother.
[ Reading ] MaryAnn. 35. Registered nurse. [ LAUGHS ] Special skills – marijuana distributor with an intuitive understanding of supply and demand. [ To Ressler: ] This would be the perfect date for your cousin’s wedding.
I’m only half-kidding. I mean, we all know how amazing you are, but you’re pushing 40 with no prospects. Why let your cousin in on that?
She’s fluent in Spanish and French.
Does it say who hired her? Sister or brother-in-law?
They had someone on the inside. [ Holds out a photo of Roger ] Recognize him?
And now we know why.
[ To the Bellhop ] I’m gonna need you to take me to your head of security.
Keen.
Don’t move! I said don’t move! Not you, sir. Ma’am, can you please hold the door? – [ To Deidre: ] You. Get up! [ Liz grabs Deidre and throws her back into the elevator ) [ GRUNTS ]
[ SIGHS ] You wanted the fantasy to be real. You wanted a family.
I know what it’s like to be fooled by people who you think are family. I know how painful that is.
What are you doing here?
Why? This doesn’t have anything to do with Reddington.
I came as soon as I heard. Can you appeal the ruling, get it overturned?
The gun’s been admitted. They’ll throw out your immunity.
What are you talking about?
Have you heard it?
Have you heard the recording?
The judge granted his request for a psychiatric evaluation, so as a federal prisoner he’s being sent to the Federal Medical Center in Springfield, Missouri.
How does a psych eval get you that?
I don’t know, and I don’t care. All I care about is that he didn’t give me a case, so we can work on ours.
What are you talking about? We’ve ID’d the man who was Koehler’s patient right after Reddington was. He might know his real identity.
We’re stuck, but if I could get the Task Force to help us–
We can’t give them a case, but Reddington can.
They don’t know that.
Gerald Todd Klepper was a doctor in Newark who murdered 17 patients.
They think, but they don’t know. By the time the police realized Klepper was responsible, he was gone. And in the 28 years since, no one’s found him because, according to Reddington, he had his appearance altered by everyone’s favorite plastic surgeon to the criminal elite – Dr. Hans Koehler.
He says Klepper is a very special case. And, no, he didn’t say why.
Let’s start with what we don’t know – like his current ID, what he looks like, and where he lives.
What we do know is that, according to Koehler’s medical file, prior to his operation, Klepper was on dialysis.
That’s the only lead the police have. But the victims’ families hired a P.I. to follow up, and what he found, we don’t know.
Is there anything you can tell us about him now?
Agents Ressler and Keen, FBI. What’s going on here?
That’s no slip and fall.
MPD’s swept the building. He’s gone.
He never entered it. We think he only purchased it to get access to the victim’s floor.
What do they have to do with this?
Their case doesn’t exist.
The P.I. said he decided who to kill based on some cost-benefit analysis.
You expect me to believe you?
Then it should come as a surprise that he’s a suspect in the murder of Kelly Carter.
Oh, sure you do. She’s the woman who saw you in Rock Creek Park trying to bury that 12-year-old you ran over.
That’s why she was in D.C., to give her statement to the grand jury.
Your lawyers have no idea that Cameron Morella is a serial killer, the one the press dubbed “Angel of Death,” or that his real name is Gerald Todd Klepper and that he’s responsible for the murders of Cindy Kobata, Jim Franklin, Bethany Ray, or that he’s wanted for taking 17 innocent lives, or even if he’s still alive, but I do. I also know that the two of you are in business together. And when I tie you to Klepper, you’re not only looking at a conspiracy to commit murder, but I’m gonna do everything in my power to drag you down with him.
How did you communicate?
Is that the only way?
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ] We have a lead. Tamerlane coughed up Klepper’s number.
Have Aram run a trace on that number. We find Klepper’s phone, we find Klepper.
Maybe it’s because, for once, he’s a bad guy.
Tell me what Aram finds out.
You need to call your friend Buck.
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ] I’ve got a number I need him to trace. Ready?
(202) 555-0170. Gerald Klepper’s new identity is Cameron Morella. That’s his number. Call me as soon as Buck traces it.
They are, but we need to get to Klepper before they do, – so I gave them the wrong number.
I’ll deal with that later. For now, we just need to get to Klepper and see if he can tell us who Reddington really is.
He traced the phone?
[ On phone to Lilly ] I gotta go.
I’ll call you back. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]
You go.
Yeah, I think I’m gonna try to talk to Reddington, – see if he knows anything.
And this is a life-or-death situation. I think they’re gonna let me talk to him.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, y-you’re welcome to listen in if you want, but, with Reddington, you catch more flies with honey, and you are definitely more sour than sweet.
What?
It’s not easy.
[ SCOFFS ]
I’ll let you know what I find out.
Cameron Morella! FBI! Open the door. Mr. Morella, open the door, or a tactical team will storm your vehicle!
Hands where I can see them.
In my hand. Now back up.
I know who you are, Mr. Morella. I know you murdered Kelly Carter to prevent her from telling a grand jury that she saw Digby Tamerlane trying to hide the body of a young girl he killed in a hit-and-run.
I also know who you were, Dr. Klepper.
He says no. But I think this should change his mind.
Look familiar? It should. It’s a picture of you in Dr. Hans Koehler’s medical file, complete with a list of every time he chiseled you or injected you, shaved you down or puffed you up.
Well, Koehler did a remarkable job of changing your appearance. But we both know that he can’t change your DNA. And that when we do take it, it’s gonna match up to his. Isn’t it, Doctor?
Like deciding who should live and who should die?
Have you made it often?
According to Koehler’s records, you and Reddington were patients at approximately the same time.
Whatcha got?
How far away are you?
Lemme know what you find when you get there.
Reddington?
Oh. Yeah. He didn’t know anything.
About Reddington If you didn’t see him, who did?
What’s her name?
What is her name?
We need a name.
What are you talking about!?
[ Pause ] You’re gonna kill yourself. That’s what you do – You stage killings and make them look like accidents.
Wait in the car.
Go.
I heard about Klepper. He must’ve heard you were coming and decided killing himself was better than a life in prison. [ SIGHS ] Is that how you figure it?
I can explain.
[ QUIETLY ] It’s a good explanation. I can’t tell you now, but I’ll tell you some day. For now, I just need you to trust me.
[ Insistently ] No. [ Pause ] But I did– let him kill himself.
Because he convinced me the benefit outweighed the cost. The same way I’m trying to convince you not to tell Cooper what I’ve done.
[ SIGHS ] [ VOICE BREAKING ] I think so. That’s a decision you’re gonna have to make for yourself.
Marguerite Renard. The nurse. We’ve got to find her.
She can’t be hard to locate. And when we find her, we find out who Reddington really is.
I don’t think so. No.
What difference does it make? We’re so close!
That won’t happen. It won’t.
Yeah. I’m not playing this game.
You’re giving me a lead – for you – so that you can keep on doing whatever it is you’re doing.
You gave us The Pharmacist so that Dembe could get five minutes alone with him. You asked for a psych eval so you’d be sent to a mental-health facility where someone you needed to see was a patient.
I want to help you, but I can’t if you don’t tell me what it is you’re doing.
Why can’t you just be honest with me?
There are a lot of things you haven’t told me.
Okay. Tell me about the case.
For over 1,000 years, human beings have been weaponizing insects. In the 12th century, wasps nests were catapulted into enemy towns. During the Cold War, the Pentagon developed plans to produce 100 million yellow fever-infected mosquitoes per month. And the most notorious Japanese war criminal in World War II was General Shiro, who bred bubonic plague-carrying insects that killed tens of thousands of Chinese.
A bit of both. A year ago, a patent attorney was found suffocated in his office. Why? An infestation of deadly beetles had eaten the lining of his lungs.
And six months ago, it was a chemical manufacturer’s turn, and yesterday, the head of a bio-tech company.
Apparently, and according to Reddington, they were put there by a modern-day General Shiro.
Yes, but he wouldn’t tell me why.
Bob Lockemy, founder of Lockemy Technology.
On insects?
I’m sorry. I thought you said he suffocated.
Thank you for helping us.
Predacious?
But that’s what the medical examiner said happened.
But why go to the trouble to make a super bug? I mean, there are easier ways to kill people.
So you think someone from the environmental community targeted Lockemy?
Nikkila told us Hexapene wasn’t approved for commercial use.
So Dr. Nikkila told us the gestation period for these bugs is a week.
Do you hear that? What is that?
[ Knocks ] Mr. Kendel? Hello?
Maybe not.
So much for finding our killer.
This doesn’t make any sense. Lockemy, Steiner, and Helfrich lobbied to make Hexapene legal. Kendel lobbied to keep it illegal.
Not yet. We’ve looked through the tax records on the property, but it’s owned by a holding company. TAC team’s on site now, but he hasn’t showed up.
Why today? A press release is usually tied to a news event.
That’s a relief.
We’ve contacted Capitol Police, but we don’t have a description of the unsub.
He’s not answering. We’ve left messages, phone and text.
Five minutes ago.
Agents Ressler and Keen, FBI.
And?
W-What can I do?
And give you five minutes alone with him like I gave you with The Pharmacist?
It’s also a sealed crime scene.
Did you find what you came for?
He said I reminded him of my mother. That’s what he said when I asked him why he gave us this case.
You know everything.
Don’t you? 
Everything about him. All the answers I’m looking for.
He [Red] said I reminded him of my mother. …
You know everything. Don’t you? Everything about him. All the answers I’m looking for.
I found her. Marguerite Renard. The nurse who used to work for Dr. Koehler walking her dog in an upscale neighborhood no nurse practitioner could possibly afford.
She used to help criminals get new identities. I doubt she wants to chat about it with a perfect stranger, especially one who works for the FBI.
Well, since we can’t go to the Bureau, we got to get her ourselves, get her to talk.
She was in the room when the man we know as Reddington changed his face.
She knows who he was. She knows everything.
You got to remember why we’re doing this. We had a plan, and it is working. Sideline Reddington so we can get to the truth. Marguerite Renard has the answers. Our answers.
Nothing. I’ll handle it. All you got to do is drive.
You okay?
We’re just gonna talk to her.
Excuse me. We’re looking for 95 North?
Get in.
Drive.
I need to show you something.
It’s not mine, but I am in trouble. Will you come outside?
I shouldn’t have come, so –
It’s gonna take longer than that.
First of all, I got a stolen van parked downstairs.
Yeah, well, the thing is – there’s a dead body inside the stolen van.
An imposter.
If I had gone to the FBI, then he would have found out that Jennifer and I know.
The only thing I’m sure of is that he’ll do anything to keep anyone from knowing the truth. Remember Hans Koehler?
He’s the one who transformed the imposter into Reddington, and by giving us that case, Reddington got ahold of Koehler’s files.
Yes. Every file except his.
Jennifer and I were able to track down Koehler’s nurse, the one person who may know the truth, and by the time we got to her, we were attacked by two armed guards. One of them took the nurse and Jennifer, and the other one’s in the back.
Yes. He stole my father’s identity, ruined his name, and lied to me about who he really was. All I want to know is the truth, but in trying to find it, I lost my sister.
How?
Jennifer’s on a plane.
I was tracking her cellphone, and the signal died at around 21,000 feet, headed north over Vermont.
I’m pulling the flight plans for every private plane that left BWI, Martin State, and Tipton over the last few hours.
Marguerite Renard.
I don’t think so. If he suspected me, I’d have known.
And Jankowics is also Hungarian?
It says here he’s also known as “Sarkany,” some kind of multi-headed dragon in Hungarian folklore.
Now we know why she was being guarded so closely.
When she was Koehler’s nurse, she was working around some of the world’s most dangerous criminals. I guess she likes the type. Now what?
I got to call it in, tell Cooper.
Go to Reddington?
Jennifer is not his daughter, because he isn’t Raymond Reddington.
[ SCOFFS ] What am I gonna say? I can’t tell him the truth.
Well, I’ll take that as a compliment.
I need your help.
It’s Jennifer. She’s been taken. Jennifer was kidnapped by guards working for a man named Marko Jankowics.
We’re not. I hadn’t heard from her in months, and then she called me last night, crying. I could barely understand what she was saying, something about being scared and on the run.
You know him?
I don’t know. She said she was stranded in Federal Hill in Baltimore. She hadn’t even started thanking me for picking her up, and SUVs blocked my car and two armed guards got out. I killed one, but by the time I had, Jennifer was gone. And the print from the guard I shot showed that he was muscle for Jankowics.
Nothing. That’s all I know.
If there is, I don’t know it.
You think they’ll know where to find him, – how to reach him?
Where can I find her?
There. Two o’clock.
Ma’am?
We have to ask you a few questions, but before we do, I need to make sure you’re okay.
How far along are you?
Sit down.
Jankowics. I need you to tell me where he is.
What is it? Is it the baby?
[ To Alexandra ] Jankowics. The one they call Sarkany. He’s holding someone, a woman named Jennifer.
Yeah, right. You’re not a grad student. [ Reads ID ] “Alexandra Ivers.” You were sent to deliver Sarkany’s product.
Your boss is holding my sister, my family. If anything happens to her–
Oh, yeah, you sound like the average student to me. SAY CHEESE. [ Takes photo ]
There’s only one number saved to speed dial. It’s got to be his, right? If Sarkany trusts her to make deals, he’ll probably trade her for Jennifer. Hey. She’ll be okay.
[ To Alexandra ] You’re burning up. Something’s wrong. We got to get you to the hospital. You’re probably going into labor.
You don’t know that.
[ GASPS ] Oh, my God. You’re not carrying a child. You’re carrying drugs?!
You’re overdosing.
[ From across the room ] Ressler!
I’ll call 911.
Absolutely not.
Ressler, you need to get in here now!
Pull what out?
She’s OD’ing. They implanted a prosthetic. It ruptured. You gotta get it out.
Okay.
Only a monster would use a woman like that. That monster has Jennifer.
Tell me about Hannah.
She had a key to your apartment. It seemed pretty serious.
Tell me about it. I thought Reddington was my father. I thought Tom was just a teacher.
Say that again.
Play parts, yeah. No, I remember. Brothers, sisters, brides [ GASPS ] You took her to your cousin’s wedding.
[ CHUCKLES ] You make it sound like I said you were a loser. I distinctly remember saying that you were an amazing loser.
And I saw the way she looked at you. I mean, clearly, she saw the amazing part.
That, or she was an amazing actor.
Where’s Jennifer?
There has been a situation. The prosthetic you implanted ruptured. We tried to save her life.
Get in the car.
What woman?
Katarina Rostova? She was there. My mother? Why was she there?
That doesn’t make any sense. Why would my mother help some imposter – become Raymond Reddington?
Not anymore.
Once we do this, we’ll know the truth. It’ll be over.
Ressler? We’re too late. She’s gone.
Without Jankowics, she doesn’t have the resources to run.We can find her again.
We can do this.
We are so close.
I understand how you’re feeling. Believe me, I do. But you’re like me. You will find a way to–
I was gonna say survive.
Where are you gonna go?
[ SIGHS DEEPLY ]
This will end. And when it does, I’ll find you.
Well, that was a fun weekend. My sister left me, and your girlfriend left you.
You think we’re ever gonna find that nurse?
Minister D?
Why now? Today of all days?
How?
You say this Minister D can prove your innocence. Can he also prove who’s guilty?
So you know who the real traitor is?
Have you found out who that is yet?
Tell me about Minister D.
According to Reddington, Minister D gathers incriminating information and then uses it to extort people. In 2004, he discovered an insider trading scheme and used the information to extort $4 million from a pair of traders at Koji Analytics. Six years ago, he blackmailed Senator Constance Holsted after finding proof of a kickback scheme between the senator’s husband and a major real estate developer.
No. But he made it seem as if he has compromising information on just about everyone.
I think what Ressler is trying to say–
–is, we won’t know the truth until we find the Minister.
Yes. With Sayantan Shah.
 In 2006, Reddington loaned him money to pay off a blackmailer he believes was Minister D.
Relax, Mr. Shah. We’re not here to arrest you.
We’ll ignore your business with Raymond Reddington if you tell us about your business with Minister D.
It’s a tap. He was listening.
ome sort of listening post.
Which leaves?
What’s he doing here?
You cannot go to jail to protect his secret.
But if he does ask you to confirm that Raymond Reddington is the defendant, – you can’t say “yes.”
If the only way for me to find out who he really is is for the most honest person I know to commit perjury, I don’t want to know.
I said you were the most honest person I know.  The bar’s pretty low.
But if something were to happen to you because you did that, I would never forgive myself.
He blackmailed him over an affair? How original.
Mikela Pariente, you’re under arrest for the murder of Janice DeReamer.
We heard the tapes. We know you and Peter killed his wife and that Bailey’s blackmailing you. If you ever want to get out of prison, you’re gonna help us find him.
Okay, then. That’s exactly what you’re gonna do.
All right, she’s on the move.
The janitor. I got him.
Uh, yeah, thanks.
Bailey isn’t talking. Please tell me you found something.
Maybe he used the tape to try and blackmail someone who didn’t take kindly to being blackmailed.
We must have missed something.
We have to start over.
It’s gotta be here somewhere.It has to be.
Your scar.
Katarina Rostova gave that to you, didn’t she? She took Zachary from you.
You blackmailed the wrong person.
To cash in on what they’d done.
You hurt a lot of people who deserved it. But you also hurt yourself.
Because Katarina Rostova took someone away from me, too.
So am I. Thanks to your tape [ VOICE BREAKING ] I think she just gave him back to me.
I don’t know how I can feel so relieved and so pissed off at the same time.
I don’t think I could judge her harshly enough. Whoever you are today, whatever you’ve become – It’s because of the lies she told.
That’s no excuse for framing someone for a crime they didn’t commit.
I grew up believing Raymond Reddington was a traitor.
I know a truth.
[ Happily ] Dembe. We won.
Of course I am. Why wouldn’t I be?
Does he know?
He sent you to find out. So he suspects something, but he doesn’t know. Is that it?
If you tell him, he’ll never forgive me.
You’re his secret keeper.
I’m asking you to be mine, too.
[ SNIFFLES ] 
I know what you did.
You lied to the judge – to protect my search–
–for the imposter’s true identity. You ignored everything I asked you not to do. And I just wanted to say thank you.
To be honest with you, Ressler, this has all been hard. Ever since I met the imposter.
But, yes, especially now, knowing that my mother helped this imposter steal my real father’s good name.
You want me to make a dinner reservation for you? – In Chicago?
Have you read the indictment? There are 16 counts, ranging from money laundering to murder.
How can you be so confident?
Your beef brochette.
[ SCOFFS, sing-songy ] You are full of fantasies today.
And when you know, you won’t say until they reinstate your immunity agreement.
I’m pretty sure he also said “first do no harm.”
Tell me about the Cryptobanker.
A drug cartel spends $70 million on airplanes. A Serbian sex trafficker drops $40 million on ships to smuggle victims across the Mediterranean. How did the people brokering these deals keep them hidden? They took payment in Bitcoin.
And where do they go to launder their ill-gotten Bitcoin gains? To a man known as the Cryptobanker.
All Reddington knows is that the Cryptobanker is in town. So we reached out to the Bureau’s Virtual Currency Initiative, looking for someone local trafficking in Bitcoin, and one name stood out a hacker known as the RAT.
The leading manufacturer of pacemakers, called Pierson Diagnostics.
Reddington pleaded guilty.
The minute the Feds threatened to take us down with him, he gave up. He pleaded guilty to protect us, and they’re gonna kill him for it.
He knows. That’s why he’s done this.
Cooper thinks you have a plan.
He’s optimistic that you giving up isn’t what it appears to be.
Why? Because you have a plan? Or because you’re gonna be dead soon?
I understand witnesses you’ve never even met are testifying under oath that you’re evil incarnate.
I’d like to present the other side.
They’re taking witness impact statements. No witness has been impacted by you more than me.
I want to testify.
Why? Do you have somewhere you have to be?
What I say might not make a difference, but it could. Why would you want me to rush through it? Unless you don’t care what’s on their minds because Cooper’s right – you have a plan.
Yes.
I was 15th in a class of 200.
By the very best.
[ Long pause ] You’re a fugitive. [ Pause ] You live a fugitive’s existence. Fleeting. Transient. Impermanent.
Almost exclusively, this is how you interact with the world in [ Pause ] short, brief, passing encounters. [ Pause ] I say “almost” because this is not how you interact with me. With me you are enduring, permanent. The world thinks you’re bad because you’ve done some terrible things. But I believe you’re good in spite of the terrible things you’ve done. And I know that you’re not here today because of those terrible things. You’re here today because of love.
He asked the jury to execute him. He didn’t even try to make a case for life in prison.
He said that, if he was locked up, he would have nothing to live for. Look, I know you think he’s got some plan up his sleeve, but I don’t know. There’s something wrong.
I’m at Colton now. I’m gonna figure out what the hell’s going on.
Elizabeth Keen, here to see Raymond Reddington.
What the– ?
You know, if you had told me what you were up to, I wouldn’t have shown up and gotten in the way.
Not that it matters now, but we have him in custody.
What good will that do? You pleaded guilty.
For the man in Cairo.
Let’s hope the jury is, too.
This is a transaction report generated by a business deal between you and a man in Cairo. I’m gonna ask you one question about this report. Answer it honestly and I’ll tell Main Justice you provided the FBI with vital intel. I’m giving you a gift. I hope you’re smart enough to take it.
This report indicates you laundered $5 million worth of Bitcoin for him. So you may not know his identity, but you know where you sent him his money. And that’s my question. His money – Where did you send it to him?
I have to find the man in Cairo.
The why is simple – Reddington believes the account holder can tell us about the conspiracy.
It was. The Cryptobanker laundered $5 million for a man in Cairo who can tell us what we need to know–
Reddington assumed the Cryptobanker could lead us to the man in Cairo. He thought all we had to do was ask him where he wired him his laundered money.
But the man in Cairo didn’t want his money sent to him. He wanted it sent to someone with a numbered account – in Luxembourg.
That’s what we have to find out.
Except for the fact that we’re not asking for your help.
Me and Dembe.
There’s no time to plan and little hope for success. It’s a mission that will likely end in our arrest. That’s a chance we’re willing to take. We don’t expect anyone else to take it.
I know. That’s why I’m not going to ask them.
No, you’re not.
That’s beside the point–
–us breaking the law. Me and Dembe. We’re his family.
Do I have a choice?
Okay, then. What’s your plan? 
If we expect to have any hope of saving Reddington’s life, we have to name this depositor at the Banque Vertrauen. To do that, we have to access the bank’s computer networks. The problem is, Vertrauen has criminal accounts around the world, meaning they’re very private, so they maintain networks that they claim are impenetrable.
All except one. According to Reddington, the bank president is able to override the network using an encrypted fob he carries at work.
We don’t know. The bank doesn’t make that information public.
Aram, how long do you need with that key fob to know if you can override the encryption?
And anyone who can decrypt it can clearly duplicate it, right?
[ SIGHING ] Oh. Excuse me. Do you speak English?
Oh, thank you! I’m looking for the residence of the Duke, and I promised myself I would not use my phone this trip. But, uh, these paper maps are impossible.
Okay, thank you.
Oh, no. You can’t go. No, I- T-Tell him he can’t go. I wanna pay for his lunch.
I don’t want him to think I’m an ungrateful American.
I insist!
Uh, wait, sir.
You can’t go. Uh– Okay, If you won’t take my money, let me pay for your lunch.
If you won’t take my money, then at least, um –
[ Calling after him ] Can you tell him, please, that he has a beautiful city and thank you so much.
I don’t know. But we’re gonna find out.
I think I should be a witness at Reddington’s execution.
But what man?
But what if we can’t, or he doesn’t? This is my last chance to find out his true identity. And maybe if this is his last chance to tell me, he will.
What you said about Ziegler – we were able to corroborate it. We can prove the conspiracy’s real.
Panabaker got Cooper another meeting with the President. He’s gonna make the argument that, in order to save her life, the President has to save yours.
What I want to do is save your life.
I’m trying to tell you – this might not be your final meal.
This is what you call a last meal?
Cabbage soup and herring.
I can’t imagine that. You as a boy.
And your mother?
About who you used to be – there’s something I need to ask you.
I did. [ Smiles ] I wanted to ask you – I-I wanted to ask [ Pause ] how can you eat that?
I mean, honestly, it’s the worst food I’ve ever seen. Your mother may have been a wonderful person, but she was a terrible cook.
This can’t be your last meal. It’s the definition of cruel and unusual.
It’s Cooper. [ QUIETLY ] Have you seen the President? But she’s in danger. She’s not safe.
I know it seems that way, but you and I both know this isn’t over.
The President’s wrong!
Thank you for trying. Of course. I’ll tell him.
[ VOICE BREAKING ] He says he wishes there was more that he could do.
I love you. [ QUIETLY ] That’s what I wanted to say. That’s what I wanted you to hear.
He did it. He called.
The President. He stopped it.
The execution. He called it off.
They took out the IVs, and he just walked away.
I don’t know if he got clemency or a stay or what. But all I know is he’s alive. Will you tell Cooper?
Ohh! I can’t believe you’re here! [ LAUGHS ]
So where is he?
The assassin who killed the German spymaster.
What? But you said–
You seriously have no idea where he is?
I didn’t get the chance to.
[ Evasive ] I’m gonna get Samar and Aram.
Reddington’s back. Cooper wants us.
Isn’t he the sociopath who tried to bomb the UN?
Your competency evaluation – you requested it because you wanted to be transferred to that psych ward in Springfield.
Who deposited the money in Jonas Kruger’s account at the Banque Vertrauen.
Or trying to. We stopped the bomb at the UN from going off. If Moreau was trying to kill someone who knew about the conspiracy, that person is still alive.
I just talked to Ressler. Moreau got to Miles before we could. Now he’s dead, and Moreau got away.
Gone. You were right about Miles. He compiled it. Before he died, he told Samar it was password-protected.
Yes. “Foxglove.” But it doesn’t do us much good if we don’t have the dossier.
We got nothin’. No leads on the Corsican.
How? Who? Uh, hold on.
Cooper and Ressler are here. I’m gonna put you on speaker. Okay, say that again. You said you know Moreau’s next target?
Okay. What?
You have a lot of explaining to do.
Moreau is motivated by some warped political idealism. He’s a nationalist. So why target a deputy AG like Anna McMahon?
And why go after Reddington? How does he fit in? 
That’s him! He’s on the move!
Stop! FBI!
FBI! I said stop! Hands where I can see them! Show me your hands!
Turn around. Put your hands on the car.
You did all that work to change your face, and look where it got you.
It came from the north.
Almost over. You still haven’t explained why Anna McMahon wanted to kill you or why the Corsican tried to kill her.
Moreau confronted McMahon with it. Now he’s dead, and it’s gone.
I decided not to.
I am. And I hope you are, too.
You mean, somebody actually taught you how to drink this early?
He conned you.
Why not?
Robert Vesco was a central player in American financial and political scandals in the 1970s. In 1971, the SEC accused Vesco of looting $200 million out of a mutual fund he controlled. And a year later, Vesco made an illegal campaign contribution to Richard Nixon, hoping that Nixon’s attorney general would let him off the hook. And when he didn’t, Vesco fled the country, living the rest of his life in glamorous exile in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, The Bahamas, and Cuba, where he reportedly died in 2007.
When Reddington was in prison, he heard a rumor – that Vesco faked his death to avoid capture.
He sent Dembe to Havana to dig up his grave. He asked me to have the M.E. run the DNA on the remains he unearthed.
Reddington agrees. He thinks Vesco found the De La Cruz – a Spanish ship filled with gold that sank off the coast of Florida in the 1700s. Vesco always told him that if he found that treasure, that he would disappear forever.
­Know him? Vesco was Reddington’s mentor until he swindled him out of every penny he had and left him high and dry in a whorehouse in Paraguay.
Who’s that?
It says in his file, Mount was in Truro, Nova Scotia. If you want to get off the grid, you can’t get much further than that.
Come on. We’re gonna need warmer clothes.
So much for glamorous exile. I don’t get it. Why would Vesco fake his death so he could live here of all places?
We talked about this – Reddington said a guy like Vesco would have every cop in town on payroll. We go to them, they tell Vesco, and he slips away.
Vesco, or whatever he’s calling himself he would have the resources to go anywhere he wanted to – create any life.
Whatever brought him here, it’s personal.
He’s on the move! Alley to the east! On foot!
Crossing Acadia Street! Headed east! Blue denim. Tan sweater.
[ SCOFFS ] Reddington. Like I said – whatever brought him here, it’s personal.
Reddington wants more than revenge. He wants treasure.
Reddington called us from his jet to give a gloating apology and to say the hunt was on.
It was written under a pseudonym. The author is a mystery, but when Reddington gave us this case, he said this poem somehow holds the key to where the gold was hidden. 🔘 [See Note]
Hi. Agents Keen and Ressler, FBI.
We got a poem we’re looking for. We think it may be some sort of treasure map. I know that sounds crazy–
Two old white guys.
The answer’s here somewhere. I’m sure Reddington figured it out.
Aram, did you find him?
Mr. Homan?
So, Reddington made an anonymous donation to an arts organization?
Aram, you’re a genius. Reddington just bought tickets to the opera in New Orleans, just like the one mentioned in the poem. So we don’t have to decrypt it.
No. We’re going to the opera.
He gave me his word. I believe him.
I’ll talk to fire.
Mr. Carter.
Elizabeth Keen, FBI. Can I talk to him for a minute?
Drop the act. Where is he?
Reddington. He was here. How long ago? Don’t lie to me.
I’m at the opera house.
You got your treasure. Now I want Vesco.
Where’s Vesco? He inside?
You let him go.
So you commuted his sentence? Like the President commuted yours?
[ LAUGHS ] He’s reformed, is he? “Given up greed and avarice”?
[ LAUGHING ]  I’m sure he’ll be a real ascetic with your $100 million.
It doesn’t. But it’s a start.
Smile, suckers. [ Laughs ]
Dembe.
Health kick?
Burned agents always are.
Something tells me they don’t sell umbrellas.
The KGB farms out hits?
The world’s intelligence agencies have a go-to company for contract kills?
They sent killers after my mother?
Kevin Major, Nicolai Druganin, Shirley Wei. All agents for MI6, FSB, and the Singapore Security and Intelligence Division, who Reddington claims were murdered by the Osterman Umbrella Company.
Reddington says they were traitors that their agencies had terminated.
Not only is the CIA involved, but that the next hit’s going to take place in America.
He made it sound like this was accepted practice.
How well do you know them?
Which is why we couldn’t pull a search warrant.
They would if we turned up the heat.
We got here before the cleanup crew.
It’s the dropped token.
The person they’re targeting.
[ On phone, to Red ] It’s Samar. She’s the target. But we can’t get ahold of her or Aram and no one knows where they were headed.
Last night. Aram told Cooper he wanted to take Samar away for a few days. You don’t think the Umbrella Company got to them already, do you?
I don’t understand. Who would do this? A state-sanctioned hit?
It’s got to be them, right?
What could Samar possibly know that would make her such a liability to the very agency that trained her?
And what are you gonna do?
[ On phone ] The room’s destroyed, and the assassin’s dead.
hat’s why she and Aram aren’t here. They’re on the run. But why? Have you found anything?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, and she recovered.
Okay, so she didn’t fully recover. So what? Why would Mossad want to kill her for that?
That’s why they’re coming for her, because someday she may not be able to keep a secret?
We’ll have Cooper reach out.
Yeah, but if we didn’t know, how did the Mossad find out? 
Are you sure this is what you want?
The reason she’s asking you that is because, for most people, it isn’t so simple.
[ SIGHS ] Why is it that men think the only way to handle a problem is to be stoic?
Aram is completely shut down.
He’s gonna implode.
You want us to take down an honest cop?
She helps one criminal organization take over another?
Are you siccing us on a criminal or a corporate raider?
Why are you telling me all this? You’re usually annoyingly guarded about your true motive for giving us a case. Why are you admitting that you’re giving us this criminal to expand?
Are you telling me Olson has intel on Anna McMahon?
I know. It’s tricky.
It’s incentive enough for me. We are nowhere on figuring out what McMahon is doing. She’s a top-level justice department official who has the ear of the President and is orchestrating a conspiracy so dangerous she had to hire a hit man to kill the people who found out. And she wanted Reddington executed. And despite all that, somehow she’s now our boss.
Well, for starters, her name isn’t Olson. No one knows her real identity, only that she’s a former Wall Street analyst who made a fortune doing quantitative risk analysis for private equity firms.
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown, she re-emerged as a corporate raider for the criminal underground
Her approach to the Collington police department is typical. She identifies vulnerable businesses and then target maps them until she knows every pressure point, which she then exerts to strip them of their assets or absorb them.
Reddington says her clients range from a real estate developer in Boston, to a crime lord in Mumbai, to Ukrainian oligarchs. She commands a seven- or even eight-figure fee to help them expand into both criminal and legitimate businesses.
Reddington says she has a meeting with a prospective client. He gave me a time and place.
Reddington always has an alternative agen–
–The only difference is that we actually know what it is this time.
Aram, we have a visual. Is everybody in place? [ To Ressler ] We’re not done talking about this.
Reddington’s the new client?
No more than you. Reddington’s inside.
It sounds like she’s on some sort of video feed –
Can you trace it?
What is he doing?
Where else could it be coming from?
How close?
How high?
We’re headed north on Culver.
Okay, what exactly are we looking for?
That’s it. We’ve got her.
Ressler!
Because he gives us high value criminals and it makes the world a safer place.
I know this is hard for you, but whoever he is, he’s looked over me since I was a child. So if I can accept that his real identity is none of my business, I need you to accept that it’s none of yours either.
Olson.
[ To Aram ] Tonight – You, me, and as many pitchers as it takes to thoroughly drown sorrows. Deal?
FBI. We have a warrant to search this building.
You. What is it?
What are you trying to tell your friend?
Eric, you’re what – 20? 25? By the time we’re done here, you could spend at least that long in prison for any number of crimes–
–including obstruction, securities fraud, aiding and abetting. So how about you help us out and tell us what you know?
Take it offline now. I said take it offline!
Cyber’s en route, but those drives are fried. Someone with a lot of skill’s gonna have to put those pieces together.
We got a problem. We have reason to believe Olson’s planning an attack – probably to leverage her next takeover victim.
That’s the problem. We don’t know who, where, or when. All we have are pieces of encrypted files from her servers. Cyber just showed up. We’ll send over whatever they decrypt.
 I tried him. He didn’t pick up.
Anything on the attack?
Nothing concrete, strings of data. A few partial names. Some routing numbers to a bank in London.
Yeah, but we don’t know to what. It appears to be some sort of event space, but it could be anywhere.
Tell me you know something.
Hey. Aram?
Uh, where are you?
Manhattan? What makes you think that? I-I’m putting you on speaker.
There. That’s it.
Aram, you’re the best. Tonight the pitchers are on me.
Mr. Cobb, Elizabeth Keen, FBI. We have a credible threat that your building is the target of an attack.
You need to evacuate immediately. Do you understand? NYPD is en route, we need everyone out.
We’re not sure yet.
Ressler!
FBI! Stop!
Yeah, well, this’ll come in handy.
[ SIGHS ]
Hey!
I thought you said you were going to be with Samar.
And did you see her?
That couldn’t have been an easy decision to make.
What? Why?
You bet. Uh, just let me finish this case report.
Are you coming or going?
A-And that’s a bad thing?
What’s the catch?
An urban legend that Reddington claims is all too real. A Blacklister who serves up salvation in one hand and damnation in the other.
Reddington doesn’t know, because no one’s lived long enough to say.
Yes, someone Reddington claims has done business with the Third Estate and may be able to tell us about their plot against America.
Or maybe Lady Luck convinced him to gamble with his own life.
This is a screen capture from a CCTV camera in Atlantic City. Apparently, he lost pretty big there.
She was a gambler, too.
He’s in interrogation. I’ll take it.
It’s okay. We’re working on the same case.
Maybe Morris and Nagel were in recovery together.
I thought we had an agreement.
CIA documents from the Russia desk? Some kind of passenger manifest from ’91? [ Shoves him ] You’re looking for my mother.
I told you, I’m not interested in digging this up, and I’m certainly not interested in you digging this up.
Thank you.
I’ll call in the surveillance op.
Every word. Tango Team, the minute you get verbal confirmation, move in. Assume he’s armed.
You think his wife tipped someone?
FBI! Hands!
Henry Morris, you’re under arrest for the murder of Betsy Nagel.
What kind of information?
How? What exactly did she say?
And by “taking care of” someone, you mean drowning Betsy Nagel in her bathtub?
Henry, you were never gonna get away with it.
It’s gamblers killing gamblers. Lady Luck identifies her target, someone who has a significant amount of debt, to be her hitman, and then she offers to pay off that debt in exchange for the killing.
Using money she’d gotten for killing a gambler.
Which means she won’t stop.
Why pick this place to meet?
[ Listening in ] That’s got to be her.
She’s not in here.
She’s bailing. She’s bailing.
I got nothing.
How’d she get away from us?
Agents Keen and Ressler, FBI. Is she here?
Why would she do that?
She’s using it as a slush fund to finance a series of murders.
Because she knew we were coming. Ma’am, if you have any idea where your mother might be, you need to tell us.
[ On phone ] She’s gone, and her daughter says she doesn’t know where.
Her husband died less than a year after his accident.
Aram, send us that address and get us HRT out of Quantico.
If there’s no death certificate –
But why would she lie, to her daughter, of all people?
Okay. I get it. You can’t always trust family. But that could mean –
FBI!
It’s over, Agathe.
You need to put that gun down.
I don’t know where it is. Find it!
That’s good, Henry. But right now, I’m not interested in Lady Luck. First, I want you to tell me everything you know about a group called the Third Estate.
Red was right. Henry Morris is connected to the Third Estate. He gave them state-of-the-art surveillance equipment so they could penetrate high-end security systems – in private homes.
No, they contracted through encrypted wire transfers and dead-drops. But think about it. The Third Estate is the 99%. If they’re plotting against America, where else are they gonna start than by attacking the 1%?
Yeah, well, it’s 99% smaller than it was a few minutes ago. I’m gonna go tell Cooper.
[ SIGHS ] By the way I’m sorry I snapped at you before.
You’ve been on Reddington’s case longer than any of us, and you deserve to know who he really is.
I owe you one for letting it go.
Anyway, what is it?
This is a first–
–You answering the door?
Where’s Dembe?
In the six years I’ve known you, I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve seen you without Dembe, so, yeah, I’m listening, for an answer to my question.
About what?
Which is?
Our 99% wants to soak the rich, not kill them.
The surveillance equipment.
That’s terrible, but I seriously doubt kidnapping rich kids is the plot against America Anna McMahon is orchestrating.
Like the rage you have against the person who turned you in.
Anna McMahon oversees all our cases. So if we bring this to her, she’s gonna know we’re going after her.
You’ve heard of them?
According to Reddington, they’ve kidnapped the children of some of the wealthiest people in the country.
Because they threatened to kill them if they told anyone, so they made payments in private.
Unlike the others, his parents refused to make the secret settlement and went straight to the NYPD.
You have every right to be angry. And when you’re angry, it’s difficult to trust people. But you can trust us. Our only interest is Des’ safety.
[ Over comms ] Relax. You’ve got eyes all around. We’re gonna bring your son home.
Aram, you good?
Aram, heads up.
Aram, talk to me. Tell me you can pull that audio.
He dumped his cell. Asset’s on the move, headed south on Fordham. Aram?
Aram, let me know if you get a visual and a location.
Mr. Foy, please calm down.
There’s got to be a clue in here somewhere. The wardrobe, those masks. Why are they wearing those masks?
They look like death masks.
Des Foy is dead because his father refused to pay the ransom. That’s on him. If we don’t catch these guys and someone else dies, that’s on us. – That’s it.
The rack.
That’s our lead.
[ On phone ] Antique weapons. The rare and the macabre. Do you know who trades in them?
I’m texting you a picture of the rack used by the kidnappers. Can you send it to her and tell us what she knows about it?
Remember the getaway car? Black Mercedes?
Aram uncovered a suspicious-vehicle report filed 48 hours ago: Black Mercedes G-Wagon, no plates.
Della Whitmore, the pharmaceutical heiress. Apparently she spotted the car loitering outside her mansion.
22-year-old son.
Mrs. Whitmore, I need you to tell us exactly what they said.
This is a terrible situation, but I have to tell you that the last person whose son was taken refused to pay the ransom, and his son was killed.
Absolutely. These are kidnappers, not killers.
I-I’m sorry, yes. And they will pay dearly for that. But what I’m trying to say is that everyone who has paid the ransom has gotten their child back.
Actually, it’s not.
Of course. Take your time.
I was about to ask you the same thing.
That’s your decision?
Anything?
Unsubs?
What are you getting at?
No. They’re thinking about breaching, but they don’t know the layout, how many people are inside, or how heavily armed they are.
Des, talk to me about the ransom money. I need to know where it was sent. I need a name. All your friends are going to jail. If you cooperate, we can help you. The money. [ Inhales ] I think you kicked it upstairs to the head of the Third Estate. Who is he?
Des, we need your help. Talk to us about who runs the Third Estate.
Reddington told me you two had a falling-out.
[ Whispers ] He can’t know who turned him in.
So? He looks. It’s a puzzle he can’t solve. So what?
Maxwell Ruddiger? What about him?
So?
Ruddiger’s a friend.
You think he’d do something to Ruddiger?
Is that what you’re gonna do? Come forward?
Has the meeting been set with Ruddiger?
And do you think he’ll kill him just to set an example?
[ SIGHS ]
I’m familiar with the concept of a podcast. Everyone is. No one listens to them on audio cassette.
The one about the serial killer who froze his victims?
Isn’t he getting a new trial?
It could be a copycat.
So you think he orchestrated the murder from prison. Do you have any evidence?
And there will be two killers on the loose.
Your lunch with Ruddiger. You should cancel it.
Because you’re going to ask him if he turned you in to the police. He didn’t. I did.
I asked him not to say anything. It’s not his fault! It’s mine.
You knew that–
If I had–
If I’d known what was gonna happen–
Yes.
No! The only thing I knew is – you aren’t who you say you are.
I do.
Yes!
I thought it justified anything, yes! But I don’t anymore.
Because you almost died! [ VOICE BREAKING ] Because I came face-to-face with losing you, and I realized that I don’t care about who you were – I care for who you are. And that’s the only thing that matters. You- You have to believe me.
I don’t really want to talk about it.
Ressler.
Can we please just go to work? 
The Brockton College Killings were a series of murders that took place on Brockton campus in 2013. Over a year and a half, three women – Krystala Norris, Lauren Key, and Melissa Seymore – were found dead, their bodies staged like frozen statues. Besides going to the same school, all these three women had in common was a connection to a fellow student named Tobias Carlyle. Norris shared several of the same classes, Key worked at the diner he frequented, and Seymore was a writer for the school newspaper where he was a photographer. In fact, she had last been seen in Carlyle’s dorm. Forensics recovered his semen from her body.
This case has gained international attention recently because of “Thaw,” a podcast hosted by Kimberly Owens. Owens believes Carlyle is innocent.
That they’re working together to make it look like he’s innocent.
Her name is Jenny Marciniak.
We’ve looked into Carlyle’s visitor records, call logs, even his commissary account.
Nothing yet, sir.
The police never figured out where the bodies were staged.
Looks abandoned.
Ressler.
It’s Dembe. I’m worried about him.
He wasn’t okay with what I did. And he certainly wasn’t okay with Dembe keeping it secret.
What?
Aram, you’re a wizard.
Adrian McCaffrey. Where is he?
So, it’s confirmed the B&B in West Virginia can provide documentation that McCaffrey and his girlfriend were there the weekend Lauren Key was murdered.
A cabin he claims he never uses. Maybe McCaffrey’s right maybe the killer knew that and put Marciniak there so we’d blame him.
Then a guilty man may have just been set free.
I might have a lead – the liquid nitrogen.
I spoke to the lab. They managed to isolate a partial print on the bottom of one of the canisters we found at the cabin. Belongs to a Paul Lamar. Works for Heath Chemical.
About the Brockton murder.
Not yet. Or Dembe.
You didn’t stop, did you, trying to find his real identity?
You found Reddington’s father?
Can I see it? Look, I know you were asking me not to pursue this, and if you’re pissed at me, I get it, but I felt like I had a right to know. My only regret is that I hit a dead end. ‘Cause that guy – he’s a ghost.
You could begin by saying hello to your granddaughter.
Mint.
You grow mint? I do the same thing at home so I can have it for my–
Thank you.
Can I ask why? You’re my grandfather. Why would you want to hide that from me?
A promise to lie to your granddaughter? [ CUP TAPS LIGHTLY ] Why would anyone ever ask you to do that?
You know his identity.
Who is he? And how is it connected to my mother? I know she didn’t drown in Cape May. I know that, 6 months later, she helped whoever’s pretending to be Reddington become Reddington. I have proof. What happened in those 6 months between the night the world thinks my mother drowned and the day Reddington came back from the dead? What happened?
But she wasn’t safe.
She was being hunted. There was a Russian – Anton Velov. He was searching for her.
A drive?
She got help.
While she made a plan.
By working with the Cabal.
Until what?
And my father? Did she love him, too?
So, you were her handler.
Which you ordered her to have.
And fought over me.
That’s what they were doing the night I shot him. Whoever’s impersonating Reddington, they had to know Reddington died that night. And if they knew that, they also knew that’s when my mother gave me up.
She was alone and scared and wanted me to be safe.
To you, right? She was going to see you in Moscow.
Wait. You told them?
I would have protected my child.
You did protect your child.
Your house in the woods.
You gave up everything – your country, your life. You walked away from it all to protect your daughter.
What did you do?
[ Softly ] Bye, Mama.
But how?
He’d need doctors, like Koehler –
– Someone who could change his face.
He’d need the details – the account numbers, the pass codes, the names of the contacts at the bank.
He’d need anecdotes to complete the story – some true, grounded in reality, some invented.
All the pieces were in place.
The letter.
And did you? [ SCOFFS LIGHTLY ]
But the letter you picked up in February–
Thank you for telling me.
You and my daughter – you’re the only family I have.
You are her great-grandfather. I expect you to spoil her rotten.
It isn’t the goose.
I know I said I wasn’t search–
Yeah.
If that’s the case, I’m sorry, but it’s gonna be okay. I know it will, especially because you’ve got nothing to disagree about anymore. I know you’re Ilya and the incredible thing you did to protect my mother, to protect me.
Dom. I know about him, too, that he’s my grandfather. I know everything – the facts, anyway. Of course, I have like a thousand questions.
And those can wait – all except for one. I know you became who you are to access Reddington’s accounts.
You know that?
I do. And it worked. But what I don’t understand is what happened after it worked. I mean, you became Reddington, but then, you stayed Reddington. And I don’t understand why.
[ SCOFFS ] I was so excited to tell you, I flew halfway around the world.
That depends. Is the goose really succulent?
Hey, stranger.
It’s been a week.
Okay, but the last time we spoke, it kind of changed everything, and I thought maybe we should talk about that.
Oh, you mean, “I am what I am, Popeye the Sailor Man”? Come on. I know you don’t want to talk about it, but you should. We should.
Because we’ve never been able to be completely honest with each other, and now we can.
No. Not until you tell me why you’re doing this. Are you upset?
About what?
So that’s what you’re conflicted about? Whether or not to kill me because I betrayed some “code”?
You forgave Dembe.
So where does that leave us?
Corinne Walker was abducted from a family arcade outside Minneapolis. 37 hours earlier, Nora Mitchell went missing from a park in Seattle.
Twins who aren’t twins.
Reddington isn’t sure, but according to the surveillance team he has following Anna McMahon, she’s connected to the abductions.
This photo was taken last week, and then this next one was taken yesterday outside the same arcade where Corinne Walker was abducted.
He doesn’t know, but he said he has a line or two in the water.
What do you mean?
What? No. I’m grateful. You did what you thought was best for me. I’m grateful for that.
Fingerprint and hospital records confirm they are different girls. Nora’s parents are just as desperate to find their daughter as you are.
There’s more. There’s something else. And this isn’t going to be easy for you to hear.
It isn’t just you. Neither you nor the Mitchells are biologically related to either of the girls.
So you did conceive through IVF?
Can you tell me the name of the IVF clinic you used?
Completely honest? [ INHALES SHARPLY ] No. Not yet.
The Walkers and the Mitchells, they were both clients?
And they shared the same doctor?
Meaning?
Like an embryo cultured off-site?
[ Loudly ] Miles Gordon, FBI! [ Knocks ] I’m not gonna ask again!
Mind if we ask you a few questions?
He seems to have it under control.
What I said earlier was true. I’m grateful that you’re a good friend. But, um, I’m also grateful for what you did, for telling me about my grandfather. [ WHISPERING ] I found him, and he told me about Reddington, about who he was.
His name was Ilya Koslov. He and Katarina were childhood friends, and then they were in the Cabal together.
After the fire, after I shot my father and the world was after Katarina, the only way for her to survive was to access the funds they used to frame Reddington.
Since he was already dead, Ilya Koslov brought him back to life.
I don’t know. To protect me somehow? To protect himself. Ilya Koslov and Katarina Rostova disappeared after betraying powerful people with long memories who were willing to kill to find out information about their whereabouts.
That’s why he’s keeping it a secret. That’s why we can’t tell anyone.
Whoever he was, he is Reddington. Cooper will understand that, but he might feel obliged to tell someone in the Bureau who doesn’t. Anna McMahon does not trust the Task Force, and she hates Reddington. She’s looking for any excuse to shut us down.
I’m pretty sure I had the right to know the truth, and I’m absolutely sure no one else does.
It’s because so many people died that I gave up my child. To protect Agnes until I learned the truth. Am I sure I know why he guarded his secret? No. Is it possible that I’m overlooking some of the holes in the story because there’s a sweetness to it? Yes, it’s possible. But it’s more possible that it’s true.
Ilya Koslov had motive and opportunity. If this were a crime, you’d say it was solved, and you’d believe you were right.
Grace Draxton. We’re here to take her into protective custody. FBI.
Call 9-1-1. Tell them a child has been abducted from your school.
The triplets they’re not the only ones who’ve been taken.
I went back into the database and found this – kids taken from Miami, Chicago, Dallas. There are more. Twins and triplets, all of them born to different parents, all of them reported missing in the last 18 months.
You said two girls had their DNA altered. What about the third?
Guillermo Rizal. Reddington says he’s the one responsible for the abductions.
No. Ressler’s working on that now.
Howard County.
He’s not alone. Three guards in the booth, two more at our six, and another watching from the west.
Our SWAT team is en route. Is this gonna be a problem?
Hey! Not a good idea. Put the gun down.
It’s okay. I’m with the police. We’re gonna get you out of here.
[ On phone ] Aram. Listen to me. We got kids at the Rizal property. A dozen. Maybe more. I need you to send a medic, protective services.
Copy that.
FBI! I’m gonna show you my credentials.
Last door on the left! There’s another agent down there!
That’s great. And the others?
If he knows anything, he hasn’t told me. Given how angry he is with me, I think I’d be the last to know.
Family? Is that what we are? I’m not so sure.
I’ve been thinking about it a lot recently, and, uh– I don’t think I know what “family” even means. [ VOICE BREAKING ] Before we had Agnes, I thought Tom and I were gonna adopt, that family had nothing to do with biology.
Thank you for coming.
I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said. About your code.
Did you find out who does?
If Mr. Cotton told you, then he told McMahon.
I have a code, too. I don’t kill people who violate it, but it’s every bit as important to my life as your code is to yours. Do you want to hear it?
Love wins.
You won’t stay angry with me. I know you think you will, but you won’t. Parents don’t stay angry with their children. Or their grandchildren. And that’s who you are to us. It doesn’t matter who you were. This is who you are and who you’ll always be.
Every day and twice on Sundays. Says so on the greeting card. When I was little, did you train me for everything you knew I’d have to face?
I want to know what you did for me so I can do the same thing for Agnes. To train her for everything I know she’ll have to face.
She won’t have to.
I left Agnes with Scottie because I was afraid of who you were. But I’m not anymore. Scottie won’t have to train Agnes. Because Agnes won’t be with her. I’m bringing her home.
The drive contains the dossier.
That’s what we all thought, but Reddington told me McMahon hired a finder to locate it for her.
Yes. After he told McMahon. Moreau slipped the drive into the backpack of a passing child named Parker Grimm.
Or they were taken.
Aram, are you getting this?
That’s it. That’s the drive.
Or maybe because an hour earlier this guy showed up on their doorstep.
No idea. He avoided the cameras.
You said they think they can’t trust us. If they’ve seen the dossier and it indicates the government’s involved, they think we’re looking for them on every CCTV monitor, surveillance feed, or private video the government has access to.
An insurance broker and his teacher wife and kid? Yeah, I think there’s a big chance they’re laying low in a motel room, scared to death right now.
Yeah, but I think I have a way to narrow it down.
[ HUSHED VOICE ] Reddington. [ LOUDER ] Reddington.
Rogelio. I need to talk to him.
[ WHISPERING ] The Grimms have the dossier. But they’re on the run with it. We need Rogelio to help us find them.
[ NORMAL VOICE ] Sometime this year would be good.
No. It isn’t. Will you just apologize?
We need his help.
Great. Let’s skip the kisses and hugs and get straight to business.
A husband, wife, and 11-year-old son. We think they’re holed up in a hotel room somewhere within a 60-mile radius of D.C.
[ On phone ] I know we were supposed to talk tonight, but I have to reschedule. I’ll call you later and figure out when.
I was supposed to meet with Scottie tonight and figure out a transition plan for me to bring Agnes home. The only reason I’m not with her is because I thought figuring out who you really were would put her in harm’s way. Now I know it won’t, but in trying to find out if you were the devil, I learned my mother was. That tape they played at your trial? She destroyed my father. She’s the reason he ran. I shot him, but she’s responsible for his death.
Because she’s dead? The Russians don’t seem to think so. When Ressler was trying to help me find out who you were, he went looking for her and was confronted by the KGB about what he found out. What if I bring Agnes back and they’re right – and she’s alive and she finds us?
And she’s more of a threat to Agnes than you ever were?
The manager confirmed. This is it.
Ressler! Hey! No! Stop!
We’re here to help.
Who’s Sam?
Was he able to read it?
Cooper. We have the Grimms.
Agents Keen and Ressler, FBI. What’s going on?
Who?
You saw him?
Jon! Do not get in that car!
I’m out! The supply case in the back! Can you get to it?!
I can’t get him!
I’m fine.
Where are you going?
Did you get ahold of Reddington? Please tell me he tracked down that fake Secret Service and got ahold of Grimm.
[ Answers ] Reddington.
If the people closest to the President have been corrupted, then the President’s life is in danger.
Okay, but where are you going?
This is good, right? We can still get to the drive before Sandquist.
They’re already on their way.
Meaning the dossier is not there. We still have a chance.
How is this even possible? Diaz? The highest office in the country?
But the President. Involved in a plot against America.
What about the carrier’s cell? Can you trace that?
So it tells us the direction he was headed in, not where he is.
We can’t wait.
[ To Jonathan ] Hang on. Hang on.
Hey. Hey. Shh. Don’t talk. We’ve got help on the way. Shh.
[ Pleading ] Listen to me. You hear my voice? Hang on. Stay with us. Hey! Stay with us.
[ Reads the folder name ] “The Princip Initiative.”
What are we looking at?
Himself?
You told us McMahon had nothing to do with them.
It doesn’t make any sense.
He’s not gonna kill himself.
But if the President supposedly wants this to happen, we can’t inform him or the Secret Service.
Please tell me this makes sense to you. The President conspiring to kill himself?
Are you talking about the President or my mother?
If there’s any risk –
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ] Thank you.
Sinusitis acting up again?
[ To Red ] Oh, my God. This can’t be good.
McMahon’s here with DHS agents.
They’re arresting everyone.
[ On phone ] I can’t just stand here – and not do something.
Reddington.
McMahon has them. Cooper, Ressler, and Aram. Everyone. She has her people sweeping the building looking for me. I need your help. I have an idea.
I am not leaving them.
I don’t think you get it. I am getting my team out of here. We are stopping the President from killing himself – and then I am going to the store for every princess pillow, comforter, backpack, toothbrush, and pajamas I can find so my apartment’s ready when Agnes gets home. Do you understand me?
Put me in touch with your friend. Uh, the kid whose mother hates you.
Yeah. Tadashi. That’s it. Have him call me.
How long do you think it’ll take Ruddiger to get here?
It isn’t just Ruddiger. He’s gonna need help.
Tadashi, it’s me. I found the Access Control System.
Tadashi, I promise you, I’m gonna make this up to you, but, right now, I need you to forget about that dance and walk me through this like your life depends on it.
Okay, in the war room on the upper deck, there should be a holding cell. It’s probably called holding T-6. Or maybe just Bay Six.
Port 18. I’ve got it.
Okay. What about interrogation on the B subfloor? C-2.
Interrogation C-1?
Okay, Tadashi. Stay with me. I’m gonna go fast, so pay attention. War room south corridor, south exit, R3.
Annex fire lane.
West mechanical room.
What? What is it?
Tadashi, one day you’re gonna write a book about how you skipped the school dance to prevent a conspiracy and save the President’s life, and then you’ll be in a league of your own. Now, do you remember what we talked about?
How do I activate it? 
Tadashi. The ultrasonic system.
[ On phone ] Hey. It’s me.
Yeah, they’re in the box, right where we want them.
Guys. Can you hear me, guys?
No. I bypassed the monitor relay. Aram, listen to me. I need your help. Reddington and I directed you to the box for a reason. If we can bypass the CCTV on our control server, piggyback the RSS – could someone remotely view our internal feed?
If they were capable?
He’s in. The war room’s blind. Reddington, you’re on.
[ On intercom ] Guys, hang tight. Reddington’s on site. Cavalry’s on its way.
Put your weapons down! Hands!
Show me your hands!
You are aware that we’re wanted fugitives.
And the sooner we execute it, the sooner I bring Agnes home.
It is.
Everyone seems to have a part to play. Except you.
More important than saving the President’s life?
Ready on your go.
We can’t hold the line!
We’ve got a problem. We need your help. Lock these doors and redirect any additional staff.
He’s the one you should be taking into custody! He’s the shooter! 
No one’s gonna believe we tried to assassinate the President.
That he tried to assassinate himself? ‘Cause that’s what he did.
Because that’s what happened! We’re being accused of trying to assassinate a man whose life we saved.
He didn’t do anything.
After we surprised him. That’s why he missed.
Okay, so the President wasn’t his target. Who was? I mean, think about it – an assassin goes to all the trouble to take a shot at a presidential debate, and his target isn’t the President? Does that make any sense to you?
Where are we?
Aram! Hold him down!
Gun.
Cover!
You have no play here.
And without the dossier, we can’t prove otherwise.
Then who was?
Who he would’ve killed if we hadn’t surprised him.
Ah, I feel anxious. I don’t know why.
Anxious isn’t really the right word. It’s more like heightened. Like, I can feel every breath. I’m not used to that.
Well, it’s only because I finally know. I know who you are. I know that you care. I know that I’m safe. I know that my mother cared.
Welcome home, Agnes.
Oh, I’ve missed you. Kat, hi.
You’re not gonna stay for dinner?
[ CHUCKLES ] It’s a long story. But we finally have time to tell it.
Hey, do you want a lemon bar?
Yeah? Who is your top choice? Mrs. Doubtfire, right?
What about “Hand That Rocks the Cradle”?
“The Manny”?
Well– I have more than that.
[ SIGHING ] Are they all bad?
Is it just me, or does it seem like everyone has a skeleton in the closet? [ CLICKS TONGUE ]
Well, I need to keep looking. Mrs. Williams is helping me out as a favor. I need someone who’s permanent.
This is Keen.
Gone where?
Tell me what you know.
When?
With who?
How do you know you can trust him if you don’t know who he is?
He went without you? Why would he do that?
[ On phone ] I talked to Morgan. He hasn’t heard from him. Can you reach out to Chuck?
We don’t.
He wasn’t caught last year.
He was arrested, but he wasn’t caught.
I turned him in.
So he couldn’t get in the way of me trying to find out his real identity.
They deserve to know.
That the real Raymond Reddington died in 1991 and the man you know as Reddington was once a KGB agent named Ilya Koslov.
It’s a long story. And I’ll tell it to you after we get him back.
It doesn’t matter who he was. I thought it did, but it doesn’t. And once you hear the story, I don’t think it’ll matter to you. The only thing that matters is that Reddington – our Reddington – is in French custody, and we have to get him back.
The real one.
When I was 4, yeah.
Pretty much.
But the attaché, Briaux, you said he was cooperative.
Keen.
Did you talk to Briaux?
He was just lingering outside, chatting up the guards, waiting for you to arrive.
Well, if Reddington isn’t being held by the French police, who is holding him?
Whoever it was must’ve known we were in the dark and reached out anyway, had Briaux come to meet you. Why? What were they hoping to gain?
Briaux’s real name is Michael Hansen. Lives off Vermont and North Crescent. High-end grifter who stings anyone from Vegas big shots to tech VCs.
No, he isn’t. Neither am I.
[ Jauntily ] A man I’ve grown to like.
FBI!
Where’s Reddington?!
Then you’re gonna tell us who does.
Louis T. Steinhil?
That name’s what, an alias?
How does he operate?
Tell us about it, this reputation.
A French cop.
You said he pays well.
How? Cash? Wire transfer?
Hansen couldn’t lead us to The Illusionist, but there’s a chance his money can. Aram’s tracing it now, and I’m hunting for childcare. Turns out Steinhil isn’t the only one who isn’t who he appears to be.
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you before.
You think that’s where they’re holding Reddington.
I do have an answer to your question, by the way.
[ On phone ] Aram, text me that address and notify the FBI in Annapolis.
Not yet. I don’t want to scramble units that might expose Reddington until we know what we’re dealing with.
We’re too late.
We know you all worked for Steinhil.
We know the hospital is fake.
So Reddington isn’t paralyzed.
But you know what she wanted Reddington to talk about?
Do you know her name?
[ Whispers ] Katarina Rostova.
This is who my mother is to me – an aura that surrounds me. For better or for worse, I don’t know.
They’re in there asking them about her.
Whoever took him, it’s because of her.
You don’t know that.
I didn’t tell you because you’re honest. You’d want to report Reddington’s misrepresentation to Main Justice. And I don’t think you should.
Because he’s not my father.
When I thought he was my father, I hated him for abandoning me.
I thought he shirked responsibility. But now I know he takes it on even when he doesn’t have to.
I was nobody to him. The illegitimate daughter of a childhood friend.
And he devoted half his life to me. Do you know anyone else who does that? 
Because I don’t.
[ Jauntily, walking off ] A man I’ve grown to like.
We questioned everyone who worked the con.
Just why she did it to ask what he knows about my mother.
Something or someone. Katarina Rostova.
Maybe that’s what she wanted us to think.
Apparently, she’s not the maternal type.
I brought Agnes home thinking my mother wasn’t a threat. Now I’m not sure.
We, um– That is, are you okay?
We’re here to see Margaret Teague.
Illusions. Cons. People pretending to be something they’re not.
Or my mother.
But if she isn’t who I thought she was, if she’s a threat–
We?
Agents Keen and Ressler. We’re looking for Louis Steinhil.
I don’t care if you know or not. I’m looking for someone I care about, and in order to find that person, I got to find Steinhil. So lets cut to the chase. What you provide, does he pick up, or do you deliver?
To where? 
He was here.
They tricked him, made him think he escaped.
He was being tracked. They both were.
One of the security guards said there was a nurse on site who befriended him, made Reddington think she was on his side. She orchestrated the escape.
My grandfather’s house.
Whoever took Reddington was trying to find out about Katarina Rostova. If he wouldn’t tell them, maybe they think Dom will. And if they do to him what they did to Reddington–
They may already be there.
Ressler, in here! Dom? Dom, it’s Elizabeth Keen. Are you okay?
It’s clear!
The nearest hospital’s in the opposite direction.
Then why are we going the wrong way?
What? What? I’m sorry, but who are you?
What if he dies before then?
[ Whispers ] Please don’t tell me she’s the nurse from the French hospital.
She was in on the con.
What’s happening?!
[ Whispering ] Those questions you don’t want asked, well, I’m gonna ask them anyway. Why don’t we start with who did this.
[ Urgent whisper ] Yes, now. Someone out there thinks Katarina Rostova is still alive, and clearly they think you know more than you’re saying.
Who grabbed you in Paris? Who tortured you? Why is my grandfather dying in a lumberyard? My question is, what the hell happened?
Excuse me?
He’s not wrong.
None of this would’ve happened if Ressler and I hadn’t started asking a lot of questions he told us not to ask.
Have you decided whether to tell Main Justice?
Reddington wouldn’t tell us who abducted him. And it’s not like we can ask Steinhil or whatever his real name was.
You think that’s really necessary?
I’m sorry my family is so — messy.
I didn’t realize you two were close.
I’m sorry my questions caused all this. But they are questions I deserve answers to. Maybe not now. Now it’s too dangerous. But someday I’m going to insist on answers. And you’re going to have to give them to me.
Shoes, shoes, shoes! If we don’t leave here in two minutes, Agnes, you’re definitely gonna be late for the bell.
Ears or no ears?
Uh, hello. I’m Liz. This is Agnes.
It’s funny. Mrs. Monzewski’s lived there forever. I didn’t know she was thinking of moving.
We have to run, but it was nice meeting you.
[ SIGHS ] Shoot.
Oh, no, that’s okay. I got it.
No thanks. I got it.
Oh, do you want some coffee?
Come on. I insist.
So happy we finally get a chance to chat.
Yeah, I just dropped her off, and, uh, I was on my way home and realized I didn’t have anything for dinner, so I picked up a few things.
I’m a government employee. What about you?
Agnes is in full-on princess mode.
I know it’s not very woke, but she’s irresistible.
Oh, and I love a fairytale. Just not the part where you got to get saved by Prince Charming.
Um – that’s work. I’m so sorry. I got to go. Have you seen my keys? I could’ve sworn I just put them right here.
Uh, keep the mug. Bring it back later. I’m really sorry about this.
How’s my grandfather?
And the woman who tried to kill him?
The woman.
You said you had a lead.
Poetry lovers?
And this connects to the woman who abducted you in Paris?
According to Reddington, Les Fleurs du Mal is our best chance of finding Steinhil. Because whoever runs it contracted him to create an illusion.
A name. Charles Radcliffe. According to Reddington, he attended one of the society’s events.
Uh – amazing. She’s sweetly oblivious to the guards you have sitting outside our apartment to protect her.
s that why you sent Aram instead of me?
I don’t. But it’s good to know I can. Thank you – for everything.
Which means you and Aram will be on your own.
You’re going to wear the device into the building in pieces.
he other society members don’t share your enthusiasm. They’re too busy turning on you. So far, they’ve detailed six murders.
s that what you gave Vance Palmer when you locked him in a box with a bomb he couldn’t defuse?
Not quite. Louis Steinhil. I’m told you hired him once.
Steinhil. Louis T. It’s an anagram for The Illusionist.
Oh, hey, sorry about that. Um– Give me one second.
So, I was just calling to tell you I got what you wanted. An address on Steinhil.
Hmm.
Some people are so thoughtful.
How did it happen? 
You becoming estranged from your daughter.
I was estranged from my mother.
I would hope that she would want to make amends with me, too.
Well I hope it happens.
Ohh.
Well, what do you think – great, right?
Yeah, all her references raved about her. We’re meeting this afternoon, but I have a good feeling about her.
Which is a huge relief. I mean, it’s impossible to find someone great.
Have you reached out to her yet – to your daughter?
You should just do it.
Have you noticed the men parked across the street every day? Every night?
They’re there for my protection.
My mother.
Just trust me. Whatever pushed you and your daughter apart, it’s nothing compared to what me and my mother have gone through. Just call her. I’m sure she’d appreciate it.
It doesn’t matter. She’s not going to.
She won’t. My mother isn’t like you. You want a relationship with your daughter. She doesn’t.
Hey. What’s going on?
I think so, too.
And risk having them shut us down?
But does it really matter who he is? To the job we’re doing, I mean.
It will to them.
Yeah. I, uh, wanted this afternoon off. I found a nanny. Well, I-I think I did. I’m meeting with her this afternoon.
About Reddington. Have you already reached out to Main Justice?
What’s odd about it?
I can work pretty crazy hours.
Some weekends, some traveling.
I spoke to some of your references. Is it true that you watched their kids and cooked?
Oh, good, ’cause on my best day, the best I can do is peanut butter and jelly and tuna fish.
You have no idea how much I need that. How much Agnes needs it.
Great. When can you start? 
Anything?
This is about the SIPRNet cable. Daniel Hutton.
They could start back-channel negotiations.
[ On phone ] By text, not by phone. She quit via text.
I know. I thought she was perfect.
Well, that’s why I’m calling. I am stuck at work, and Agnes is gonna be home soon.
I’m so sorry about this.
Really? Are you sure?
Thank you. You’re a lifesaver. I don’t know what happened.
Daniel Hutton. The SIPRNet cable told you he was still alive.
That’s awful. Were you two close?
[ Quietly ] Is your mind made up about what you’re gonna tell her about Reddington’s identity?
I’d say – definitely not.
I love it. More importantly, Agnes loves it.
You really saved me today.
I still can’t believe Denora bailed on me like that.
I think I’ll be counting on you a lot.
The man we’re looking for is Norman Devane.
We all know Devane as the mastermind behind the Libyan bioweapons program, but Reddington says that represents just a single line in a very lengthy resume. In Reddington’s world, Devane is known as a killer for hire. Simon Vestergaard was a shipping magnate who died of liver cancer. Senator Jessica Tandler died of drug-resistant pneumonia. And Ronald Perchik was a federal judge who suffered a deadly stroke two days after receiving a shingles vaccine.
Both. And according to Reddington, Devane is in the U.S. and active.
No, he kills people by making them sick by giving them cancer or pneumonia or some other deadly disease.
The world believed these three died of natural causes, but Reddington says they were murdered.
Apparently.
He doesn’t know.
Elodie Radcliffe? The woman whose husband is in a wheelchair?
I think it’s great.
I think it’s great you slept with anyone. I appreciate that she’s taking care of her husband. But she needs a life, too. And so do you.
You hit him with a drone strike outside Damascus.
But you traced a payment he made to an Anatole Kuragin. Who’s he?
Do you know where we could find him?
I know someone who can.
He wants to, but it’s been two weeks.
Lying? That’s your advice on how to start a relationship?
Are you telling me Devane hired a hacker to access the medical records of 100 million people just so he could sequence one teenager’s genes?
Why? What makes them special? 
We don’t know, but of the 20 kids he sequenced, five developed life-threatening cancers or infections. Three died. Two recovered.
Not to mention how any of this connects to the woman who abducted Reddington in Paris.
I can’t imagine how hard that must have been. On all of you.
How long has Ben been in remission?
Do you have any enemies? Someone who might have hurt Ben to get to you?
Boarding school?
What was the name of the school? 
No, but they all went to boarding school there. Abbott Boarding School.
Sounds like gene sequencing was the final part of some sort of entrance exam. Every student that passed wound up at the school.
More importantly, we have reason to believe Howard Keller is in danger.
Hey, you! Yeah, you. You want to go to jail for obstruction of justice, too? Or are you gonna show me to Howard Keller’s room?
Howard Keller?
Where is he?
Hey. Hey!
He’s been sedated. Lock down the school! Now!
Call an ambulance! Flip him for me.
Howard! Howard. Talk to me. Can you hear me? I need you to talk to me. The man who did this – do you know where he went? Talk to me, Howard! Do you know where he went?! 
Yes, and he’s still infecting people. Only now the people he’s infecting are children at a boarding school.
There was a fight. He was injected with the disease he gave one of the students some sort of flesh-eating bacteria. Ressler’s taking him to the hospital.
I don’t know. Some died. Some made miraculous recoveries. We’re taking one to Children of Mercy now.
No, he’s taking Devane to Walter Reed.
Devane cured the headmaster’s son. He had a terminal illness, and somehow Devane put it in remission.
Devane agreed to continue treatment on the headmaster’s son if he agreed to allow him to experiment on the students at the school.
To test his treatments. He gave Howard immunotherapy that he designed for himself.
No. They weren’t.
Constance Drucker?
And Reddington thinks Masuda can lead him back to her.
So we can get to the woman who might have answers about my mother. But I don’t think I want them. We went after Katarina, and my grandfather nearly died.
Yeah, but I don’t need to. I’m happy. I’ve got Agnes back. I’m not gonna risk that to hunt for answers about a woman I’ve never really known. It isn’t worth it.
I-I meant to ask. What was Reddington doing with Stark?
I spoke to Cooper. He wants to bring Agent Park onto the Task Force.
I did. After vetting a lot of candidates. She’s a good fit.
Of course you do. It wasn’t your decision.
She’s a combat medic, not an agent.
Please just consider Park. I know she seems straight-laced, but deep down, I feel there’s a darkness there you’ll appreciate. [ CHUCKLES ]
Oh, yeah, the bombing. Scary stuff. It’s hard to believe someone of Dr. Alexander’s reputation would do something like–
He uploaded a confession video before he went to work.
What makes you think he’s innocent?
Hey, there, Tadashi. Good to see you, too.
The video’s a fake?
They rearranged his words? Edited the footage to–
What about that last part? Th-The one with the suicide vest?
A fake video triggered police response in Phoenix to a shooting that never happened. Doctored footage of a Silicon Valley tech firm caused stock prices to crater. And a U.S. senator lost her seat after photos of an affair that never happened went viral on social media. Three deepfakes, three examples of malicious hoaxes that led to real-life consequences. And according to Reddington, the shooting death of Dr. Alexander is simply the most recent.
Yes. By all accounts, Dr. Alexander was a highly respected systems engineer. Happy marriage, healthy children, successful career. At DXE Labs, he designed an on board intelligence system for a new generation of battlefield drones.
[ On phone ] Hey, it’s me. Got a minute?
Why? Where are you?
[ CHUCKLING ] Okay. That’s great, but the apple brown betty is gonna have to wait. I spoke to Park. She has a lead.
She said the computer used to upload the deepfake also made another transaction.
Nope, money. $70,000 to be exact. Wired to a Walter Higgins.
Total dead end. But we got an image of him on the CCTVs withdrawing the payment. Park is releasing it on the wire, but I want you to take a look. Thought maybe you’d know the face.
Reddington says he has a lead.
Alina, I want this to work. And in order for that to happen, you have to try to make a good impression.
[ SIGHS ]
It’s complicated.
I vetted you, and I think you’re the right person for the job.
Anchorage.
No, I don’t. And no one will tell me.
You have a secret. That tells me a lot more about you than your GPA.
And I won’t ask. But if you want this job, at least try to make a good impression.
What happened?!
You wanted her to see all this.
Ressler, it’s me. We got to find a scientist, works for Almacorp, named Tracy Long.
Yes.
We don’t know.
I said we gathered intel from him. He was never in our custody.
Did you have a meeting in Arlington this morning?
Why? Tell us about him.
The reason I’m asking is because we believe the attempt on your life was meant to happen in Arlington.
Monitored? How?
Mr. Quentin, this is Agent Elizabeth Keen with the FBI.
We have reliable intel your network’s been breached. We think your emergency system and EVAC protocols have been compromised and that a physical threat is imminent.
We don’t know yet.
How many people are still down here?
How many?
We’ve got Fire and Paramedics on site, but they can’t access the hot spots. They’re locked out.
Is there anything I can say to change your mind?
[ CHUCKLES ] I’m not sure it’s healthy for any of us.
I’m sorry you feel that way.
I thought you said you were telling Reddington you’re out.
That’s not what he said. He said he wants you. Whatever you said or did, he really wants you. Did you hear what I said? The job’s yours if you want it.
Okay. Uh, what is it?
You only have to watch Agnes until 3:00 today, and then she has a play date with her friend Shelly. Thanks again for all your help.
So, what’s the plan today?
[ LAUGHS ] You’ve got to be kidding me.
I’ll pass, and I’ll say a little prayer for your digestive tract.
You know, I never took you for a camper.
Your life is so weird.
I’m relieved. The FBI has been looking for him since he disappeared three months ago. We thought he was dead.
The Bureau believes the Cironato crime family had him abducted because he was planning to oppose a casino bill they favored.
Is plotting? The governor’s back. It’s over.
The abduction was categorized as an act of terror.
A governor is abducted. No demands are made for his return, no blackmail, no ransom.
I know it’s hard to believe, but the world really is a safer place because of what he does.
Told you what?
Alina, your secret’s safe with me.
Nothing at all?
And that’s where you were the day of your disappearance?
Hmm. Almost three months? It’s a long time to keep a man comatose. I’m surprised you can even walk.
But the bank across the street erases its footage annually, and they had this.
The van was registered to a Wendell Willis.
No. Willis works freelance I.T. in Virginia. But get this — there is no Speedy Linen Supplies. We think he put a fake decal on his van.
Hi, honey. Are your parents home?
Okay, can we talk to her?
We have reason to believe this property contains evidence of a crime. Do you live with a Wendell Willis?
Thanks. We’ll let you know if we need anything else.
Thank you.
[ Light-heartedly ] You hated me when we first met.
Well, I think Park feels the same way.
[ CHUCKLING ] Thanks a lot.
Check it out.
Who’s he?
[ On phone ] Aram, you and Park need to get out to Robson Research. We know who our next victim is.
Wendell Willis was a recently hired volunteer at Robson Research. I sent Aram and Park to apprehend him, but they were too late.
This is Willis’ van leaving the parking structure just before they arrived.
You said the victims were unrelated, but that’s not entirely true. A victim profile reveals they have a lot in common powerful men, socially conservative, politically active.
He went missing for two months last year, resurfaced in the middle of a massive manhunt, said he’d gone on an unannounced spiritual retreat, and apologized for alarming anyone.
That’s why he isn’t talking.
That makes sense.
It’s Hannah Hayes. Made headlines seven years ago while she was a surgical resident and was raped on campus. It resulted in a pregnancy.
You were right. I should have told you. About my relationship to Reddington. You’re a part of the team now, and you deserved to know. I’m sorry. It was an oversight. But your secret is safe with me. In fact, I’m gonna share a secret of my own. Reddington is my father. Or he was.
He’s a former KGB agent.
What are you coloring?
So, I was thinking, tomorrow we could have breakfast at Camel’s Cafe and then maybe go to the zoo. What do you think of that?
If the pandas are awake, we can see the pandas. Do you think they’ll be awake?
Ah. Maddy, hey, you’re up and at ’em early.
Oh, no. Is everything okay?
If this is about Agnes–
No, go be with your friend. Don’t think twice about it, Maddy. I’ll call Beth. I’m sure she can cover. Have fun with your friend. He’s single, I hope.
We’ll be fine. Have fun.
[ To Agnes ] Hey, kiddo. Go pack your bags. You’re gonna have a play date with Shelly.
[ Answers phone ] Reddington, what’s up?
What is it? Is something wrong?
Hawala – It’s an Arabic word that essentially means “money transfer without money movement.” Since 9/11, the hawala system has been a focus of the Bureau. But according to Reddington, his newest Blacklister has taken the traditional legal method to a whole new illegal level.
It’s a banking system outside of banks.
It’s an IOU system.
Which brings me to our suspect Bhavish Ratna, 60, Indian national with no priors.
Last address Jackson Heights, Queens. If the traditional model is an informal association between brokers, Ratna just formalized it. 34 offices in 18 countries, all moving cash for terrorists, human traffickers, drug cartels – the worst of the worst. All run by one man, all with the same front to the public restaurants.
According to Reddington, these restaurants have different names but are connected financially and all headquartered in Manhattan.
He thinks the woman who took him in Paris used Ratna to pay for intel. He hopes that Ratna will help him find her.
[ On comms ] Bhavish Ratna – married, bought the restaurant 23 years ago with his wife. Taxes paid, not once late on rent.
There’s the delivery guy again.
That’s him – Ratna.
He’s not taking the bike. He’s walking from here.
Copy that. I have eyes.
Guys, I think we have a situation here.
The construction worker behind Ratna – he’s on radio. I don’t like this. He’s got protection.
Ressler, what’s going on?
He’s not with us.
I don’t know. He’s got security everywhere.
Ressler, they’re armed.
Drop your weapon! Drop your weapon.
FBI! Stop! Watch out.
You heard the man. Put the gun down.
Hello?
Yeah, Beth. What’s going on? How are the girls?
What’s wrong? Everything okay?
What did she draw?
What do you mean, a dead man? Did she say–
The dead man?
Yes, no, of course.
I don’t know– You know what? She walked in on me while I was watching TV. A terrible show.
Okay, thank you, Beth.
Did you find something?
Atticus isn’t gonna go after someone who’s already in prison.
We lost Yang. Atticus’ men got here first. Most of the protective detail is dead.
You don’t buy it?
So, maybe Yang wasn’t just a foot soldier.
Maybe Zhao couldn’t afford to have him talk to the police. Maybe he was worried Yang would flip.
That sounds reasonable.
Because Yang knew something, and Zhao needed to know what it was.
Because Yang’s an informant. Or worse. Oh, my God. That’s it.
Were you gonna tell us?
Agent Keen. I’m part of the task force who tried to warn you this was gonna happen. He’s one of yours, isn’t he, Alfred Yang? He’s an agent.
How long has he been undercover? The Zhaos didn’t do this to rescue one of their soldiers. They did this to eliminate an undercover cop who could have destroyed them.
I have a source. Apparently, so does Zhao. How long?
Not anymore.
Listen to me. They’re gonna kill him. If we don’t find a way to track wherever they took him, they are going to kill him.
Hey, you okay?
Call an ambulance.
[ To Agnes ] Come here. Give me a hug. I haven’t seen you all day. Hey. Can I ask you something about the, uh– the picture you drew today?
The man in the picture – is he someone you saw?
Is it something you want to talk to me about? Honey, Agnes, look at me. You’re not in trouble, honey. I’m just curious where you got the idea.
With Miss Tolliver?
Hi. How’s your friend?
Actually, that’s what I wanted to see you about. Uh, is now a bad time?
Great. Okay.
She wouldn’t just make that up.
So, she didn’t say anything to you? Nothing at all?
Uh, I didn’t realize we had secrets.
Well, what does that have to do with–
What I do does scare her, and we talk about that.
This is not a fairy tale.
[ Defensively ] I’m not being defensive. I’m defending my daughter.
Come on, munchkin! Hurry! The Saltmans are waiting! Again.
[ SIGHS ]
Punctuality is not her strong suit yet, but she could write a book on transitional objects.
I mean, she won’t go anywhere without it.
I’m gonna see her off, but I’ll be back in a sec if you want to come by for coffee.
Perfect timing!
Coffee. I was, uh– Sorry. I was expecting someone else.
You said she’s after certain information. Does he have it?
Who is she – the woman in Paris? You still haven’t told me her name.
I deserve to know. She’s going after the people you care about. She’s hurting your friend. If she can hurt him, she can hurt us.
 This company – Orion Relocation Service – tell me about them.
Until now, Reddington’s heard whispers, ghost stories about the people who helped the worst of the worst disappear – assassins, traitors, the woman who abducted him in Paris.
And arrest a company of murderers. Orion doesn’t just give their clients fake IDs. They kill innocent people and give their identities to their clients.
“Orion” is a DBA, a financial shell he can’t crack. What he does have is a name, one of Orion’s clients, a thief looking for a new identity – Sofia Burke.
Okay. [ SIGHS ] Agnes said she saw a dead body in the park the other day.
Yeah. S-She was pretty shaken up. Her nanny didn’t see anything, but there was a birthday party in the park, and the Park Department gave me the name of the family who rented the field.
The mom did, but she was too freaked out to make a positive ID. So I’m hoping I can get one from the video of the birthday party here.
He’s carrying.
No, but I’m gonna find out.
Aram says no. I’ve circulated the image to every FBI office worldwide to see if anyone can ID the man.
We can’t know until we find Burke. Did her partner give us a lead?
Then so am I. If he can lead us toward anyone involved in sending those men after my kid, I want to hear it first.
I’m only interested in finding Burke’s fence.
Who’s that?
As well as an art lover. I understand you dabble in art yourself.
Is this for real?
Is annoyance a sense?
We want her to try again. You can get in touch with her. We can’t.
[ WHISPERING ] Endangered?
She’s late.
I’m expecting a call.
Excuse me.
[ On phone ] Hello?
Yes, I was expecting your call. I understand you identified the man in the photo I circulated.
[ On phone ] And this Tommy Petrov. You’re sure he’s Russian mafia?
“Answered”?
I was hoping you did. [ SIGHS ]
Motya Morozov. Does he work with the woman in Paris?
Was he looking for my mother?
[ Insistently ] The woman in Paris. If you won’t tell me her name, just tell me this. If we find her, will it end?
You said you had a lead? 
I should move.
My family’s being stalked by the Russian mob.
Hi. Is there any chance you could look after Agnes today?
What Agnes said, there was a dead body in the park.
There were men with guns.
They were there for her. To hurt her.
I can’t explain everything. I just need someone I trust to look after her until I get home.
I’m sorry to pull you out of a meeting.
Honestly, I don’t know what I’d do without you.
[ On phone ] Did you get ahold of Denise?
Why would you be calling him?
He’s not keeping this from me.
If you had gotten her location, would you have shared it with me?
Who is she? The woman in Paris. I want a name.
Who is she?!
We have the Orion files in the War Room.
We have the files, but you know who we’re looking for.  We can’t find her without you. And with Bisset dead and the files in our possession, you can’t find her without us.
Are you keeping the owl?
Come to the War Room. We’ll go through the files together, you ID her, and we’ll save your friend.
My nanny.
[ To herself ] Of course it’s her.
No. Nothing. It’s just, uh– lost track of time. My nanny has to go.
 Wouldn’t make any difference. She’s really got to go.
[ WHISPERING ] How’s Agnes?
I’ll tell you in a minute. I just want to check in on her first.
They weren’t interested in her.
They were interested in you.
 You said you were here to reconnect with your daughter.
That Agnes reminded you of your granddaughter. The men went to the park to kill you, and you killed one of them first.
Not Maddy Tolliver. No. Maddy Tolliver was a s-sweet, unassuming woman you had murdered so you could steal her identity.
Maddy Tolliver would never kill anyone. But Katarina Rostova would. Katarina Rostova’s a natural born killer. Of enemies, friends, family.
I knew it. [ CHUCKLES ] A part of me knew who you were. I just didn’t want to admit it because I knew it would have to end this way.
You shot your father. You put your granddaughter in harm’s way. You lied your way into my life. You’ve caused pain and suffering for everyone I’ve ever cared about. Give me one good reason I shouldn’t end this right now.
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]
[ Pointing gun ] You shot your father. You put your granddaughter in harm’s way. You lied your way into my life. You’ve caused pain and suffering for everyone I’ve ever cared about. Give me one good reason I shouldn’t end this right now.
A mother protects her children.
By leaving me?
And how about moving in next door and not telling me who you really are? I suppose you did that to protect me, too.
Why are you here?
Tell me. After all this time, why are you here?
Why now?
So you came here? Why? Did you think I could stop them?
I want the truth.
I know who Ilya Koslov is and that you didn’t need my help to find him.
Where’s Agnes?
Hi, Beth. It’s me. Can I talk to Agnes for a sec?
[ SIGHS ] Hi, honey. How are you? — Chocolate-chip pancakes? Well, I wouldn’t want to interrupt that. I just wanted to say I love you. Okay? — Bye.
I don’t believe you’re afraid of anything.
You say you need me to find Ilya Koslov, but I know that that’s not true. You had him in Paris.
I know who Reddington really is. He told me.
He’s the real Koslov, and he turned into Reddington 30 years ago to help you escape.
Well, Dom did, and Reddington, he confirmed it. He saved your life. And you repaid him by torturing him within an inch of his.
No. You don’t understand. He may not be my father, but Reddington, this Reddington, has watched over me my entire life. You say you want to get to know each other– To be a family? Well, he’s a part of that family. And if you can’t be on his side, I can’t be on yours.
I don’t think there’s anything you can say that would convince me of that.
This man, I’ve met him before. He’s friends with Reddington. F-F-Frank –
That file doesn’t prove anything. Why should I trust you?
If Reddington isn’t Koslov, then who is he?
How could you not know? Ilya’s your friend.
That isn’t what Dom told me.
Why would he do that?
You’re his child. Who could he care about more than you? — No. [ SCOFFS ] That can’t be true.
My grandfather tried to kill you to protect me.
Until they found you again. The Townsend Directive.
No, they didn’t. I did. I’m the reason they’re after you again. I went looking for you. They found out. They followed my lead.
[ Crying ] Of course I was. You’re my mother.
[ SIGHS ]
What is it? The Townsend Directive?
Can it be called off?
I’m fine.
I had an issue with Agnes, but it’s fine now. I-I found something while I was out. Thought it was a lead, so I chased after it.
Yeah, but it didn’t go anywhere. Now I’m stuck in traffic, on the way back from–
Uh, at a friend’s. Why?
What? Maddy Tolliver? Are you sure?
Have you sent a team?
They’re on their way. They’ve probably already set a perimeter.
If you stay and try to find them, you will be caught.
What are you gonna do?
[ Turns around, SIGHS ] What if I can get you out? 
I’ll get you out.
You got to leave Ilya.
If you want me to get you out of here alive, you’ve got to leave him. And we got to go now.
My husband, Tom, and I specifically chose this apartment because you can access the service corridor from the parking structure.
Only to the back of the building, but – and don’t tell the super – I may have opened a small access to the city’s underground utility chase. That runs for blocks.
All of us together? That’s too conspicuous. This way, if we get caught, only two of us get busted.
Go. Now. Go. This door leads to the street. You get a car. I’m gonna double back, try and stall them.
[ SOFTLY ] Go.
I came here as fast as I could. What’d you find?
Wait. Reddington’s friend?
Yeah, of course. We’ll send out a description, put out a BOLO.
Her name?
Yeah.
Maddy. Maddy Tolliver.
You have nothing to apologize for.
No, it’s not.
Yes.
She isn’t who I thought she was. The reason she moved in next to me – she’s looking for answers that could save her life.
No, but I hope she does.
Reddington’s.
That’s indefensible. And if she did it, I’ll walk her into prison myself. But I’m not on Reddington’s side or her side. I’m on the side of the truth.  And right now Reddington’s hiding that from me, and my mother isn’t.
I met my mother.
I know you didn’t want me to. But I did. She told me you lied to me about who Reddington really is. I don’t understand why you did that or why you’d try to have her killed to protect me.
You tried to kill your own child.
What kind of person would do something like that? 
[ Quietly ] I can’t figure it out. But maybe she can. Maybe she can find out everything you’re trying to hide from me.
What is?
W-What? 
How?
How do you know?
She is.
[ SNIFFLES ]
Hello?
Katarina?
What happened? What’s going on?
[ LAUGHS SOFTLY ] Like a charm.
Of course I can. I’m a Rostova.
Be safe.
[ To Dom ] I met my mother. I know you didn’t want me to. But I did. She told me you lied to me about who Reddington really is. I don’t understand why you did that or why you’d try to have her killed to protect me. You tried to kill your own child. What kind of person would do something like that? I can’t figure it out. But maybe she can. Maybe she can find out everything you’re trying to hide from me.
Hey.
Ohh, boy. What’d you do this time?
Ressler–
Ressler. She isn’t dead.
She staged that for Reddington’s benefit.
But they’re gonna come back unless she finds another way to protect herself. And until she does, we can’t tell anyone she’s alive.
Not to me, and I don’t want to admit it to him. He must know it’s what I’m thinking.
[ Sighing ] I don’t know.
Sleeping Beauty. She’s a lilac fairy.
You danced? In tights?
Well, that’s an image I’ll never be able to forget.
[ Answers phone ] Hi.
Can I ask you a question?
Was the woman from Paris my mother?
Was it her?
Tell me about the caskets.
The casket you stole had already been stolen?
So you want us to find whoever’s responsible so you can get your casket back.
Reddington actually underestimated the problem here. It turns out that up to 20% of the art-and-antiquities market is made up of forgeries. That’s almost $10 billion worth of counterfeits being passed off as real to governments, museums, and individuals.
Reddington and his pals lifted the caskets from the Olympian Gallery.
He thinks that if the person we’re looking for was able to forge one piece of art there, he forged others.
With a self-portrait by Judith Leyster. He thinks it’s a fake.
He did?
That’s what he, uh– He told you about Agnes’ ballet.
All right. 
Using a spectrometer, they were able to detect trace amounts of a synthetic pigment that was invented centuries after Leyster died.
Yes, and the painting was everything it should be.
As far as we can tell, that’s the only time they were blind.
From before and after. Park is reviewing them now.
You know, there are easier ways to get more fiber in your diet.
I’m so sorry. That’s terrible.
Yes, of course.
Aram, we’ve talked about this. It’s a very complicated situation.
Yeah, we already knew that.
And we have motive.
The counterfeit Leyster? The real one belonged to the Fenbergs. So did Red’s nesting casket.
Not yet, but we will.
Yes, we are.
The work you acquired was real. The forgeries came later.
He may, but we don’t know where he is.
Bank statements show Vitaris is deep in debt. He’s gonna need to make another score soon.
That painting is hanging in their house. We just saw it.
Ms. Fenberg, this is Agent Keen. I’m calling to let you know we’re sending units to your house.
It’s Vitaris. He’s still at large, but items in his home indicate that he might be targeting you and your family directly.
We’re not sure. That’s why we’re sending units. All we know is Vitaris is angry and has a vendetta, and we don’t want him to act on it. We’ll be there soon. We’ll talk more when we’re on-site.
Help me gather these movers. The Art Crimes Unit is en route. I don’t want any of this leaving here without them cataloguing it.
Hey. You. Vitaris.
Ressler!
Hey! Stop! 
Stop! Stop.
Then put the gun down, Richard. 
It’s over. You’re under arrest.
We know, Richard. We’re sorry. But hurting someone else isn’t gonna bring him back. Put the gun down. 
It’s exquisite because of what you know about it, where it came from, who made it. It’s intellectual. I like art that’s more emotional.
The forger – The one you found and won’t turn over to us.
It wasn’t just my desire.
She did. And it’s difficult for me to believe she wasn’t.
Is that why you gave us this case? To show me how easy it is to mistake something that’s fake for something that’s real?
You got it just so you could sell it?
Uh, you can just let me out here at the end of the block. Uh, wherever you’re going, I’d like you to be back in time–
Harold told you?
You guys!
Right? Wasn’t it so cute.
Hey! Ohh, hi, Agnes.
I didn’t think you’d made it.
And you brought a friend. If you have plans–
Thank you, by the way, for the intel on the Turkish agents. You know, you were right when you recently told me that, um, it’s been difficult since Tom, but that I have Agnes, and I should be looking forward and not back.
[ Sighs ] I agree. I do. But so do you.
That makes two of us.
Thanks again for coming. It means a lot.
Hey.
We may not have bigger lives, but we have each other.
… Thank you, by the way, for the intel on the Turkish agents. You know, you were right when you recently told me that, um, it’s been difficult since Tom, but that I have Agnes, and I should be looking forward and not back.
[ Sighs ] I agree. I do. But so do you.
That makes two of us. … Thanks again for coming. It means a lot.
Hey.
We may not have bigger lives, but we have each other.
Everything okay?
Optimus. From what I understand, their servers store NSA data.
That makes total sense to me, which is why I’m certain you’ll completely disagree.
[ Scoffs ] And considerably less smug.
An anti-government group.
Optimus is the largest data storage company in the country. They contract with Fortune 500 companies and government agencies, including DOD, CIA, and NSA.
Optimus was running on backups because their power had been knocked out.
Reddington would say it is. He thinks we’re looking at a domestic threat.
[ Sighing ] No. I just, uh, had a friend helping me find something, and he’s having a hard time doing it.
I see plates. Did you run a BOLO?
[ Sighs ]
I do, but I-I can go through the data first.
Okay, where do you want to start?
So that’s where you want to start?
You know, as I recall, Samar didn’t want kids, either.
They are different, but you’re the same. I just don’t think it’s a coincidence you’ve fallen in love with two women who don’t want children.
What I think is you think too much. And if you’re meant to be with someone, all that matters is that you are. 
Yes. According to the data, none of the stolen files relate to national security.
At this point, we don’t know.
It’s not your fault. You did what you could.
So there were no hits on the guy I’m looking for?
A P.I.?
[ Sighs ] 
Nothing, honey. Your daddy just always taught me to be ready for a rainy day.
Aren’t you too smart for your own good? [ Claps ] Come here. Get up here.
Have I ever told you how your daddy and I met?
No? 
I spoke to Aram. Elodie’s husband died.
He said he’d be here as soon as he can.
You made him a hearing aid that blocks out sound. Is it really that common?
Server farms. You mean like data centers?
And home to an Optimus facility.
Dr. Lin says Purcell suffers acute auditory distress caused by the noise generated by the server farms, and he’s not alone. Apparently, thousands experience similar effects.
[ On phone ] Park. Park, cut the power.
Libby? Are you all right?
Park! Park! Alina!
Newton Purcell, you’re under arrest for the murder of Ryan Healy. 
We know about the hum.
The stars?
Is that why you killed Healy? Because you care?
Hopefully, they won’t think we beat it out of him.
Which put you into survival mode. I get it. But you crossed the line.
It’s blurry at times, but it’s there.
Which is why I get it– What you did to Purcell, what happened in Anchorage. It’s also why I understand that whatever it is that sets you off, you need to deal with it.
Fine. The case is over. It’s all good. I’m just checking in with you. How’s Elodie? 
And how are you?
I’m so glad to hear that.
Aram? Are you still there? 
Money’s in the backpack. And information on the target.
I want him found.
Need to know what?
And you want Reddington’s help?
Or – crazy idea– you could let the police investigate.
W-Where are we? Why are we here?
And what case is that?
You want us to find your trucks.
The Alaska Triangle.
[ Scoffs ] Okay. That can’t be true.
He was lost in a section of the state known as the Alaska Triangle.
What’s real about it is that an unusually large number of people do seem to disappear there.
Four months ago, he lost a shipment in the triangle. He attached a GPS tracker to the next one and found it here.
He wouldn’t say, but some of it has apparently shown up in Italy. He’s on his way to find out how.
It’s why Reddington wants him to. I think he should tell the police.
That’s why your phone’s been blowing up. Robby. What’s he done this time?
You can’t just ignore him. He’s family.
Park?
Those trucks have only one thing in common– you cleared them through the port.
I don’t know. I don’t like it.
Ressler, check this out.
Could be the next target.
You want to catch them in the act.
[ On phone to Park ] You’re like an ice-road trucker.
GPS says you’re still inside the triangle.
You shot their inside man.
What do you mean you’re clear? They let you through?
[ On comms ] Hey, Park, medics are on-site. We’re just waiting to see if they need any assistance before we head your way. Park, do you copy?
It’s isolated. No surveillance. Target vehicle approaches, gets waived out of line and hijacked, the GPS gets pulled, and no one’s the wiser.
Don’t tell me you listened to Reddington. I told you to have the police look into it.
Who?
What about the land granted to Operation Washtub? Have you located it?
Park’s history here is– complicated.
Park made mistakes. Connor covered on the promise Park would not return.
You have a black sheep in your family. Let’s just say Park has a black sheep of her own. 
Freeze!
Hey, where is she? Answer me.
Your men have her or are looking for her. Either way, you’ve been in communication. Where are they?
You okay?
You okay?
The one you’ve been hunting all these years. How is that possible? Did you know he was here?
How did you two end up in the same place together?
It’s strange. I know we solved at least part of the Alaska Triangle, but after all he was promised, it’s hard not to empathize.
And now he’s going to prison for the rest of his life.
I didn’t say anything because I don’t think you should do anything.
And I can understand why you would have a hard time accepting that. But when it comes to family, it’s complicated. I know that’s true for me. You know better than anyone, I haven’t always been my best self. I don’t think any of us have. Honestly, I think you should give her the benefit of the doubt. I think in a situation like this, we should give everyone the benefit of the doubt.
An armed robbery at a mini mart.
That’s the case– a shooting at a mini mart that left the clerk and one of the robbers dead at the scene?
And how do you know that?
You were there.
You know how he was killed because you killed him.
And who might that be? 
Fine Caliber Arms International is a 100-year-old gun manufacturer run by Gordon Kemp, who inherited it from his father eight years ago and promptly started making the FineCal 9.
And dozens of other cities. It’s the cheapest 9mm on the market. A gun with no collectible value except that it’s a readily available, affordable weapon for street-level criminals.
Reddington put Kemp on the Blacklist because police have seized more FineCals than every other semiautomatic weapon combined, and Kemp keeps flooding urban markets with them.
Reddington holds Kemp responsible for the death of Sofia Salgado. For some reason, seeing her die really got to him.
 It’s okay to flood high-crime neighborhoods with cheap guns?
It’s a crime to knowingly sell a gun to a criminal.
Maybe. He gave me a lead on the man who sold Edward Martell the murder weapon. He says if we find him, he’ll give us all the good faith we need. 
I’m here. Affirmative.
I’ve got eyes on Carly. She’s approaching now.
She’s a wreck. He’d have to be blind not to see it.
Heads up, that’s Kemp.
Unbelievable. Did you catch that?
Oh, he heard.
I say we take them both.
Kemp doesn’t want to know.
[ Low voice ] Gordon Kemp. Agents Keen and Ressler, FBI. You’re under arrest. We need you to come with us.
Keep your voice down. We’d like to do this quietly.
We need to do this quietly, sir.
It has to bother you that a young woman like Sofia Salgado was murdered using one of your guns.
Is that your vision for the world, Mr. Kemp? That we only care about people, about human life, when the law explicitly tells us we have to?
We’re looking at three identical trucks.
[ Exhales sharply ] Not now.
Not a good time.
I can’t talk.
 I’m hanging up now–
[ Shouts back to Ressler ] Copy that. On your go. [ To Red, on her phone ] I’m hanging up.
[ To FBI crew in the SUV with her ] Keep a bumper lock on that truck. You, too. Eyes wide.
[ To Cooper ] Yes, and I was just explaining to him that we have a job to do.
[ To Cooper ]Yes, sir. Understood.
Stay on 65?
Aram, we’re on Talmadge approaching Younes. There’s smoke on the horizon. Do you show any hazards ahead?
Don’t stop.
[ To truck driver ] Driver, lock down the cab. Do not exit the vehicle. [ To agents in the SUV ] You three, watch for an ambush.
Officer, I’m with the FBI.
Cooper, it’s a trap. We’ve been hit. It’s a trap.
[ Disbelief ] You lied to me. When you told me I’d be carrying the guns, you knew you were sending them with Ressler.
That whole conversation was fake, put on for my benefit so that I’d think I’d have the guns? [ Accusingly ] You don’t trust me.
Some laws deserve to be broken.
You knew I would tell him?
[ Quietly ] Because I have dark impulses.
[ Pause ] So what now?
It was Cooper. He tricked me.
That he doesn’t trust me?
A lot of good my principle did. Kemp got all of his guns.
What did you do?
Cooper says we blur the line between right and wrong so often, we can’t see it clearly anymore. I know I can’t.
Is everything all right?
At long last.
You were made. Ilya obviously knew you were watching him.
I was honest. I hired you to find Koslov so I could question him.
From my days in the Mobile Psych Unit. I’d like to dig into it.
You’re sure you don’t mind?
And you’re okay with my involving the team.
Of course.
Is there something wrong?
They called him the Boneyard Killer. His first victim was found just outside Rehoboth Beach when local police exhumed a body for autopsy. What they found was a second body buried in that same grave. A young woman four feet below the surface, resting just above a freshly buried coffin – murdered and hidden in the last place anyone would ever look for her. Since then, three women have been discovered this way in graveyards in Virginia and West Virginia. He was using the cemeteries as dumpsites.
They were fresh. Easy to dig.
All young women with a history of sex work.
True, but none of his victims were sexually assaulted, no sign of defensive wounds, no pre- or postmortem mutilation. But the way he killed them– we found dirt in their airways.
Alive, yes.
And unconscious. Pumped so full of sodium thiopental, they’d never wake up.
The case went cold until a week ago, when flash floods hit Montgomery and upended a few graves at Greenfare Cemetery, including one unidentified body that wasn’t supposed to be there. Initial forensics suggest she was sedated and buried alive just like the others.
No, and they’re not going to. They asked me to leave the case. They said my profile wasn’t– additive.
Yes.
I don’t think he wants to kill. I think he’s mimicking these profiles in order to hide some other agenda. What, I don’t know, but I think he finds satisfaction in something other than the act of the crime itself.
Uh, sir, can I ask for another favor? Reddington says that counterterrorism is sniffing around Dembe’s imam.
He wants to know what they found.
Syrian jihadists. Some of the congregants may be involved with Tahrir al-Sham. But Dembe thinks that’s impossible.
Ilya Koslov is out there somewhere, and I have no idea where.
I don’t. But she said her life depended on it.
Suffocation?
Was there any evidence of sexual assault?
She had a baby.
The self-help guru?
Well, how do you know that?
The victims we found eight years ago. Their bodies were so decomposed they didn’t have C-section scars like Mara’s, but take a look at this. Pockmarks along the pelvic bone caused by ligaments tearing during childbirth.
That’s what I thought, but it’s a good thing we know a criminal who can cut through the red tape. 
Medication, hospital visits. I get the impression he pays for whatever the file clerk needs.
We haven’t found a single one.
So five mothers who died soon after giving birth, and five fathers who died soon after conception.
And no one would question why a mortician was hanging around. Did you get an address?
He got a lead on the smugglers, [ Sighing ] and I think he’s going to pay them a visit.
He knows. He just doesn’t care.
Do you have any other way of reaching him?
We’re gonna need his current home address.
What the hell?
I’m not sure I want to know. 
Sixteen people drowned. DMORT was deployed to identify the victims.
The country is divided by region, and based on where the victims were found, Hatcher operates with Region III, which includes D.C., Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.
The rich dead man. The one Hatcher s-selected from his DMORT assignment.
We don’t think so.
Hatcher inseminated the women using semen he extracted from the corpses. Apparently, sperm is viable up to 36 hours postmortem.
The birds and the bees? [ Chuckles ] Lemme tell you, there’s a whole new wrinkle.
[ Sighs ] 
What’s the green area?
Where is she?!
Angela Hendrickson – where?!
Where is she, Nyle?
Which grave?
Answer me!
He doesn’t want her to suffer, so she’s sedated, but she may still be alive. We need to fan out. We’re looking for a fresh grave. There can’t be many. 
I feel something! [ Panting ]
She’s got a pulse.
The women you brutalized, how many were they?
And what – dispensable?
This was never about killing those women.
What did you do with the children?
What does that mean?
Needed you?
What’s gonna happen to those kids? What are they gonna say when they find out what you did?
We should tell the widows their husbands didn’t cheat on them.
Child Services is reaching out to the families of both parents. 
Hopefully someone will step up.
She’s under house arrest, awaiting trial. But mothers can keep their infants with them in prison for up to 18 months.
So this is what it’s all about. Asylum seekers.
I checked with MPD on my way over. They’ve got nothing. No forensics. No witnesses. 
How’s he holding up? 
You?
Dembe’s imam is not close to you. 
At first, I thought you screwed up, that Koslov ran because he knew you were following him. But then I realized Ilya wasn’t scared of you. You’re the one who’s scared. Reddington got to you. Ilya Koslov has information that could save my mother’s life. And you helped prevent me from finding it. The least you can do is tell me why.
[ Breathes deeply ] I had no idea he was one of them. 
What’s that?
What’s that?
Ressler, I– I’m not sure what I’m supposed to say.
I don’t know that I do agree. After the story you told me, after what you’ve been through – both of you–
Of course, yes, I will help you. I just want to make sure you’re prepared to face the consequences when the FBI gets their hands on that vehicle and that body. Because if we go in and arrest those people, eventually, the FBI’s gonna open up that trunk.
Are you really okay with dealing with the consequences of that?
Yeah, this is Agent Keen. Can I get SAC Patel in here, please? Thank you.
[ To Ressler ] I need someone local to run point with me on this. We should go over what the plan is.
We’ll be around the corner, two blocks away. 12-second response time, I’d guess.
It’s gonna be dangerous.
You know, I can still talk to Patel, call it off. I have the authority–
[ Over comms ] Ressler, you’re sure this is what you want?
We’re a go! Go, go, go, go!
Hey, you!
I wouldn’t say that. I don’t think I saved anyone. 
No. No, come in.
You say that like it’s a bad thing.
I learned from the best.
You were in trouble. You needed help.
Yeah, but I wasn’t.
Are you trying to say thank you? ‘Cause if that’s what you’re doing, you’re doing a terrible job of it.
You didn’t ask.
It wasn’t for you, knucklehead. It was for me.
Look, if you wanna ruin your life over something you did a lifetime ago – when you were a teenager, for God’s sake – then someday, sure, I’ll let you.
Yeah, you have my permission to be a total dipstick.
You’re a knucklehead and a dipstick, and you’re someone that I rely on, for, like– everything.
Have you looked at my life? I’m a widow and a single mom. A marionette – with a high-functioning sociopath pulling my strings. My grandfather tried to murder my mother, and my mother is a legendarily lethal Russian spy – who moved in next door without even telling me who she was. [ Sighs ] I mean it. Have you looked at my life? I mean, really taken a close look. Because it’s like I’m in the middle of a monsoon that’s constantly threatening to drown me in bad news. And somewhere in the middle of that FEMA disaster of a life– [ Voice breaking ] Somewhere is just – a tiny island of calm. And if that weren’t there, I would be swept out to sea.
It would if you weren’t here.
What’s that?
You say you have a lead.
This is one better – the criminal is inside a room no one can get out of.
Without a doubt.
His DNA would suggest otherwise.
Mr. Ruel, thank you for agreeing to speak with us.
You’re free to be charged with kidnapping. And depending on where the victim is, and what condition he’s in, you could be looking at anything from assault to murder by the time we’re through.
Why do you say that?
A list of prisoners in and out of Wallens Ridge in the last year.
He’s willing to talk. We’re working on immunity now. New hangout?
You bought a restaurant so you could eat vichyssoise?
I don’t like vichyssoise. Plus the name is terrible. It sounds like a Nazi collaborator.
What transition?
Yeah, that’s – not happening.
Of a criminal empire? I’m an FBI agent!
If it’s not what you planned, why do it? What changed?
Your lawyer. He’s at Wallens?
Any idea his condition?
All due respect, sir, this is a federal investigation. We’re gonna need to assist you in questioning any of the inmates or prison staff.
Your cell is next to Ruel’s. Any idea how his fingerprint ended up at a crime scene over 20 miles away?
You’re a hacker. Banks. Insurance companies.
And Ruel works in K&R. Only instead of getting people back, he took them.
You’re both known criminals.
An explosives expert.
My point is people with rap sheets like yours don’t usually end up in the isolation cell block. And yet here you are. Why is that?
It’s weird, right, the records of the inmates we spoke to. They didn’t merit isolation.
Hmm, could be. But trouble for whom? Who are they protecting?
Reddington wants to hand down his empire to me.
I didn’t think about it, and I’m not going to accept it, but it’s a little odd that he would bring it up now. He found out I hired a PI to shadow Ilya Koslov.
Yeah, and instead of confronting me about it, he decided to try and hand down the keys to his kingdom, and there’s got to be a reason.
His life is always in mortal danger.
What do you know?
Yeah. You said that was for an investment purpose.
What did it say?
Is that Marvin Gerard? Aren’t you supposed to be in lockup?
Well, that’s true for every prison.
You believe they’re putting inmates into isolation so they can let them out to commit crimes?
Yeah, that’s him all right.
No idea, but that’s what we’re gonna find out.
I don’t know. Call it in, see if Aram can give us any details.
For a closer look.
It’s them. The inmates from Wallens – guys we interrogated. Heavily armed.
From Wallens. They’re on site with enough military grade equipment to start a war.
Aram, they’re on the move. Get units here now. We’re in pursuit.
What the hell are they doing? I got the ones with the ladder.
Aram? 2318 Central Ave. Four unsubs. All armed.
I got something else – a car with government plates. Surveillance. This could be a sting. DC plates – six-brave-six-delta-five-November.
It’s a protective detail. Reach out and see what you can find out about operations. Whatever’s about to happens here is gonna happen fast.
Next door?
FBI! Stop right there! Freeze!
[ On comms, to Park ] The building next door is housing a witness – Sarah Wims. That’s the target.
Stop! FBI! Hands! Drop your weapon.
[ To Sarah ] You okay? It’s over.
 It’s gonna be okay.
I promise. 
Tell me how it worked.
We?
Who gave you these targets? Was it the guard Martin? Did he let you in and out of the prison?
Tell me about today’s target. Sarah Wims.
And she was an extraordinary target.
She’d agreed to testify against the Doyle gang. Mobsters who traffic heroin and cocaine.
Imam Sadiq Asmal.
You took him from his mosque. We need to know where he is.
Well, who does? Martin? Does he know?
Right now, I’m the only one looking out for you. And I can’t do that unless you give me a reason to. Like a name. 
[ On phone ] It’s the warden. The inmates he puts in isolation, he takes care of their families. And they take care of him.
He tells them what to do, and it’s very need-to-know.
No. They don’t. 
Dembe’s imam. Was that really necessary?
I mean was it necessary.
Does he know? That you’re alive?
You’re going after the people I care about–
I thought I already had.
Between you and him.
Between you and him.
You know his identity.
I know you’re Ilya.
Dom.
My nanny.
[ To Dom ] You put your granddaughter in harm’s way. You lied your way into my life.
You shot your father. You’ve caused pain and suffering for everyone I’ve ever cared about. Give me one good reason I shouldn’t end this right now.
She told me you lied to me about who Reddington is.
[ Her thoughts, voice-over ] What would I even say to you if I could? I don’t care who Reddington is, his secret – the one you lied to me about. But the people who’ve died to keep the secret – Tom, Mr. Kaplan – I did care about them. I loved them. And when they died, a part of me died with them. A good part here, a kind part there. Until, after seven years, I’m not sure what parts are left. 
I feel like a series of lights have been turned off and I’m standing at the edge of this darkness and that if I take one step closer to it, if I lose one more good part of me, I’ll be — transformed.
Please, tell me.
You think it’s time?
That would be nice.
Wouldn’t it?
Talk to me.
Yesterday, you were outside my house. The day before, you were outside my daughter’s school. You’re following me – for her. Take me to her. Come on.
Dom is off-limits.
Did you hear me? Stay away from him. [ To Simms, as he leaves ] And stop following me.
What he did? You put him in a coma.
After Koslov, the interrogation, when you went away–
Tell me.
I’m your daughter.
You know, you say you want answers. Well, so do I. When you’re ready to tell me yours, let me know. Until then, we’ve got nothing to talk about. And stop following me.
Are you all right?
I know four people were left dead, including two cops. New York Field Office says it was a botched hit.
The accountant?
You want us to find an accountant?
And you’re interested in these criminal escorts because–?
That’s why the Task Force should take the case, not why you’re giving it to us.
Pasha and Nshan Kazanjian. Conceived and born in prison, the only children of a female inmate held at the infamous Perm-36 labor camp. Taken from their mother and placed in a state-run orphanage but raised on the street. Today, they make their living as muscle for hire.
Yes. Only these bodyguards kill to protect their clients. A missing Indian crime boss, an exiled Thai politician, an accountant who hides millions for criminals – all contracted by the Kazanjian brothers. According to Reddington, the bloodshed in New York this morning was in service of protecting their newest client – Frank Merwin.
Reddington says Merwin is about to go underground, but if we get him first, he can lead us to the brothers.
I need to ask you something.
Her. 
To get the answers she couldn’t by abducting Dembe’s imam.
She told me she did it.
I made the tail, had him take me to her.
He’ll have her arrested.
If I turn her in, Reddington will get to her.
And so is he.
Any idea where the call came from?
What if he gave us this case just so the Task Force would find her for him?
He doesn’t know she and I are talking. And she doesn’t know that he might’ve given us a case that could lead him to her.
The last place I want to be.
I know. I’m just afraid of what we might find when we do. 
Agents Ressler and Keen – FBI.
[ To Mr Krupin ] You. Hey, who were you talking to?
I asked you a question.
Are you staying at this hotel?
Sir, answer my question.
Upstairs where? Where?
[ On phone ] Nothing yet. Get more units here right now. 
Ressler? It’s clear. 
They’re gone.
FBI. Put your weapons down.
Let her go.
Put the gun down.
Katarina Rostova. Know her? Maddy Tolliver? The Townsend Directive?
So – this is about my mother.
He didn’t say he knows, but he still told me.
I’m telling you, they know her. I was right to suspect there’s a connection. Reddington’s using us to get the Kazanjians so he can get to her.
Or a warning. Either way, it was a call to someone he trusted. Get Aram to run a trace.
Reddington. It’s time to get out of the middle. [ To Red ] Hey. We need to meet.
I’ll get there as soon as I can.
That depends.
On how well you answer some questions.
Sorry it took so long, but there’s nowhere to park, and, apparently, the owner is too cheap to hire a valet.
I am. For the truth. Any chance that’s on the menu?
I know you gave us the Kazanjian brothers to find Maddy Tolliver. I know you think she’s alive.
I’m past caring who you are.
We have a lead on the Kazanjians.
How do you know that?
Aram told you.
You sent Dembe. He won’t get there before Park.
Why?
Does she have a reason to harm us? Did you give her a reason?
Yes, I am upset with you. All of this is because of whatever it is you did to her.
We’re only here because of you.
Whatever you did, whatever happened between the two of you has put all of us in this situation.
You withhold information. You won’t answer my questions.
You won’t tell me the truth.
What’s happening? Reddington, can you hear me?
[ Distorted ] Reddington, can you hear me? Reddington, can you hear me?
I need a car. Yours. Anyone’s.
[ On phone ] Are you still having me followed?
[ To Simms ] The building where you found me this morning, we need to get him there now.
Now you’re following me, too?
That doesn’t make it okay.
[ To driver ] Take Fullerton. It’s faster. [ To Katarina ] So why did you help?
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, it’s– it’s okay. Y-You don’t– Uh, we’re getting you help.
You nearly bled him to death.
[ Distorted ] You know I have no idea what’s wrong with him– a tumor, cancer. Indigestion. [ Not distorted ] I see him every day, and I haven’t got a clue. You two, the truths you won’t share, the secrets you keep, I’m tired of it, of being caught in the middle.
Don’t start, not unless you’re willing to go all the way.
I’m serious. I’d rather hear no truth than a half-truth.
Which you want him to tell you. That’s the truth you’re looking for? This Archive?
Does he know that?
[ To driver ] Can’t you go any faster?
It’s complicated.
I’m back. And I brought you company.
And questions– more questions. More secrets.
So he’s really on the mend. That’s great. What about Reddington? We did an MRI. He had a cerebral edema, which we treated with–
Sorry, I didn’t mean what are his symptoms. I meant, what’s the cause? What’s wrong with him?
Because he told you not to?
I’m glad you can joke about it. It terrified me.
I had help.
No. You were yelling at me about her, and then you collapsed.
Was?
Because Dembe got to the Kazanjians first.
Right.
Why would he tell me about Wayne Otte? Why let me know that he could get to my mother?
But I can stop him, and I think he knows it. I can pick up the phone and warn her off, tell her not to send Otte.
You spoke to Reddington?
He always says that.
I don’t know who to believe or what to do.
[ Sighs ] 
On my way.
He’s on to you.
Reddington knows. About you, the Kazanjians.
[ To Park ] Uh, it’s Agnes. She fell at school.
Yeah, she’s fine. It’s just I think she’s scared.
Okay.
He gave us a case, which led him to the Kazanjians, and, I don’t know, he must have threatened them or something, but they admitted that they were delivering a payment that was meant for you to someone named Wayne Otte.
A fact he normally would keep to himself, but he didn’t. He’s testing me – us. He wants to know if I’m helping you.
Which I don’t care about. All I care about is that if Otte does show, Reddington will use him to get to you. I got to go, but you got to call it off. Otte cannot meet with Reddington.
Our agents are reviewing the documents we recovered as we speak.
If you cooperate, that couild change.
Who want you dead because you stole from them.
I think we’re done here.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Yes?
You do? Tell me what happened.
Otte? He showed?
No, I’m just– Was he helpful?
He refuses to cooperate. Otte – Was he helpful?
I didn’t do anything.
Well, I– How you feeling?
I don’t understand. I warned you.
I told you Reddington knew about Otte and to call off the meeting.
No, I want you to know what happened because you didn’t. Otte gave Reddington a way to find you.
Because you let him.
I’m on your side.
Yeah. Everything’s good. 
Hey. Doctors say you’re gonna wake up soon. When you do, I need you to know the person who did this to you, my mother, I’m on her side now. I’m committed to helping her find the truth she’s looking for. Anyone who is in her way is in my way. That includes you. And that includes Reddington.
[ Voice-over ] It’s strange. I was afraid earlier of that darkness I was telling you about. I’ve always feared it. Ever since Reddington entered my life, I’ve worried that his darkness might somehow overtake me, that it might just swallow me whole.
But now that I’m here, I’m not afraid. In fact, I embrace this part of me and wherever it takes us on our way to the truth. You and me and Reddington, I’m at peace with that. I embrace that. I consider it my destiny.
Mother, it’s me. I’m ready.
